Different perspectives on Shakespeare's impact on the world's stage will be seen at The British Museum, The Globe, The RSC International Shakespeare Festival (ISF), Dr Dee Opera at ENO, the Danny Boyle opening film to the Olympics and much more. This interest in Shakespeare's influence will continue into 2013 with the forthcoming V&amp;amp;A exhibition on Elizabethan England and 2014 will be the 450 anniversary of Shakespeare's birth when further Shakespearean events are planned. Shakespeare was a scientifically prescient writer and the Elizabethan era heralded the birth of modern science. Francis Bacon promoted the scientific method, knew Shakespeare and some say that Bacon is the true author due to the high science content. But Shake Sphere is the only event that will examine science. The RSC consider Shake Sphere's focus on science to be extremely important and view Shake Sphere as a legacy project of the ISF. The RSC want to collaborate with us in the Autumn of 2012 and the Spring of 2013 on shared public events. By taking to the streets of London during the Cultural Olympiad we plan to entertain and surprise the public by making a comparison between STFC science and Elizabethan methods. We will use two actors to communicate dramatised facts to the public. One actor will be an omnipotent Elizabethan &amp;quot;Alchemist&amp;quot;, a barber surgeon and member of &amp;quot;The School of Night&amp;quot; he mixes with the movers and shakers of the day including, Shakespeare, Dr Dee, Bacon, Galileo, Paracelcus and Walter Raleigh and taught them everything they know. As a product of Elizabethan times he is confused to be transported forwards 400 years. The other actor will be an omnipotent personification of STFC Frontier Science; called &amp;quot;STFC&amp;quot; this character will amaze &amp;quot;Alchemist&amp;quot; with how things have changed. With centuries of innovation and discovery between them, there will be much to bicker about and plenty of opportunity for jokes (such as Galileo is a sat nav system and Shakespeare a region on Mercury and the Mary Rose is on view). The audiences will be involved and asked to score points as the actors compete to top one another with gentlemanly banter and one-upmanship as they discuss fascinating science facts and relevant Shakespearean quotes. The Alchemist will keep wrongly diagnosing horrifying Elizabethan diseases in the audience and advocating equally horrifying Elizabethan remedies. With a focus on specific areas of research several scenarios have been devised enabling the actors to engage with the public. A little like &amp;quot;Doc&amp;quot;, the scientist in the Back to the Future movies, the Alchemist will be amazed by modern science, his need to comprehend aiding the audience's understanding. The STFC character will be played by a youthful, debonair actor and will be dressed in a smart Burberry suit supported with an ipad. The Alchemist will be played by an older actor and dressed as the bird-like Elizabethan Plague Physician with a 16th Century star chart and medicine cabinet. As they debate using their relative knowledge they will find common ground on the subject areas: Graphite, Magnetism, Navigation, Solar, Bacon, Paracelcus, Metallurgy, Synchrotron Light, Mary Rose, Disease, Blood, Mercury, Glass, Dentistry, and Astronomy. At the end of each scene the &amp;quot;Alchemist&amp;quot; will have to concede that &amp;quot;STFC&amp;quot; is a powerful wizard &amp;amp; many Elizabethan methods such as dried toad, blood-letting and mercury injections have been surpassed - but &amp;quot;STFC&amp;quot; will have to concede that Shakespeare's writing never has been. Then the &amp;quot;Alchemist&amp;quot; will share a secret - the plays were not written by Shakespeare or Francis Bacon, they were written by him! With their new, mutual understanding Alchemist and STFC depart the best of friends. Moving to a new site to start over with a new audience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Shake Sphere will be a RSC World Shake Sphere Festival Legacy Project, public talks will be staged in Stratford in the Autumn 2012 and Spring 2013. The Shake Sphere website &amp;amp; blog will link to the RSC website.In addition to the Albarn, Kakula Dr Dee Guardian piece, I will write at least two other pieces for The Guardian on Shake Sphere and The Guardian Science Podcast will come on the street with us. Guardian.co.uk is the world's 5th most popular on-line media, it receives over 39M fresh hits per month.I am one of the delegates at Beyond Tomorrow the 2012 British Humanist Association Conference. I will use this opportunity to promote Shake Spherehttp://www.humanism.org.uk/meet-up/events/view/172?page=1Shake Sphere will work with the Science and Technology Studies students at UCLhttp://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/and with the MSc Science, Communication and Society students at Kent. http://www.kent.ac.uk/bio/study/postgraduate/master/sc/index.htmlThere are firm plans to tour Shake Sphere to schools, universities and drama schools in 2013 and to take adapted formats to various festivals in 2013/2014.The Shake Sphere website will become an important, long-term resource, with science/literature information relevant to the national curriculum. The RSA School of Night public talk will be a good networking event.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/K002619/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
