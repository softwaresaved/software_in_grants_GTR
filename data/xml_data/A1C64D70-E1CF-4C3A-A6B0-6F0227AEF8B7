Although the UK's negotiating stance will be a key element in the process, the positions taken by other member states and the EU institutions -- the European Council, the European Commission, and the European Parliament -- will be instrumental in shaping the outcome. 'Negotiating Brexit' examines those positions. It will monitor, track and explain the changing political context and positions taken by the UK's negotiating partners, use this understanding to explore the negotiating possibilities available to the UK, and examine the implications of the outcome for the UK, the future of the EU, and the UK's relationship with the EU. For each member state and institution, it will explain who is in charge, how the negotiating position was defined, the main trade-offs made, and responses to relevant pressures.
Focused on the importance of understanding the practicalities of the UK's departure, 'Negotiating Brexit' will involve new short-term research activity, research synthesis, and user engagement. It will deliver research that is important, ambitious, and innovative, and outputs of lasting significance. The project is important, because it will deliver an authoritative account of negotiations that will fundamentally recast relations in Europe and shape the UK's economy, security and foreign policy for years to come. A key part of the research will be to assemble a unique collection of primary and secondary texts that will be made available to future generations of researchers. The project is ambitious in terms of its coverage and impact. As well as collecting data and reporting on 16 EU member states, EU institutions, the UK, and Norway (as the largest member of EFTA), it will test the main theoretical approaches applied in the study of international negotiations, which highlight variously the importance of interests, ideas and institutions. A project of such a scale can only be carried out collectively by a team of specialists with detailed knowledge not only of the EU, but of national political contexts or EU institutions, and with experience in engaging with non-academic audiences. 'Negotiating Brexit' is also innovative, first because by tracking the development of negotiating positions in real time, it departs from the tendency in the existing literature to explain the positioning of negotiating parties retrospectively in the light of the final outcome of the negotiations, and second, because by focusing on the politics of position formation in the member states, it does not attempt to proceed deductively from the potentially misleading assumption that actors are rational.
The research team will actively engage with users throughout the project's duration. It will deliver research syntheses, reports, blogs, and other material that are easily accessible to policy makers, businesses, journalists, civil society organisations, educational institutions and the general public who are interested in the UK's relationship with the EU. These analyses will be made available via the 'UK in a Changing Europe' knowledge hub at King's College London, especially through its website at http://ukandeu.ac.uk, and highlighted in its weekly newsletter. Drawing on the model of the texts published by 'The UK in a Changing Europe' senior fellows in 2016, the team will produce in electronic form two collective publications that will describe and explain the positions taken by other EU member states and the EU institutions. Two conferences will be arranged in London in June 2017 and September/October 2018, which will offer decision makers, interested groups and individuals, journalists, and members of the public the opportunity to discuss and debate the negotiating positions adopted by the UK's partner</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>'Negotiating Brexit' will combine research synthesis and rigorous analysis with an active strategy of engagement with practitioner and public debate on the Article 50 negotiation process. There are four main groups that will benefit from 'Negotiating Brexit', and the work and outputs will be tailored to meet their varying requirements.
The first audience is the mass media. The negotiations will be a major news story, of sustained and wide-ranging interest. Given the nature of the negotiations, the media will be vital actors in the construction and development of public debate. Due to their activities conducted as Senior Fellows under 'The UK in a Changing Europe' (UKICE), Kassim and Usherwood have extensive experience of working with the media. They will mobilise new and existing contacts, as well as liaising closely with Professor Menon as Director of UKICE and Ben Miller, the UKICE communications officer to maximise coverage of the findings from 'Negotiating Brexit' in the media. Since the subject matter of the negotiations is technical, detailed and requires specialist knowledge, there will be strong demand for contributions that are informed by research. The summarising work of 'Negotiating Brexit' will be central in meeting this need, supplemented by the conference debates, all of which will provide opportunities for engagement with local, national and international media outlets. In addition, there will be an active use of social media and blogging to provide high-tempo contributions.
Related to this work will be that with practitioners in party politics, civil society organisations and public administration, both at national and EU levels. Kassim and Usherwood will use their own existing networks, as well as relations at local, regional and national levels with governments and parliamentarians, politicians and civil servants, interest groups, NGOs and think tanks, developed as part 'The UK in a Changing Europe', and form new relationships, in order to communicate findings and analysis from the project. With an active and pressing public debate, the value of analysis based on independent analysis and expertise will be made clear to such users, grounded as it will be in an impartial and research-informed approach.
The wider public - in both the UK and across Europe - will also be a beneficiary from the research and user-engagement undertaken by 'Negotiating Brexit'. The availability of concise, informed research-driven materials, presented in clear and simple-to-understand terms will be of use in supporting and stimulating the debate about the future of UK-EU relations and the subsequent paths for both parts. The availability of Kassim and Usherwood through the online materials, social media (and mass media, to a lesser extent) will make it possible for members of the public to engage with this the debates, especially when there are more localised developments in the public debate. 
Finally, there is a major benefit to academics working on British, European and EU politics, and international relations. The analysis produced by the project and its reporting will provide a major source of material for scholars, and will inform academic debate and discussion throughout the negotiations and beyond. A combination of peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at academic conferences will be the avenues for dissemination primarily directed at this audience, supplemented by the organisation of the two conferences. This work will form the basis for on-going discussion and debate within the community, with its combination of original research and of summarising existing work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242375</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R001626/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
