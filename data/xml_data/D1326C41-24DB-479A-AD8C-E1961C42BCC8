The timing of this study allows for a unique opportunity to explore the impact of the new regulation on professional law firms, responses to a more commercialised environment and the implications for management. As well as highlighting changes in 'market conditions' and the 'institutional contexts' (Hinings, 2006) impacting upon organizational form and the legal profession, the study will have specific implications for the development of human resources in the sector and the skills needs facing the sector as identified by professional bodies, such as Skills for Justice. A key question is how far changing regulation will lead to changes not just in the organisation and delivery of legal services, but also in the skill mix of professionals themselves? A 2009 report, for example, indicated that the future skills needs in the legal sector include generic managerial skills around partnership working, business planning and change management, as well as commercial skills and tendering and unit cost skills. The Legal Education and Training Review (due to report in May 2013) is currently exploring these themes looking at the skills and knowledge required by lawyers in future and the impact of reforms on their monopoly status.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45080</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>LSB research into investment in the legal sector - workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>33E2DF7E-5618-4F8B-80D3-7077A5971457</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Legal Services Board organized a workshop on 1 December 2016.

Phase I comprised analysis of secondary data sources and took place between July 2013 and February 2015. The second phase comprised qualitative research with Alternative Business Structures and private equity firms. Data collection began in March 2015 and continued through to August 2015. This data set has yet to be analysed and will be reported on next year. Thus, key findings reported upon below relate to Phase I of the research. 

The introduction of the Legal Services Act 2007, depicted as part of a &amp;quot;global tsunami against self-regulation&amp;quot; (Patton, 2008), represented a powerful mechanism to transform the delivery of legal services. Indeed, the removal of historic restrictions relating to the financing, management and ownership of legal practices - via the introduction of 'Alternative Business Structures' - attracted international comment and controversy for their 'radical' nature. The official and academic literature anticipated the legal services market to change radically as a result of increased competition, innovation, the entry of new providers, and extensive capital investment. 
As one of the first in-depth studies focusing on Alterative Business Structures, this study provides evidence of slow, incremental change, thereby challenging the official assumption that radical reforms would encourage radical change. To arrive at this conclusion, the The study employed the following proxies to measure radical change: (a) change sin the population of the field (market), either by an influx of new entrants or a large proportion of existing law firms converting to an ABS status; (b) a large proportion of ABSs extending ownership to non-lawyers through the appointment of managers; (c) large proportion of ABSs extending ownership to non-lawyers by raising capital investment. 
Taking each of the proxies in turn, the study found that the LSA did not lead to a radical change in the composition of the legal series market. ABSs represent little more than 3% of the total solicitor firm population and the majority of these comprise conversions by the incumbent population. However, the study did find that conversions were not spread evenly across the incumbent population. On the contrary, it highlighted uneven impact across market segments with law firms providing personal legal services, particularly those relating to personal injury, the most like to convert to an ABS. Their conversion reflects the joint outcome of policy reforms unique to this segment (LASPO 2012) and wider competitive pressures, including the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis. 
Moreover, the study found that, contrary to official and academic expectations, new providers did not enter the legal services in the scale imagined. On the contrary, new entrants are conspicuous because they are few in number. Yet, even though new entrants are few in number, the study uncovered important insights as to their characteristic and motives. The study revealed that new entrants primarily originate from two adjacent fields, that is, accountancy and insurance, although motivations and strategies for entering the legal services differed between the two sets of actors. 
With regards to the former, the study found that the vast majority of ABSs have extended ownership to non-lawyers and that often this was a primary motivation for seeking this status. With regards to external investment, the found that few firms had opted to take advantage of this opportunity. The study provides three explanations for this: (a) the business model of private equity firms; (b) the resilience of the partnership model; (c) disinclination of law firms to access external investment. 
Overall, conclusions from Phase I of the study are that the structural characteristics of the legal services field supported convergent change and hindered radical change.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings from this study would be of value to regulators of the legal profession in the UK as well as international regulators and professional bodies in Canada, the USA (and elsewhere) to inform policy decisions about liberalising legal services in their jurisdictions. In the UK, findings from this study will benefit the SRA, the LSB and the Legal Services Consumer Panel by drawing out conclusions concerning the impact of liberalisation and making an informed assessment regarding the degree to which reforms are making legal services accessible and helping to address the justice gap. This will prove particularly valuable as enabling legal need to be effectively met constitutes a primary aim within the LSB's strategic plan for 2015-18.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F486B50D-F927-4C70-AA73-2EA321BA83DC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>I have created a database of ABS firms, which includes information about firm characteristics and qualitative information about motivations for becoming an ABS, views on equity investment and organization structure and management arrangements.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C44A89D2-BB63-4D95-9A4A-0F8FABC68BB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The database has allowed me to create a taxonomy of different types of ABSs, which hitherto did not exist.
