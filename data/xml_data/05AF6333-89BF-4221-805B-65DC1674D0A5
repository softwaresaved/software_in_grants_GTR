Both geographers and economists point to the increasing concentration of economic activity and wealth creation in cities, and their crucial importance as the loci of national prosperity. National governments and international bodies have likewise recognized the key economic role that cities play, and have correspondingly directed attention to cities as the foci of policy intervention and governance reform. In the UK, interest in the economic performance of cities takes on particular importance given the Government's concern spatially to rebalance the economy between the less prosperous North and the more prosperous South. 'Powering up' northern cities to unlock their growth potential is seen as crucial to securing that political imperative. This project is intended to help inform these concerns and debates by focusing on how far and in what ways, over the medium to long term, cities have differed in their ability to reorientate and transform their economic structures in response to or anticipation of changes in demand, competition, trade, and technology, and how those differences have then influenced the comparative growth paths of cities. 
While a city's growth performance is influenced by a wide range of factors, over the medium to long run, much turns on how successful a city is in moving out of old declining or slow-growth sectors of activity into new more dynamic ones. If, for some reason, a city's economic structure becomes increasingly uncompetitive, outmoded, or falls behind in productivity, it will fall behind in economic growth, job creation, per capita incomes and welfare. What matters then, especially when viewed over the medium to long term, is what some economists call the structural dynamics of economic growth, or adaptive growth. It is this key issue that this research project seeks to explore, in relation to some 70 cities across the UK. There is some evidence to suggest that cities have differed significantly in economic growth in recent decades, especially as between more southern cities and more northern ones. How far these divergent growth evolutions have been influenced by differences in structural transformation and reorientation is the basic focus of this research. Most of the analysis will focus on the past forty years, since 1971, a period when, nationally, a major shift in the national economy has occurred from manufacturing to services. How the structural details of this shift have played out across Britain's cities, and with what consequences for city growth patterns, are key questions the research seeks to address. 
To address the research aims, new data sets for British cities will be constructed, on employment and output for numerous individual sectors. For a more recent period, since 1991, it is also possible to examine in some detail the role of various city-specific factors (such as agglomeration, skills, innovation and firm demographics) in explaining differences across cities in structural adaptation and economic growth. Further, some 10 case study cities will be examined in yet more detail over this more recent period, with a view to ascertaining how local economic and industrial policies and what are increasingly called governance arrangements (for example locally active and collectively acting political and business institutions) have interacted with and shaped the pace and direction of structural change and economic growth. It is intended that the research will not only contribute to our understanding of city economic evolutions, but also help to inform current policy debates about the creation of a 'northern powerhouse' centred upon Britain's northern cities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Impact Target Community 
The principal non-academic beneficiaries are anticipated to be economic policy makers at both national and local scales, to assist understanding about the impact of structural change on city-region economies and the policies that are required to enable their local resource base to adjust accordingly. 
Other beneficiaries include the business community and in particular those who assist with the workings of labour, land and property markets in the broadest sense including the housing market.
 
2. Engagement Activities
Our plans for engagement and dissemination include;
i) Developing a web-site that will focus on promoting understanding of the impact of structural change on local economies and co-ordinated with social media channels including a project blog, Twitter feed and LinkedIn group; 
ii) Working closely with the Centre for Cities to ensure that all key findings are disseminated through their extensive network of contacts and publicity channels (see below);
iii) Holding three workshops during the course of the work to bring together academics, policy makers and professionals; 
iv) Extensive development of professional research networks. involving HM Government, local authorities and the research community to make the relevant user groups aware of the research; 
v) Knowledge exchange with local authorities through the Local Government Association, Local Enterprise Partnerships and other similar bodies in order to make them aware of the research and its findings;
vi) Distribution of four short (non-technical) summary documents and policy briefings targeted at end-users;
vii) Organisation of of a major conference to be held in Cambridge in Summer 2018 that would be an opportunity to bring together the research studies findings with that of other academic work on City and Regional Structural Adaptive Change from an International Perspective.

3. Milestones and Measures
Key measures include: 
i) Establishing a Project Steering Group consisting of 8 members, four of which would be drawn from representatives from local and central government; 3 would be from the academic research community, and one from private sector data providers. 
ii) Regular meetings of the project Steering Group to review progress on engagement and delivering impact. 
iii) A workshop towards the end of year one would seek feedback from participants on the quality and effectiveness of the research to date. 
iv) A second workshop in the middle of year two would be concerned to discuss and disseminate a number of emerging findings 
v) A third workshop towards the end of the project would seek to communicate further research, including the case-study city findings, results to a wide range of the beneficiaries targeted above and would be seen as the basis for the final round of dissemination activity.

4. Resources for Dissemination: Using the Centre for Cities to Maximise Impact
Given the importance of impact, and the potential relevance of the project for policy-makers and others involved in city economic development, the project will utilise and harness the expertise and dissemination facilities of the Centre for Cities in London. The Centre has an extensive network of stakeholders and key actors involved in city development and policy across the national urban system. Their services will be used to help disseminate the research findings of the project. The Centre will assume most of the administrative, organisational and promotional activities associated with our Workshops and Conference, together with designing and issuing publicity on the project, including the summary documents and policy statements referred to above. They will work alongside and under the guidance of the Pi and Co-Is to ensure the widest possible impact of the project. We regard the involvement of the Centre for Cities in our impact strategy as a key strength.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>688049</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organised session at Regional Studies Association Winter Conference in London</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F167E81-92B8-4436-AF36-55685EBEE915</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organised a special session at the Regional Studies Association Winter Conference in London on 24 and 25 November 2016, to present our ongoing work.

1. The economic growth paths of cities in the UK over the past 5 decades have been highly divergent. In terms of both employment and output, southern cities have grown faster than northern cities. Further, the fastest rate of growth have been among smaller and medium sized cities: the major cities (regional capitals) have been among the slowest growing. The exception is London, which after growing slowly up to the late-1980s, has since been one of the fastest growing cites in the UK.
2. There is also a north-south division of cities in terms of productivity, with almost all northern cities having labour productivity levels, both in 1971 and in 2014, below the Great Britain average. While northern showed some tendency to 'catch up' with the southern counterparts over 1971-1991, the process stopped thereafter, and southern cites pulled ahead.
3. Contrary to much of the academic literature, our research finds that a city's economic structure - its sectoral make-up - explains very little of its growth rate relative to other cities. In fact, cities have become increasingly similar over time in their sectoral structures: there has been sectoral convergence at the same one there has been divergent growth. What seems to be more important in determining a city's growth are local' city-specific' factors other than structure. It is not so much what cities do that matters, but how well they do what they do. This finding is now being explored, to try to identify what these 'city-specific' (or what are sometimes called 'competitiveness') factors are.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are of relevance to policy makers. Indeed, our work has attracted the attention of HM Treasury, the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Some of our data and findings have also been used as inputs to major studies for the National Infrastructure Commission, and Transport for the North.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2DFC9EE5-803E-4F82-9F37-9EBB838C87C6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cityevolutions.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A361C169-9C60-4FA8-89E6-4E3AC3D37730"><gtr:id>A361C169-9C60-4FA8-89E6-4E3AC3D37730</gtr:id><gtr:title>Divergent cities in post-industrial Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c1a514435b34eb9e88d597d93df12788"><gtr:id>c1a514435b34eb9e88d597d93df12788</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C5488068-A810-492F-9B3D-0CB8965FB9ED"><gtr:id>C5488068-A810-492F-9B3D-0CB8965FB9ED</gtr:id><gtr:title>Divergent cities in post-industrial Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c1a514435b34eb9e88d597d93df12788"><gtr:id>c1a514435b34eb9e88d597d93df12788</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/820DCFB4-263E-458A-A076-3D6A987C3B7D"><gtr:id>820DCFB4-263E-458A-A076-3D6A987C3B7D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Divergent Urban Economic Development: Reflections on a Tale of Two Cities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Regional Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4a4204cb3c69e703e79d6eab563df333"><gtr:id>4a4204cb3c69e703e79d6eab563df333</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin R L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N006135/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>250B44D8-B3A0-486E-B201-E6F45B9C3DD7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
