This work increases security and confidence in such protocols and their applications (e.g. in e-commerce and voting), to the benefit of protocol designers, businesses, governments, and application users.The United Kingdom has traditionally been a world leader in research into, and applications of, formal methods. Work in the UK on the foundations of languages and notations such as CSP, pi-calculus, and Z have led to their widespread use in critical systems development in industry.The UK is also well known to contain leading experts in cryptography. In the last two decades we have done important work in stream cipher design, symmetric ciphers (differential and algebraic cryptanalysis), elliptic curve cryptography, identity based cryptography and in protocols (e.g. in the mobile phone industry).In the 1990s in the UK, formal methods were successfully applied to the modelling and verification of security protocols at a high level of abstraction. However, modern cryptographic protocols contain probabilistic and complexity theoretic aspects which require a different set of abstractions. Several approaches for dealing with this have appeared since, including: automated proof-checking; compositional techniques; higher level proof structures; abstractions of computational models; and specialised logics.The network aims to bring together research groups working in the UK in these areas, starting with 7 sites and expanding rapidly from that.It will allow a systematic and effective cross-fertilisation between the differing strands of work. The consortium contains mathematicians and computer scientists, experts on cryptography, on formal methods, and on their interconnection, and developers of practical cryptographic protocols both from academia and from industry. A group with such a very broad spectrum of expertise will enable both(a) informing/strengthening practical developments by solid mathematical analysis, and (b) motivating foundational analysis by practice-based needs and requirements.To do so the network will organise meetings around both fundamental and more directly applicable issues, such as:- adequate abstractions of cryptographic primitives;- specialised specification notations with notions of probability, timing, and complexity;- abstract concepts and logics that allow the expression of security properties and reasoning about them;- practical protocols, e.g. e-voting, trust management, and those involving zero-knowledge proofs and commitments which formal methods cannot currently deal with.With these interests and questions in mind, the overall aims of CryptoForma are to:- bring together academics and industrialists interested in the application of formal methods to the specification, development and verification of cryptographic protocols;- stimulate collaboration between individuals and groups in order to tackle the questions highlighted above;- disseminate problems and results to researchers and practitioners in the field and to the wider communities in cryptography and formal methods.To achieve this research meetings and workshops are planned which will foster collaboration and disseminate key results.This proposal is timely and important because- society has recently experienced a reduced confidence in protection of electronic data, and in applications such ase-commerce and e-voting;- a critical mass of researchers in this area exists in the UK but this is not being exploited;- the subject is high on the agenda of research institutions, industries and academics world-wide. This is evidenced by the letters of support and the enthusiasm for the preliminary meeting of the network in January 2009 where all partners and 10 others will meet.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73820</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FOSAD summer schools</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B5A551BE-FA8B-45DD-84F0-90471E44333E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CryptoForma became a partner in the international FOSAD summer school.

With attendance at meetings double what was predicted in 2008, it has also established itself as an important forum for training PhD students. In 2012 it will be a partner in the organisation of the premier international summer school in formal methods for security, FOSAD in Italy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- Economic impact. The network aims to develop techniques to improve confidence in cryptographic and security protocols. These protocols, and the cryptographic primitives they are based on, are used to establish information security in specific security-sensitive applications such as electronic commerce, but also all internet-based business communications and information storage. In particular, researchers in the network (Paterson et al at RHUL) have found security problems in the SSL protocol, which is part of the standard method for secure encrypted communication with web services, probably used by literally billions of people. Several groups in the network (Ryan et al at Birmingham; Chadwick et al at Kent) work on secure protocols for cloud computing, which has become a standard model for commercial data storage for small and medium sized businesses; full homomorphic encryption as being developed e.g. by Smart et al at Bristol is considered to be a crucial candidate component for ensuring confidentiality of data in the cloud, even against the cloud provider.



This kind of impact is achieved in a number of indirect ways. Security errors in established software are reported as a matter of routine to the writers and distributors of such software, as well as on internet forums where the practical security community collects reports of known bugs and vulnerabilities. Tools developed for finding security errors tend to be made publicly available through open source projects, or through spin-off companies. The more general techniques underlying such tools are published academically, in textbooks, and included in postgraduate and undergraduate university courses. Design principles which avoid particular types of security problems are shared in similar ways.

Also, several network members are in industrial research laboratories (HP, Microsoft) or have close collaborations with industrial partners outside this network which allow the exploitation of novel security protocols, for example in the mobile phone industry (see attached letter of support from Vodafone).



- Societal impact The protocols considered in the network include protocols for secure communication with web services (as described above), which have great societal value as well as economic value. Protocols for data integrity and to support confidentiality or even availability of networked resources are a crucial component of cyber security. A particular topic of interest in the network is electronic voting (groups at Surrey and Birmingham) which is of a potentially large value for governments anywhere. Several experiments in this area have been cut short due to a lack of confidence in the schemes used to establish security properties in this; this research network is aimed at increasing such confidence through mathematics and logic based methods.



Again this kind of impact is achieved in indirect ways. Project partners are involved in multidisciplinary collaborations to study and introduce electronic voting. Other methods for achieving impact are as above for economic impact.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>524B762F-B6D0-4094-9F5B-A610B2DE2F77</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cryptoforma.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AB6B414B-EBF1-4105-953F-B6B0C6CD6E80"><gtr:id>AB6B414B-EBF1-4105-953F-B6B0C6CD6E80</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mathematics of Program Construction</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9580ae2a96c96eee7cf306e8c1e9c7e5"><gtr:id>9580ae2a96c96eee7cf306e8c1e9c7e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Boiten E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-3-642-13320-6</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G069875/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
