Crossing, contesting and comparing boundaries</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N008626/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Security concerns - about crime, terrorism, mass death atrocities and disasters - are a key driver for the development of new technologies, and human genetics research has played an important contribution here. DNA technologies provide vital resources for the identification of human remains and the production of information that can help to provide evidence in complex crimes. 

Sometimes, new forensic technologies have been adopted rapidly while their adequate regulation has been delayed until, in specific instances, unintended uses and impacts have emerged after deployment (e.g. indefinite storage of DNA samples from children in criminal DNA databanks). In other cases, extensive legislative deliberations have preceded, and sometimes rejected, technology implementation. There is a need to collate existing knowledge about the opportunities and challenges that accompany the adoption of forensic genetic technologies to ensure that they respect privacy and human dignity.

Three linked observations will shape the focus of the seminar series. 

(1) Comparing DNA uses in security and health contexts: Seminars will identify differences in aims, responsibilities, obligations, and underlying values between the two domains of security and health. For example, whilst issues of informed consent may be central to the use of genetics in healthcare and health insurance, justice and security contexts prioritise speedy identification of dangerous offenders, the production of credible evidence in court, or the unequivocal identification of victims. This prepares participants for the following work.

(2) Identifying issues in the use of medical data in security contexts: Seminars will explore the actual and potential issues that arise when medical data become available to security efforts via the use of novel forensic genetic technologies. Forensic uses of DNA have so far consisted of matching samples from crime scenes, unidentified persons, or volunteers, with existing DNA profiles (e.g. on a DNA database). Novel technologies are anticipated to provide much more information about the donor of a sample, for example their appearance, age, even behaviour. This can impact on the way society understands and treats health data, especially when information is vital in the face of serious criminal, terrorist or mass disaster threats. Seminars will also explore how such novel technologies have already been used, and compare the legal and ethical contexts of their application.

(3) Comparing uses of forensic genetic technologies across countries: DNA technologies and data are increasingly used across national borders. National variation in criminal laws, privacy legislation and police practices render this process very complex. For example, there are differences in who can be asked to give a DNA sample by police forces. Seminars will, by inviting leading scholars from Europe and the USA, compare practices and public and professional debates across a variety of jurisdictions. The development of good practice in the UK can be informed by learning from experience elsewhere, and expectations and misunderstandings in the cross-border use of these technologies can be addressed.

The seminars will bring together academic researchers, policy makers and practitioners from policing organisations, commercial forensic service providers, public sector organisations and civil society groups, in the UK and abroad, to discuss how such technologies can be used to support security while respecting freedom. A network of those involved will be established to disseminate existing and to design new research to inform UK policy and practice on the uses of genetic information to address the societal challenges of justice and security.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This seminar series will impact on academic communities, criminal justice and disaster management practitioners, UK policy makers and public sector representatives, and wider publics.

(1) Practitioners, such as forensic service providers and senior representatives of law enforcement agencies, tend to be well informed about the ways that forensic technologies are deployed in their jurisdiction and abroad. They have practice-informed expectations about current technologies in use, but may not be aware of the reasons for other stakeholders' concerns about risks of technology use. Insights into non-practitioner perspectives - academic and civil society - will supplement practitioners' focus on utility and process with knowledge about social and ethical aspects of technologies, and how the use of the technology affects wider issues than forensic lab work and investigative practice. Equally, practitioners will become more aware of the complexity of technology adoption, and the opportunities and challenges brought by technology adoption across medical and forensic domains and by the cross-national use of technologies. Participating practitioners will be encouraged to contribute to, and collaborate in, new research idea generation and research projects.

(2) UK policy makers and public sector representatives will benefit from the consolidation of social science perspectives on this underexplored area as well as from the formation of a group of multi-disciplinary experts as a community of forensic practice and practice analysis. They will have opportunity to discuss policy and governance of genetic technologies development and emerging uses, and build links with those studying and practicing forensic science. Although scholarly and practical forensic science issues are highly significant, their visibility from social scientific perspectives is often obscured due to the tendency of forensic science to slip between academic disciplines.

(3) UK publics will benefit from information coming out of the seminar series that will assist in the assessment of existing social and natural science research on the security uses of genetic technologies. The inclusion in the seminars of civil society groups like Genewatch, Liberty, The Nuffield Council on Bioethics, and Sense About Science and the Science Media Centre, will ensure that the perspectives of interest groups on civil liberties and science advocacy will be integral to discussions of current research and practice, as well as in new research idea generation. This, in turn, will enable publics to better form judgements about the benefits and risks posed by these uses. They will also benefit from practitioners' increased awareness of the wider social impacts of the use of genetic technologies on criminal justice and security practices. 

Organisers and participants of this seminar series have worked in a variety of fields pertaining to criminal justice, disaster victim identification, genetics research, policing and public policy-making. They and their organisations will benefit from the exchange of experiences, a raised awareness of different perspectives, and the mutual learning that will take place during seminars and subsequent collaborations. 

The seminar series will foster a more systematic approach to the collaboration of multi- and interdisciplinary expert communities. By drawing on diverse expertise and a broad spectrum of perspectives, the discussions throughout the event series will provide insights into practices of security and criminal justice uses of forensic genetic technologies, thus facilitating broader awareness to complement the depth of participants' specialisations. These discussions are essential for developing good practice models for the use of the science and technologies of genetics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30283</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Coimbra</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Portugal, Portuguese Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>EXCHANGE research project</gtr:description><gtr:id>F646CDFC-3095-4EA9-BAED-6AB98815D8B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One output is a position paper published in 'Forensic Science International: Genetics' (Toom, Wienroth et al. 2016).

Such a debate can contribute to ensuring robust legislation and improving police training and practices when interpreting genetic analyses and using such genetic data. The open letter was distributed to various media outlets and placed online. 
One considerable impact from this intervention is the invitation of two authors, including Matthias Wienroth, to speak at a symposium organised by the German Justice Department in Berlin in March 2017.

In doing so he has contributed to the political debate that has developed in Germany since 2016 about adopting new, more intrusive DNA analyses in police investigations.

Each seminar focuses on a specific topic in this context. With four (out of the planned six) seminars having taken place in 2015/16, several key findings and new areas for research have already emerged; they are summarised here.

Seminar 1: 'Genetics and crime. Contested boundaries, benefits and risks'
Communication, cross-disciplinarity, and improving the governance of technology were the key themes of the inaugural seminar. Communication between different stakeholders about technology requirements and limitations remains a core issue that needs to be improved upon. New research is required to explore how the usefulness and societal legitimacy of new technologies can be assessed more quickly, how less useful or less legitimate technologies can be identified and avoided, and how useful technologies can be co-developed with good governance mechanisms to overcome the 'law lag' between technology development and use. E.g., research into reliable data infrastructures - managing data from the use of genetics technologies - and their robust governance is necessary. More detail can be found here: https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/media/14568040/esrc_forensicgenetics_seminar1_outcomes.pdf

Seminar 2: 'Comparing stakeholder discourses about genetic technologies'
The key themes emerging in the second event in the series were (i) discourses of credibility and (ii) the utility of forensic genetics technologies. A vital element in the discussions was the standardization of forensic genetics practices at the international level. Key questions, especially for representatives of civic society organisations, included: whether international ethical norms and standards can be inferred for forensic genetics uses, and can a wider set of stakeholders (including police, academics, civic society) be involved in standardisation, and if so, how. Questions over the interpretation of increasingly complex forensic genetics data were raised particularly by forensic scientists and practitioners: how can standards for the acceptable quality of data be set; what are the advantages and limitations of verbal interpretations of probabilities, and of computer software (probabilistic algorithms) when interpreting and presenting evidence? Representatives of the judiciary made the point that users of forensic information need to be able to understand it even if they lack specialist statistical knowledge. Social science stakeholders identified the need for anticipatory research into social and ethical dimensions of forensically-relevant scientific research as crucial central consideration in the development of technologies. Is it possible and useful to draw analogies between forensics and medicine in terms of translating scientific knowledge into operational innovations; can these help to illuminate understanding of the challenges to forensic innovation? More detail can be found here: https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/media/22616558/seminar2_discussion_outcomes.pdf

Seminar 3: 'Comparing the use of DNA in criminal investigations &amp;amp; DVI across European borders'
Seminar 3 explored differences and tensions between local and global levels of forensic genetics, adversarial and inquisitorial criminal justice systems, forensic and social analyses, and personal and social identities.
The discussions identified that in-depth, interpretivist studies, capable of exploring how forensic science agency is located within the investigative order of both adversarial and inquisitorial criminal justice systems, is needed. Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) recurred as a topic in several talks and discussions, with further enquiries needed into the notion of 'exhaustive recovery' of human remains and its investigative, social and economic impacts. Attention was drawn to the identity politics of the use of new technologies, and how assertions of the genetic nature of relationships, appearance, and social groupings claim to enable attributing social identities via the use of forensic genetics technologies. This suggests that there is a considerable need to attend to practices, implications, and the governance of identity practices and politics.

Seminar 4: 'Comparing forensic and medical genetic technologies'
The fourth seminar discussed the differences and similarities in the uses and governance of genetic technologies across these two domains; the challenges that might arise from the multiple uses that can be made of genetic information, and the responsibilities that rest with the different stakeholders in acting as collectors and providers of, and guardians for, such information. Five overlapping themes for further sociological and socio-ethical research emerged; it was suggested that these form the basis of an exploration of what can be learnt from comparing practice and governance in each of the two domains of forensics and medicine , and to anticipate emerging overlaps: (1) exploring the socio-cultural positionings of key concepts (e.g. 'investigation,' 'body,' different 'identities') that underpin these areas of work; (2) considering overlaps and interfaces in genetic practice between the two fields; (3) comparing the 'health' and 'forensic' cultures to analyse how genetics is constituted in each field, how publics are constructed, how trust is produced etc.; (4) explore how 'participation' and 'ownership' are framed in forensic and medical genetics; and (5) attend to governance similarities and differences.

The seminar discussions have identified areas of social science that can create impact in the security and justice context and also identified several avenues for further research in the social sciences. Discussions have started to formulate research questions and rationales. In conjunction with the network building opportunities via the seminars, collaborative and cross-disciplinary research proposals can be developed.

Non-academic
Many key non-academic stakeholders attended the seminars so far, including key policy makers from the Home Office and from civic society. These contributors and users of the seminar series have been encouraged to collaborate with academic researchers in attending to the research avenues identified and formulated. Discussions at seminars, to which policy-makers, forensic practitioners, Third Sector/civic society representatives have contributed, provide information for producers, commissioners and users of forensic genetics technologies to reflect and improve current practices and governance of forensic genetics use.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>843ED0FD-06B1-4226-BCB7-7D889FE9DDB6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.northumbria.ac.uk/forensicgenetics</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CF72B586-399B-4D94-A8B4-EF3EDA4522C5"><gtr:id>CF72B586-399B-4D94-A8B4-EF3EDA4522C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Approaching ethical, legal and social issues of emerging forensic DNA phenotyping (FDP) technologies comprehensively: Reply to 'Forensic DNA phenotyping: Predicting human appearance from crime scene material for investigative purposes' by Manfred Kayser.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Forensic science international.
