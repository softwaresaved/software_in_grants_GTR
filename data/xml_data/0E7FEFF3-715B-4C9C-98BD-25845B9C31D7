A comprehensive report on long hours of work and adverse health effects based on a survey of Inspectors and interview data was recently published. Obstacles to hours? reform in an emergency service that plays a high risk/high demand role in the community must be balanced against Inspectors routinely working beyond the legal limits of the Working Time Regulations. The evidence base is sufficiently compelling that the parties cannot continue to treat long hours as a natural or unavoidable part of being a Police Inspector.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The core activity of the KE project is to jointly organise a series of 11 regional workshops to promote engagement with and impact from the available evidence base. In addition to our own input, these workshops will involve contributions from lawyers and occupational health specialists to establish common ground for all parties to work together, to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, the dissemination of good practice, and the identification of more effective methods to monitor, manage and balance the working hours and working lives of Inspectors.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to improve the health and wellbeing of Police Inspectors in England, Scotland and Wales by developing more effective ways to manage, monitor and balance hours of work. The key and direct beneficiaries will therefore be those who occupy the Inspecting Ranks, but benefits will also accrue to their families, their work teams, the Police Service and the communities it serves. There is particular concern about the impact of excessive working time on female Inspectors and how this might create a 'sticky floor' as opposed to a 'glass ceiling' (i.e. the 'requirement' to work long hours at more senior ranks makes it more difficult for women to gain the experience they need in particular roles and therefore to progress through the ranks).

Beyond the Police Service there is growing concern about wellbeing and work-life balance, reflected in the government's response to Dame Carol Black's review of the health of Britain's working age population and on-going research coordinated by the ONS. Within the academic research community there is growing interest in how professional occupational groups manage their working time, especially when they have access to flexible working arrangements (specifically, why do some professionals use flexible working arrangements, smart phones and the like to extend their working day rather than achieve a better work-life balance).

Having established the nature and extent of long working hours in the Police Service within the Inspecting Ranks, and having identified the principal causes of working 'beyond the call of duty' (e.g. lack of resilience, the failure to systematically record and monitor working time, the 'macho'/'can do' workplace culture, the desire of many Inspectors to secure promotion to Chief Inspector and Superintendent, the failure to fully implement flexible working arrangements) the Knowledge Exchange (KE) activities (workshops, networks, and policy briefings) will facilitate the sharing of good practice and the development of policies and guidelines designed to meet the needs of Inspectors, their families and the Police Service. Involving all the stakeholders in this process, including superintendents, ACPO, the Home Office, and the new PCCs, will create a 'common recognition' of the problems (based on our research evidence) and 'shared ownership' of any proposed solutions.

A novel feature of our approach will be to focus on the organisational and collective (cultural) causes of stress rather than the episodic and individual (psychological) causes. Although the Police Service recognises stress caused at the extreme end of policing (e.g. violent confrontations or serious road traffic accidents) the everyday organisational stress caused by long hours, a heavy workload and ever increasing responsibility is obscured in a bureaucratic (target driven) Police Service characterised by a lack of resilience and a (macho) culture that prizes speed, strength and capability. By addressing these deeper organisational causes of ill-health the KE activities are expected to have a more lasting impact on the Inspecting Ranks and the Police Service. Agreed solutions to the problems created by long working hours will also help policy-makers (most notably the Home Office) 'square the circle' of promoting employee health and equality, fighting crime, and maintaining service standards with a diminishing budget.

While the project has the potential to inform policy and practice in the other emergency services, our focus on the Inspecting Ranks will also inform current research on middle management and professional groups where questions of work-life balance (WLB) are of growing concern. Our planned academic publications will address key debates around WLB, the 'lumpiness' of labour demand for professional workers, the role of (professional) identity and the apparent intractability of the macho work culture, with a particular focus on the impact on women officers in the Police Service.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>52280</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Cancer Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Police Federation</gtr:description><gtr:id>86188110-2D52-42FC-A117-394FC3E8EBAC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lancashire report 2014.

Participants included Sergeants (who are managed by Inspectors) and Superintendents who manage Inspectors. The Association of Chief Officers (ACPO) and Police and Crime Commissioners were each represented during the programme as were police civilian staff in Occupational Health, Health and Safety and Human Resources. The Centre piece of each Regional Workshop was the Force Report which compared Force-level working hours, wellbeing statistics and quotations with those at the national level and highlighted force-specific differences and policy issues to take forward in local negotiations. Using a comparative approach, Dr Wass presented key points from the Force reports including Freedom of Information request responses and statistics on hours and wellbeing. Each workshop included an expert contribution on the Working Time Regulation from an Employment Lawyer and the latest developments and findings in Sleep research in relation to the consequences of poor sleep and consequent fatigue for performance at work. Professor Turnbull facilitated a discussion of how the Force Reports and expert contributions might form the basis of negotiations over workload. Each presentation was captured in a set of slides, summary documents and Policy Briefings and, together with Force Reports, disseminated beyond workshop participants using the Police Federation website at http://www.polfed.org/ranks/1318.aspx.

The concept of Evidence-based representation emerged and was actively developed. The term covers the conscious use of findings of robust social science research to protect and promote the interests of Inspectors in local (Force-based) negotiations with HR managers and senior officers (ACPO). In relation to the Force Reports as evidence, this comprises the presentation of findings on working hours and wellbeing that can be explained and defended by Inspectors Branch Board representatives and used to support a position in local negotiations with managers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.polfed.org/ranks/1318.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at National Inspectors Forum (2016) Harrogate</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4145DF27-EF72-42A8-B31E-C391509B3691</gtr:id><gtr:impact>50 Federation reps attended the national meeting in Harrogate.

Participation on the panel reinforces links between the wider context of policing under austerity and the difficulties experienced by individual officers in managing an increasing workload. Panel discussion at this level reminds managers that the increasing requirements and expectations placed on Inspectors to overwork has consequences for individual wellbeing and quality of service.


Panel discussion with national distribution increases the profile of Time for Justice and the use which is being made of the findings.

Evidence-based negotiations with senior managers. Many Inspectors' Branch Boards (IBBs) have used Force Reports as part of their 'Evidence-based negotiations' over working-time, workload, hours' recording and Working Time Agreements (WTAs). As examples, Staffordshire used its Force Report to encourage inspectors to record their hours, the Force to monitor recorded hours and to raise hours-related equality issues. In Sussex, Force Reports were used to support a case for monthly hours' monitoring reports. The Force Report for Scotland was instrumental in the negotiation of new WTAs (specifically in relation to 'on-call' working and working arrangements in the custody division) and in the establishment of a Working-time Working Group (Police Scotland, Scottish Police Authority, Scottish Police Federation).

It was prompted by (i) the results of a Freedom of Information request for Forces to supply Inspectors' hours of work during the survey week in which the majority of Forces were unable to comply with this (and thus with the WTR's requirement to monitor hours of work) and (ii) contribution of the Employment Lawyer to the Regional Workshops covering the regulation of Inspectors' hours of work and remedies open to Inspectors in case of breach (http://www.polfed.org/documents/P0415WTR_15042013.pdf).

3. Recording of hours. Regional Workshops and Force Reports raised the profile of overworking and under-recording of hours and also provided the technical capacity to accurately record actual hours of work, using the mobile phone App developed under the KEO project. 

4. Network of support for on-going KE between researchers and IBBs, between IBBs, and between IBBs and the centre (Inspectors Central Committee (ICC)). Investigators have provided training and assistance to IBB Secretaries in administering follow-up surveys in three constabularies (Lancashire, South Yorkshire and Staffordshire) and the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) using an annual subscription to an online survey provider funded by the KEO project. Lancashire IBB presented survey findings and their use in workload negotiations at a national meeting of IBB Chairs and Secretaries (Stratford-upon-Avon, October 2015). The ICC is funding follow-up surveys in ten further Forces in 2015. These surveys will cover wellbeing which is a current focus for Force HR initiatives. 

5. Equality Sub-committee of the Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW) invitation to study the equality impact of a long hours' culture including an analysis of Employment Tribunals in hours-related claims supported by the PFEW. 

6. Confidence to confide and to challenge long hours. Through debate and discussion, long hours and difficulties in managing them are increasingly seen as a common and shared problem giving Inspectors the confidence to confide in colleagues and to challenge management requests to overwork. One of the key findings of Time for Justice was the under-recording of concerns over long working hours in an institutional culture characterised by hegemonic masculinity and overwork. In subsequent surveys, both our own (follow-up survey in South Yorkshire in March 2013 and in Lancashire April 2014) and those of others (see Hogget et al 2014), a greater proportion are reporting hours' related ill-health and reporting it within the organisation. 

7. Attention of Chief Constables. In a 'command and control' organisation such as the Police Service, change in policy and culture demands the attention of Chief Constables and initiatives that travel 'from the top down'. Using evidence uncovered at the KEO Regional Workshops, the ICC initiated a direct dialogue with Chief Constables over hours recording under the Working Time Regulation (WTR), the use of Daily Management Meetings (DMMs) and the long hours culture in policing. Following the first Regional Workshop (14th April 2013), the ICC presentation to the Chief Constables Council (23rd April 2013) covered hours of work, recording hours of work and potential breaches of the WTR by Forces (revealed in Freedom of Information request responses). Each Chief Constable was presented with concrete (visual) evidence of the failings of the Duty Management System (DMS) in recording hours of work alongside the nature and extent of long hours worked by its Inspectors. This was followed up with correspondence (starting on 26th June 2013) between Sir Hugh Orde, President of ACPO, Chief Constables and the ICC (https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/working_time_regulations_and_ins?unfold=1#incoming-394029). Further, a letter from the General Secretary of the ICC (9th December 2013) was sent to Chief Constables describing DMM as a time-consuming and stressful job task with very uncertain operational benefits (http://www.polfed.org/documents/DMM_letter.pdf). Following these interventions, several Forces sent ACPO representatives to subsequent Regional Workshops. Subsequently, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police acknowledged a long hours' culture in his Force (Police Oracle 9.13.13) and the Chief Constable of Derbyshire Police encouraged officers to seek help when they feel stressed at work (Police Oracle 28.11.13).

8. Overworking in the next rank up. Inspectors' immediate line managers (Superintendents) face similar problems in respect of working time and representatives from this rank attended several Regional Workshops. In addition, the Superintendents' Association of England &amp;amp; Wales incorporated many of the survey questions used in the Time for Justice and subsequent (Force-specific) surveys of Inspectors in their own surveys of Superintendents' working time and wellbeing.

9. Overworking outside policing. Long hours of work and the poor monitoring of hours of work are not confined to the police service. The mobile phone App is available to anyone with a smart phone and can be downloaded from the PFEW website. It was advertised at the Cardiff University Research Fair May 2014 and in a Cardiff University wellbeing blog in November 2014 (http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/staffwellbeing/2014/11/20/self-care-week-addressing-overwork-through-the-recording-of-working-hours/).

10. Meeting challenges. Throughout the project the research partners encouraged Inspectors to more systematically record their working time, ideally via the Force DMS as well as the mobile phone App. Follow-up surveys have revealed rather 'mixed' success (significant variation across individuals and Forces). Inspectors were encouraged to more openly discuss workload and wellbeing concerns with their line managers (senior officers) and Force HR managers. All our evidence indicates a greater willingness to do this, but an on-going reluctance to actually 'refuse' to work hours considered to be 'excessive' and a potential risk to personal wellbeing and ability to perform the job (e.g. poor decision-making when overly tired on the job). The outstanding challenge is to progress these concerns further up the hierarchy. To date, we have met with a 'mixed' response from ACPO which has been slow to either monitor hours of work or change working time arrangements. In contrast, Force HR managers have been keen to engage with the research, with several senior HR managers attending Regional Workshops and two Forces (Dorset and Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall) including sharing information on their wellbeing programmes as examples of 'best practice' during the course of the KEO project. 

11. Changing Inspectors' behaviour. New DMS were introduced in 2014 as a consequence of the Winsor Report (unsocial hours' payments) and provided improvements to the flexibly and friendliness of the DMS in the monitoring of hours of work. Force-based follow-up surveys suggest that the solution to the better management of working time and the protection and promotion of Inspectors' wellbeing requires more than a 'technical fix' - many Inspectors continue to under-record their working time and remain reluctant to refuse to work what they consider to be 'excessive' working hours.

The principle objective of this Knowledge Exchange (KE) activity was to explore, agree and disseminate meaningful and proactive steps towards rectifying the problems of long (and excessive) working hours amongst Inspectors in the Police Service. Our KEO partners were the Inspectors Central Committee (ICC) of the Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW) and the Scottish Police Federation (SPF). The objective has been achieved through a series of forty-four Force Reports and ten Regional Workshops (one for each of the nine Regions of the PFEW and a single workshop for the recently combined Police Scotland), the purpose of which was to promote engagement with and impact from a detailed 85-page Research Report (Turnbull and Wass 2012) Time for Justice: Long Working hours and the Wellbeing of Police Inspectors (http://library.college.police.uk/docs/Time-for-Justice-report-2012.pdf) a representative survey of the Inspecting Ranks in England, Scotland and Wales that provided a compelling evidence-base on the extent and underlying causes of long hours of work and work-related ill- health.

2. Overworking and under-recording. Through the KE activities we uncovered dysfunctional Duty Management Systems (DMS) that (typically) roster Inspectors' on a 40-hour working week but fail to accurately record actual working time. As a result, almost every Force in the country is non-compliant with the Working Time Regulations (WTR) in respect of its duty to accurately record working time and ensure that Inspectors do not work more than 48 hours per week over a 17-week rolling period. Inspectors themselves fail to accurately record their working time, partly because DMS are not 'user-friendly' and will not easily record 'out of hours' working time but also because of the (macho) 'can do' work attitude that pervades the organisation. 

3. Overworking and wellbeing. As Inspectors recognise and report, doing 'more with less' comes with a significant risk to their wellbeing, the effectiveness of their decision-making at work, and consequently the quality of service provided by the Police Service to citizens and communities. Expert contribution from Professor Bryan Vila described experiments from his laboratory in Washington State University in which tired and overworked police officers are shown to be less responsive when driving, less accurate when shooting and less able to make sound judgments in the kind of tense, difficult and conflictual situations routinely encountered at work (http://www.polfed.org/documents/vila_Present_Polfed_20130415.pdf). 

4. Evidence-based representation. In understanding the evidence and its potential use in negotiations with senior managers to secure a more effective management of working time, the concept of 'evidence-based representation' emerged and was actively developed. The term covers the conscious use of findings of robust social science research to protect and promote the interests of Inspectors in local (Force-based) negotiations with HR managers and senior officers (ACPO). There are both substantive and procedural elements to this activity. The substantive element is simply the presentation of robust evidence that can be defended by Inspectors' Branch Board reps in local negotiations over working time and wellbeing. The procedural element is about changing the way the ICC supports Inspectors Branch Board (IBB) reps in their local (Force-based) negotiations (i.e. how to collect, analyse and most effectively present research evidence).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Local follow-up surveys of workload and wellbeing. The Regional Workshops demonstrated to IBB reps how research evidence is collected, analysed and presented, combining statistical (quantitative) evidence with a compelling narrative informed by (qualitative) data collected from 'open text' responses to survey questions, focus group data and information from one-to-one interviews with key respondents. Taking this approach forward, IBBs were invited to conduct their own follow-up surveys with support from the investigators in respect of survey design and adaptation to local (Force) circumstances (e.g. specific shift patterns, job categories, etc.), with initial data analysis undertaken by the investigators, detailed discussion of the 'raw results' with IBB reps, and then a 'joint report-writing' process tailored to the needs of the negotiating team and focused on the key concerns of the Inspecting ranks in the Force in question. Our 'pilot study' of this follow-up survey involved the IBB for Lancashire. The IBB reps from Lancashire presented the results of both the survey and their negotiations with their Chief Constable at the national IBB Chairs and General Secretaries meeting (Stratford-upon-Avon, October 2014), with additional input at the meeting from Dr Wass. Lancashire Constabulary have asked the IBB to survey the workload of the inspecting ranks on an annual basis and the ICC has agreed to support additional surveys (one in each of the nine regions of the PFEW). Lancashire IBB negotiated a six-point well-being plan on basis of survey evidence. Impact of plan to be monitored annually with follow-up surveys. 
Staffordshire IBB presented survey findings to local senior leadership team from where an Excessive Hours Working Group was established under leadership of DCC. 
PFEW and SPF funded follow-on surveys in ten Forces in 2015 and 2016. ESRC/IAA funds secondments to each branch to co-produce material for impact. 

2. New surveys on key issues. This process of evidence-based representation has been taken a stage further by the IBB for the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), where an 'independent' study of part-time inspectors (working time, wellbeing, flexible working arrangements) was undertaken with only 'guidance' from the Cardiff team (as opposed to 'joint research'). Both the data collection/analysis and report-writing closely followed the 'blueprint' established under the KEO project and the study of part-time working in the MPS has informed the latest negotiation on flexible working and the payment of hours worked above the agreed part-time hours and below the 40 hour rostered week for full-time Inspectors.

3. From local to national. Following the Time for Justice research project and the subsequent KEO, representatives from the Inspecting ranks have moved to occupy key positions (national Chair) in the PFEW. While most of our work during the KEO project involved local (IBB) Federation reps, interest in the principles of evidence-based representation has since followed through to the national level. Evidence-based representation is particularly relevant given that a new national negotiating machinery is to replace the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) in July 2015. The PFEW was subject to internal review in the Autumn of 2013. The resulting 'Normington Report' highlighted the need for better use of evidence in order to improve the knowledge-base, accountability and negotiating credentials of the Federation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>656A44DC-2C2B-44DD-9F14-B86B8F599126</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.polfed.org/ranks/1318.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Inspectors Working Time agenda item of The strategic Resourcing Board at Lancashire Police.
