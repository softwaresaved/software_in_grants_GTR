CLoud</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M020576/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Cloud is an emerging technology that offers democratic access to computing power, data storage, software and services often for a small pay-per-use cost. Like any new technology the Cloud has potential for great good, but in the wrong hands can facilitate criminal activity. Within this project we seek to understand the different types of crime that can happen in the Cloud, build systems that will allow the detection of this criminal behaviour and enable the use of digital evidence to lead to successful prosecution of Cloud crime perpetrators.

In order to achieve this goal we are forming a truly inter-disciplinary research centre leveraging the strengths of both Durham and Newcastle Universities. Bringing together the strengths of Durham in criminology, law and ethics along with the strengths of Newcastle in the areas of (computer) systems security, artificial intelligence, data mining and psychology. We are convinced that Cloud crime can only be detected and tackled by such a truly inter-disciplinary centre. Such a centre will actively create the research foundations for successful computational methods in crime detection combined with good user engagement, generating research that can cross disciplines and directly inform public policy, police and prosecution practices and transform public understanding of Cloud crime. 

This will involve development of a true understanding of what crime can be conducted on the Cloud. Facilitated through the development of cloud crime scripts, defining the activities of a criminal act, which will aid discussion between the different disciplines and must be presentable in a format understandable by our key stakeholders: Cloud providers/users/developers, law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system.

The detection of criminal activity in the cloud requires the integration of heterogeneous sensors, aggregation and analysis techniques, where we draw upon existing expertise in cloud security assurance (Gross, IBM), host monitoring and anomaly detection Ben-ware (McGough, Wall, DSTL), and fuzzy search on unstructured data, intrusion detection and analysis (Nifty, Yan). We propose combining the systems expertise with complementary techniques in artificial intelligence, including data mining (McGough), behaviour machine learning, anomaly detection (Ploetz) and hierarchical machine learning and knowledge extraction (Bacardit).

This portfolio gives raise to multiple means to derive and combine intelligence, present bespoke visualizations, situational awareness, grammar or language generation for the cloud crime scripts. Thus allowing the centre to tailor the intelligence, and its presentation, to a given stakeholders needs. We propose using additional human computation and crowd sourcing techniques to reduce the number of situations where the system incorrectly identifies a criminal act. The use of human computation and crowd sourcing will also allow us to hone the machine learning system, developing a suite of hybrid techniques that, together, will improve cloud crime detection but will frame the results in such a way as to support subsequent crown prosecution processes. This latter achievement will require expertise in the disciplines of criminology, forensic sciences, law and ethics and will require collaboration with police forces throughout the UK and Action Fraud. 

In addition we will bring in relevant work around (i) forensic psychology (Oxburgh) that will deliver case-sensitive interview and investigative procedures for witnesses, victims and investigators; (ii) prosecution procedures that will ensure that evidence going to court is not compromised by intelligence gathering methodologies and (iii) prevention of underreporting of Cloud crime and improvement of public understanding and confidence.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is accepted that the use of the Cloud is expanding at an exceptional rate and the technology is developing very rapidly. The Centre is committed to not just keeping pace with the technical development but also to enable understanding of the issues behind the new areas of criminality in the cloud. The Centre will maximise the impact (in knowledge, societally and economically) of its activities for the UK and the region, following Newcastle University's dedication as civic university and the Centre for Cybercrime and Computer Security (CCCS) theme 'Protecting Society's Fabric'. Impact from the activities will fall in the broad areas below:

1. Knowledge on cloud crime and cybercrime. 
Outputs from Work Packages (WP) 1 and 5 will enable greater understanding of the environment and criminal use of the Cloud. Through our stakeholder network this will expand knowledge, assets and capacities for all stakeholders involved, be it Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) - police forces etc., cloud providers, victim organizations, or government. This includes:

- Methodological knowledge in terms of guidelines and best practices affecting policy 
- Action plans to exercise upon such as investigative interview scripts
- Recommendations for policing and governance for policy and operational development.

Output from WP 2 will enable the use of novel system architectures to gain real time situational awareness, including real-time detection and simulation thereby delivering intelligence on the criminal activity. This will also offer the opportunity of use by LEAs for better approaches to digital forensics and detection. 

2. People and UK Cyber Security Experts.
Expansion of the knowledge base understanding and expertise by the Centre are critical aspects of WP 2, 4 and 6. By the research of the centre and through the engagement strategy there will be effective knowledge transfer to stakeholders in addition all researchers will have the environment to become experts of the fields of cloud computing and cloud crime. The Centre Draws together experts from Durham and Newcastle forming a hub of cybercrime and security research in the North East that is second to none. Additional impacts include:

- PhD students, in particular with the EPSRC DTCs Cloud Computing for Big Data and Digital Civics in collaboration and supervised by investigators, additional PhDs contributed by the institutions, and GCHQ/ACE-CSR PhDs aligned with the centre topics.
LEAs, police forces and SME cloud developers will both have access to experts and will themselves have the opportunity to become experts in cloud and cyber crime understanding for policing and governance.

3. Economics.
The north East already has a significant ICT and digital economy (e.g. Sunderland Software city, Dyanamo NE, Cobalt Data park) the centre will provide an additional growth impulse to these initiatives. Drawing on a fabric of SMEs already present and connected to the universities and centres. (WP6)
Amplifying government and council investments from Newcastle and Sunderland council, as well as the universities, e.g. Science Central in Newcastle, or the council/government co-funded Newcastle cloud centre.
WPs 2-6 will create a critical mass for cloud security research aligned with the G-cloud vision exercised in the Northeast.

4. Society.
Use of the Cloud will increase dramatically in the future; the development of policies, detection methods, understanding can be used a source of new policy development and discussion. In particular the Centre will improve public confidence as pursued in the user engagement strategy (WP5, 6) and drive down under-reporting as discussed with Northumbria police.
Feedback with end-users from both virtual real communications how cloud crime and their harm is taken care of and a better understanding of the criminal environment will lead to higher detection rates and confidence in the LEAs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2027645</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Northumbria Police</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Northumbria Police</gtr:description><gtr:id>12F7064A-D954-41CA-AC80-A53BA8A4C790</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Initial meetings towards collaboration agreement.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Briefing on police needs on data analysis and reporting.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Scoping analysis of police (ActionFraud) data to detect patterns in police data, especially towards problem profiles or causality in case files.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)</gtr:department><gtr:description>GCHQ</gtr:description><gtr:id>DAC7A442-E623-4BCE-8884-466996BA6C91</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Secure computing facility for primarily impacting cloud crime research at first.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>GCHQ supported the creation of a secure environment, including expertise on design and accreditation.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We establish the capability to run analyses for research projects, especially with a machine-learning methodology, on data with protective marking secret.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Metropolitan Police Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cloud crime with MET</gtr:description><gtr:id>E67CB6A9-88B2-49D4-94CE-7AF8A6F281A8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is once commencing.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Initial agreement on joint efforts.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Initial agreement on joint efforts.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Crime Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cloud crime with NCA</gtr:description><gtr:id>333923FC-48E0-4A7A-A701-CCBEF8808B99</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcomes of initial conversations have been captured in a results paper governed by David Wall.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Offering understanding of the national strategy to address cyber crime and cloud crime.
