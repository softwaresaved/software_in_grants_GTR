A key attribute that sets apart powerful and powerless people in social settings is their capacity to act. Powerful individuals are quicker to both set and implement goals, and appear more overt, willing and direct in their actions. By contrast, powerless people are more deliberative, see less opportunity for action, and engage in action more passively. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the cognitive processes that underlie these behavioural differences. In principle, there are at least two ways in which heightened power could facilitate action; (1) it could sharpen the ability to detect and perceive action cues in the environment, and (2) it could directly prime action processes related to the selection and execution of physical responses. The current study will explore these possibilities by first priming experimental participants to feel either powerful or powerless, and then measuring their performance on basic cognitive tasks that selectively tap different stages of the perceptual-motor cycle. The intended outcome will be to explain how, at a cognitive level, power affects action orientation, and more broadly, to generate new links between social and cognitive phenomena.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81765</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Perceptual tuning: Lack of power enhances visual discrimination.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>94E7AB5E-AA90-47EC-8010-53F0106809B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented at the 16th General Meeting of the European Association of Social Psychology, Stockholm, Sweden.

(1938, p10.). The key to human nature that Marx found in wealth and Freud found in sexual desire, Russell found in power. Social power is, he contends, man's ultimate goal and, in its many guises, is the single most important element in the development of any society. The proposed study sought to develop our understanding of how social power (that is, the ability to control other people?s outcomes) influences human behaviour. In social contexts, powerful individuals tend to act more quickly than their powerless counterparts, setting and acting on goals more easily, using cognitive short-cuts to reach decisions when possible, and spending less time focusing on irrelevant information. In the present study, we examined whether these social tendencies are reflected in how powerful and powerless individuals carry out more elemental tasks concerned with perceptual discrimination and motor response. By conducting tasks of this nature it is possible to identify specific cognitive processes that are impacted by power, in turn providing a deeper insight into how and why social power affects human behaviour.
To assess the effects of social power on cognition, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments in which participants were first asked to recall a previous event in which they either felt powerful or powerless. We then asked them to perform computerised experiments that involved judgments about various shapes and patterns appearing on the screen, while varying the perceptual and response demands of the task. In some experiments we asked participants to discriminate between objects of different colour, size, texture, location or function, while in others we asked them to respond in different ways; by pressing buttons, pointing, using a pen or mimicking the hand movement of another. There were three important results. 
First, individuals who had been primed to feel powerful were no quicker or accurate at performing any of the tasks than those who were powerless. This result was surprising because, as intimated above, powerful individuals tend to be faster at setting and acting on goals during more complex tasks involving social judgment and interaction. We had therefore anticipated that these tendencies would be apparent in simple cognitive tasks that retain the core elements of these social tasks ? attention to task relevant information and the subsequent compilation of a motor response. The failure to find a difference therefore implies that power does not promote action through influencing basic sensori-motor processing, and rather interacts with higher-level factors that perhaps manifest when individuals become directly subject to the evaluations and expectations of others.
Second, we found that powerless participants actually out-performed their powerful counterparts when making perceptual discriminations; powerless participants were faster and more accurate at deciding whether two objects had the same colour, shape or texture, and required fewer eye movements to make the decision. Other studies have shown that powerless participants struggle when confronted with more complex cognitive demands involving repeatedly switching between tasks or ignoring irrelevant information, so the finding not only uncovers a new link between powerlessness and visual perception but also highlights a boundary condition that limits the scope of its deleterious effects.
Third, we found that priming individuals to feel powerless induced a slight leftward bias in their ability to judge the midpoint of horizontal lines. By contrast, powerful participants showed no deviation from centre. Spatial biases in midpoint estimation are taken to indicate that one side of the brain is more active than the other. In this case, a leftward bias in the powerless sample implies that the right side of the brain was more strongly activated than the left side. Very little research has examined the biological basis of social power, and the intriguing implication is that processes that are preferentially lateralised to the right side, such as face recognition, may be enhanced when an individual feels powerless. For ethical reasons, it would of course be difficult to apply such a manipulation within a neuro-rehabilitative context.
In summary, these results have furthered our understanding of how an individual?s sense of power affects his/her ability to carry out basic cognitive tasks. On one hand, our experiments show conditions in which increased power has little effect on how an individual discriminates between or manually responds to simple visual stimuli. On the other hand, they show conditions in which reduced power sharpens perceptual discrimination and induces a slight spatial bias in the allocation of attention. From a social psychological perspective, we must now therefore embrace the fact that powerless frames of mind not only, as traditionally believed, impair task performance, but also facilitate it. From a cognitive psychological perspective, our data have uncovered a novel feature of the social environment that needs to be incorporated into models of perceptual function, and from a practical perspective, highlight the need for perceptual studies to control for this confounding factor.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Social neuroscience is an inter-disciplinary venture aimed at mapping the cognitive and biological bases of social behaviour.
