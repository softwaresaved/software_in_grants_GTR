Because of its history of inter-communal strife, NI is one of the most studied societies in the world. More recently, it has become an exemplar for conflict resolution. Consequently, it is important to understand social, economic, and demographic processes in NI through the late 20th Century and early 21st Century. However, in comparison, with other UK longitudinal studies, the NILS is weaker in backward data linkages.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The proposal rationale is thus for a link to the 1991 Census. Such a linkage will allow analyses of a crucial period of rapid change in Northern Ireland (from 1991 to 2011) by linking the NILS to three Censuses. This longer perspective is of special importance given the nature if the 'Peace Process' and the implementation and monitoring of policy interventions in fair employment and community relations as well as economic restructuring. Opportunities to add other historical administrative data to the NILS will also be scoped if possible. The outcome of the project will be a larger documented NILS dataset and a methodological report on the data linkage.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The full 1991 Link will be incorporated into existing NILS-RSU plans for impact and will help to expand and to strengthen these. There has always been a strong emphasis on policy implications of NILS research and outreach and dissemination strategies are a major part of any research proposal. The NILS Research Approvals Group (RAG) takes full account of these aspects when assessing all applications. This recognises the NI Executive as a source of NILS funding (they also support an RSU support officer) and this ensures an emphasis on policy and the NILS relationship with government. 

Where possible, projects are planned with impact for policymakers and the public in mind, and examples include: suicide in NI; religion and health outcomes (both O'Reilly &amp;amp; Rosato); breast screening (Kinnear et al); fertility (McGregor &amp;amp; McKee); dental activity (Telford et al); entry to care-homes (McCann et al); antibiotic prescribing patterns (Johnston &amp;amp; Rosato); accuracy of address information from the healthcare system (Barr &amp;amp; Shuttleworth); and migration and residential segregation (Shuttleworth, Barr &amp;amp; Gould). Based on already published research the RSU routinely produces summary Research Briefs, helping maintain the relationship with government. The forthcoming challenge is to deepen this impact by increasing the range and quality of NILS projects and reaching out to new audiences. The 1991 Link will help this in two ways.

Firstly, plans for a programme of research around the 2001-2011 Census Link which are being developed will be extended backwards to 1991 to engage broadly with the theme of 'Northern Ireland in Transition' over the whole period. As part of this, it is planned (with support from funders) to engage with experienced and early-career researchers to produce a landmark edited book on 'NI in Transition'. This will generate impact, broaden the user base, provide a forum for young-researcher interchange, and focus current work with future research in a single reference volume. 

Secondly, the 1991 Full Link will be used a basis to develop a programme of research with government and other researchers focussing on the transition out of conflict (in divided societies). This is ambitious and NILS involvement in such an enterprise is predicated on this link. The development of such ideas will involve cooperation with the Northern Ireland Equality Commission, the Community Relations Council, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, and the Office of the First and Deputy First Ministers. It is planned that such a research programme could target UK and non-UK researchers with a track record of research in conflict studies, especially with a Northern Ireland focus, with approaches to foster research projects. 

Finally, the 1991 Full Link will be used to increase the impact of the NILS by helping to make a case for further data linkage. The addition of data from the 1990s with its longer-term perspective might, for instance, help neighbourhood effects and exposure to environment to be better specified and thus help to make a stronger case for linking current administrative data to the NILS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>500817</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NILS Promotion - BSPS</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>84C16D0F-1D16-4D35-B2DD-7571DFCA3B8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The NILS was promoted at the British Society for Population Studies (BSPS) conference in Leeds from 7th-9th September 2015.

The work reported in this document is not an orthodox research project but instead summarises the output of an ESRC-funded project to create linked Census data to enhance the research potential of the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS). Its genesis lies in the successful bid to secure funding for the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study Research Support Unit (NILS-RSU) from 2012 to 2017. In response to this, the Methods and Infrastructure Committee (MIC) of the ESRC suggested that a full link (rather than the then-existing partial link made using fuzzy matching of non-identifiable attributes such as postcode, gender and country of birth) to the 1991 Census should be made to extend the temporal depth of the NILS.

The proposal offers three clear benefits. Firstly, it places the NILS on a more closely-comparable basis to the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS) which begins with 1991 Census data linkage and the ONS LS in England &amp;amp; Wales which commenced in 1971. Secondly, it makes cross-UK analysis using the LSs possible from a common start date of 1991. Thirdly, it covers the 1990s - a decade which saw the start of the transition away from violence in Northern Ireland - and is therefore a period of interest to social and political scientists as well as other scholars. Finally, it increases the power of the NILS since, when the 2011 Census data are linked, it will include the three Censuses of 1991, 2001 and 2011 rather than just the two of 2001 and 2011 (or the 'two and a half' given the partial nature of the 1991 Link before the project). 

The objectives of the project reflect this context. The overall intention was to create a full and robust linkage of the 1991 Census to the NILS that was comparable to the SLS and the ONS LS but beyond this the other objectives were to:

1. Provide full documentation on the 1991 Census and the linkage process for the benefit of users.
2. Promote the benefits of the 1991 Link to existing academic and policy users.
3. Use the 1991 Link to attract more users to the NILS.
4. Exploit the benefits from the 1991 Link to encourage linkage from other sources.
5. Use the full run of NILS data, 1991-2011, to promote research across the UK using the LSs for this time period.

The next section of this key findings report reviews how far these objectives were met. Following this, the project's most significant achievements are discussed, before concluding comments on how the work may be taken forward and developed are made.

To what extent were the objectives met?
Nearly all the objectives were met to some extent, others were met in full, and yet others were exceeded. The brief account below justifies this statement. The success of the overall objective to create a full and robust linkage of the NILS to the 1991 Census comparable to the ONS LS and the SLS is documented in NILS Working Paper 5.0 (http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/NILSResearchSupportUnit/GuidesResources/FurtherReading/). The headline statistics from this show that 78.5% of 2001 NILS members were identified in the 1991 Census compared with 75.6% in the SLS and 77.6% in the ONS LS, and that the NILS population with a 1991 Census link closely match the age and geographical distributions of the Northern Ireland population enumerated in the 1991 Census. The 1991 Link was completed by the planned date of September 2014 with 2001 occupation data being backcoded to SOC90. 

The specific objectives set out above will now be discussed in turn. That to provide full documentation on the 1991 Census and the linkage process for the benefit of users has been met with the development of the NILS Data Dictionary, (in coordination with the Census &amp;amp; Administrative data LongitudinaL Studies Hub (CALLS-Hub)), and the provision of Working Paper 5.0 by NISRA. A further objective was to promote the benefits of the 1991 Link to existing academic and policy users and this has been done at a variety of venues, most recently in July 2015 at the Understanding Society Conference held at the University of Essex. It was also hoped to use the 1991 Link to attract more users to the NILS. This has been met: to date, since the release of the 1991 Link, there are 5 current projects using the data, and other proposals which plan to use it. The objective to exploit the benefits from the 1991 Link to encourage linkage from other sources has been met partially through the additional linkage of registration data - see the next section on Significant Achievements. Finally, the objective to promote research across the UK using the LSs for this time period has not been realised yet in full given the time elapsed between the 1991 data release and the production of this report but it has been partially met by project proposals and ideas by postgraduate research students and others for cross-LS (and cross-UK) comparative analyses of topics like commuting, labour market transitions, and migration. 

The original objectives have, however, been substantially exceeded since within the project budget it has also been possible to complete a NILS link to the 1981 Census, link all deaths 1991-2001 to the 1991 Census to extend the Northern Ireland Mortality Study (NIMS), and to extend the linkage of birth registration data to the NILS from 1974-1991 - and thereby create a data series running from 1974 until the present.


Significant achievements
The significant achievements of the grant lie in the creation of additional Census and administrative datasets linked to the NILS. The first achievement is the production of a documented, robust and full linkage of the 1991 Census data to the NILS. Because of economies and technical improvements that were made by NISRA during the matching and linkage of the 1991 Census, there was a substantial underspend of the original budget. With the agreement of the ESRC it was possible to re-allocate this resource and use it for extra data linkage. The second major achievement was therefore to link the 1981 Census to the NILS. In effect, this has given two Censuses for the price of one and means that the NILS now extends from 1981 to 2011 over four Censuses and is second only to the ONS LS in its temporal scope. With the additional future linkage of the 2021 Census, the NILS will eventually cover five Censuses and this will greatly improve in its power to investigate events over the life course. The final significant achievement is the creation of a 1991 NIMS - a 100% linkage of all deaths in Northern Ireland 1991-2001 to the 1991 Census - and the linkage of birth registration data 1974-1991. These are important developments in studying mortality in three different decades (with the 2001 and 2011 NIMS) and also in extending the temporal reach of the NILS data. Using the births data from 1974, for instance, it will be possible to trace people with NILS birthdays from that year, pick them up in the 1981 Census, again in 1991, and then in 2001 and 2011, and to have background information on them that is collected via through the registration of vital events. It is therefore already possible to describe and measure the life events of NILS members from 1974 all the way to their current age of 40-41 years. This is highly important and if used imaginatively by researchers and the user community. Full documentation on the 1981 Link is being prepared by NISRA; NILS metadata have been created (and modified) to accommodate the 1981 Census Link, the 1991 NIMS and the historical births. 

Narrative impact
It is too soon for the creation of these data resources to have measurable impact. In some ways, the impact is in their existence and the provision of a NILS that now runs from 1981 to 2011 and, with the addition of registration data, from 1974 to 2015. This is a unique resource that will be available only in the NILS as it is impossible to link the 1981 and 1991 Censuses to other data. This resource will benefit Northern Ireland-based researchers and NILS users but also stakeholders far beyond Northern Ireland. There is already measurable emergent impact in the 5 projects that use (and others that seek to use) 1991 Census data. We have developed plans to maximise the impact and uptake of the new data resources that were funded by the ESRC. These include an Impact Workshop to be held in Belfast in October 2015 with invitees from Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK and, in 2016, a day-long event to celebrate the first ten years of the NILS where the full range of data available in the NILS will be discussed. This is in addition to the normal promotional work undertaken by the RSU in academic conferences such as Understanding Society, BSPS, and at the Society for Longitudinal and Lifecourse Studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are significant shortcomings with the 1981 Northern Ireland Census. They arise from the political context which saw the hunger strikes of Republican prisoners in the Spring of 1981 when the Census fieldwork was conducted. There was a campaign of non-cooperation with the Census (as an element of the British state) which led to non-response to the voluntary question on religion and, more seriously after the murder of a census enumerator, to under enumeration with missing households and people. It is assumed that these problems were concentrated in Irish nationalist and Republican areas. To develop the NILS further and to explore the value of the 1981 Census link it will therefore be necessary to estimate the size of these gaps and to use statistical methodologies to add missing data, whether on religion, or for missing people and households. The use of the NILS itself may help this process as will possibly missing data and population synthesis methods. We intend to explore these avenues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>19F5A94A-8919-48EA-8542-6AC1CD39F7E5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K005766/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1D32A760-9B88-43D4-8BDA-F0236A67470A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FFA3A6C9-532B-4B83-B6F7-AAF3E63D34F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Stats., Comp. &amp; Methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
