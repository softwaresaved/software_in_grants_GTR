&lt;p>The project builds this latest collaboration with the NCB, and Local Authorities.The ORIM framework is key to this Knowledge Exchange project, designed to engage a wider group of early childhood education practitioners. The question which informs this proposal is: 'How can practitioners in early years settings make meaningful use of the ORIM framework to support their work with parents to promote early literacy development'? This question will be addressed through two national conferences and three residential working groups of practitioners who will adapt&amp;nbsp; and use of the ORIM framework into their current family literacy practices (and where practitioners wish to, to new curriculum areas) and for use with families and a range of practitioners nation-wide. Following the workshops, materials will be collated and uploaded on to the REALonline website and practitioners will share their experiences and new developments of working with the ORIM framework at an end of project conference.&lt;br />&lt;br />Nutbrown, C.

We were interested in whether it was possible to adapt a tried-and-tested approach to family literacy (Nutbrown, et al. 2005), for effective use with imprisoned fathers.

Over a 5-month period, Pact workers and the Sheffield team planned and delivered a series of six jointly run full day workshops for male prisoners and six specifically designed literacy-oriented family visits for prisoners and their families. The focus in both workshops and family visits was early literacy development.

- Take up of the programme indicated that there was a need for such an initiative, with target numbers for participants being reached and a waiting list of men wishing to enrol;
- Participation ratings were strong, with sixty-nine men (93%) judged to participate at moderate to high levels on a 1-5 rating scale;
- The opportunity to see their children during the literacy-oriented family visit provided a strong motivation to enrol in the programme;
- Ideas about early literacy development were successfully shared with imprisoned fathers thus confirming that this element of an established and effective programme could be successfully adapted for prisoners.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>A collaborative an jointly funded project to pilot family literacy work in prisons was set up and run from November 2014 - July 2015.
FliP has provided staff and resources for the project and facilitated links with the Prisons and NOMS.

Overview and aims of the event
This event took the form of a 'literacy fun day' organised in the centre of the City of Sheffield to maximise public engagement. The indoor venue of the Sheffield Winter Garden was filled with literacy-oriented activities for parents, carers and their young children to do and enjoy together.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.real-online.group.shef.ac.uk/docs/ESRCfestival2NovFinalReport.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Early literacy work with families</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>84853D34-1287-46F3-8BD0-CF3D80A9DDB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At this conference 20 practitioners who have been working on our Early Literacy Work with Families project shared their experiences of working with the ORIM (Opportunities Recognition Interaction Models) Framework in their settings. They will present examples of their work and discuss how this has made a difference to children and families. They led a range of inspiring, practical workshops and share examples of their practice. Delegates will be able to attend two as part of the day. Professor Cathy Nutbrown, Professor of Education, Director for Research at The University of Sheffield, School of Education, also gave a keynote address on Early Literacy Work with Families.
