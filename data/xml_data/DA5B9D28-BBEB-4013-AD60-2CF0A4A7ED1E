These have been presented in greater detail in the grant holders' 2010 article in International Affairs (see below), and are reproduced here in a sharply abbreviated form:

1. The limitations of EU conflict resolution bodies: no shared understanding of what conflict management means and consequently an absence of an agreed strategy of conflict management across EU institutions; in a Union of 27 states, whose institutional set-up at present confines most foreign affairs decisions to unanimity in the Council, it is very difficult to reach common positions in cases where national interests and domestic sensitivities are involved; lack of an integrated EU foreign policy structure and service (prior to the Lisbon Treaty) and few if any officials with specialist training in conflict analysis.

2. The limitations of EU conflict resolution tools: despite a wide range of policy instruments for conflict management, an over-reliance on the principle of conditionality in its conflict management efforts, despite a mixed track record, exacerbated by a lack of institutional capacity to learn and transfer lessons across missions and institutions. 

3. Policy recommendations: given the identification of two key issues that have prevented the EU, to date, from living up to its aspirations to become a globally significant and impactful conflict manager - the lack of a permanent External Action Service and of a coherent and comprehensive conflict management strategy - we recommend two things:

a. That the new EAS aim to achieve a greater level of policy coherence through joined-up thinking between delegations on the ground and EU headquarters in Brussels, offering consistency and continuity of personnel over time, enhancing the role of the High Representative as the single voice of EU foreign policy, combining more effectively the range of policy tools available for conflict management, developing as yet non-existent capabilities and ensuring policy learning and establishment of best practice across the range of EU conflict management operations.

b. That the Union develop a proper conflict management strategy (going beyond the Commission's 2001 Communication on Conflict Prevention), resting on three pillars: a clear definition of EU interests in respect of a specific conflict and the context in which it occurs; an assessment of EU strengths and weaknesses in conflict management; and a feasible approach as to how these strengths can best be exploited and weaknesses either overcome or implied risks be mitigated. In addition, five substantive principles need to guide the EU's thinking about the process and outcome of its engagement in each individual conflict: primacy of negotiated solutions over imposed settlements; inclusiveness of negotiations; comprehensiveness of agreements; building broad coalitions of support for negotiated settlements; and need for long-term external assistance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The applicants have had direct input into UK and foreign policymaking by providing expert advice drawing on findings from this project to:
