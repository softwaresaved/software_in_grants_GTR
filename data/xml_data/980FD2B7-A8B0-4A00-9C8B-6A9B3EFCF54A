The matrix is composed of an intricate network of proteins which provides support for cells and the framework for tissues. The structure and organisation of most matrix proteins is poorly understood as they are very complicated, and it has proved a major challenge to understand their organisation. However, new approaches are now beginning to reveal important information on their assembly and structural organisation. Collagen VI microfibrils are important components of the extracellular matrix. These microfibrils have widespread distributions throughout the body where they form many linkages between cells and proteins. Mutations in collagen VI are linked to inherited muscular dystrophies, highlighting how important it is to study this molecule. The aims of this project are to investigate the structure and function of collagen VI microfibrils using the technique of cryo-Electron Microscopy. Many low contrast images of frozen hydrated microfibrils will be averaged to produce a 3D structure. Further details will be added by looking at the shape of small fragments of the collagen VI protein and mapping these onto the 3D structure of the microfibril. We will also look at larger assemblies of collagen VI in lattice-like structures, similar to those found in human tissues. The structure produced from these data will increase our understanding of the organisation of these complicated microfibrils.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Collagen VI is expressed in virtually all connective tissues, where it forms a complex and extensive microfibrillar network. The cell adhesive and extracellular matrix protein binding capabilities of collagen VI suggests it plays an important role in the interconnection between the cell and the structural scaffolding of the extracellular matrix. One critical tissue-specific role has been demonstrated by the detection of mutations in the collagen VI genes which give rise to heritable muscular dystrophies, highlighting its vital role in muscle anchorage. This study will determine the 3D organisation of hydrated collagen VI microfibrils using cryo-EM and single particle image analysis, which will generate the first model of these unique biopolymers in physiological hydrated state. Recombinant microfibrils will be generated to define the change in microfibril structure in different splice forms. Model building into the EM envelope will be aided using structures of contiguous blocks of A-domains determined by small angle x-ray solution scattering. The locations of these domains within the microfibril will be found using antibody epitope mapping. Contiguous blocks of A-domains, which equate to naturally occurring splice forms will be expressed, in order to determine the arrangement and configuration of domains upon splicing. Suprafibrillar assemblies will be reconstituted in vitro, in order to study higher order collagen VI assemblies. Electron tomography and image analysis will be utilised to study the 3D structure and organisation of higher order assemblies, to increase our understanding of collagen VI network formation in both healthy and diseased tissues. Refined alignment models produced from these data will increase our understanding of collagen VI molecular architecture. This fundamental biology of collagen VI is required for understanding its biological roles, tissue engineering applications, and defining the abnormal structures found in pathological tissues.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-11-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>213080</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Melbourne</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Murdoch Children's Research Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>Shireen Lamande, Melbourne</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A96D2FD-67B2-4CAB-8E30-95E2A1DDDB05</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collagen VI microfibril formation is abolished by an {alpha}2(VI) von Willebrand factor type A domain mutation in a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy.

Collagen VI microfibrils are important components of the extracellular matrix. These microfibrils have widespread distributions throughout the body where they form many linkages between cells and proteins. Mutations in collagen VI are linked to inherited muscular dystrophies, highlighting the importance of this molecule in tethering the extracellular matrix to cells.

The aims of this project were to investigate the structure and function of collagen VI microfibrils using the technique of Electron Microscopy with image analysis. We collected many thousand images of microfibrils extracted from tissue or cell cultures. These were imaged either using negative staining or frozen in a thin layer of ice. The microfibril images were computationally processed to calculate a 3D structure. The 3D structure highlighted flexibility in one region of collagen VI which we had previously suggested could be responsible for interacting with extracellular matrix molecules. In order to gain further details on this region we produced it in cells and looked at its shape and the interactions of this region of collagen VI with other extracellular matrix molecules found in human tissues. These data highlighted competition for binding between molecules and a role for metal-ions in changing the conformation of this region and its assembly. We mapped this region into the 3D structure of the microfibril, filling in a piece of this jigsaw. We also analysed the structure of collagen VI microfibrils isolated from cells taken from patients with Ullrich's congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). Although these microfibrils appeared to have a normal structure they were only able to form short microfibrils compared to normal individuals. The structures and information produced from these data has increase our understanding of the organisation of these complicated microfibrils, the effects of UCMD-causing mutations on microfibril assembly and has highlighted a novel role for metal-ions in stabilising collagen VI structure and assembly.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>An understanding of the structure and assembly of collagen VI and the defects seen in microfibrils from UCMD patients may lead to the development of therapeutics for this disease.
