The aims of this expedition were to investigate the volcanism and landslide history of the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc, by collecting a number of cores offshore Montserrat and Martinique. As a shipboard planktic foraminifera (single celled calcareous plankton) biostratigrapher (dating sediment cores using the appearances and disappearances of fossil plankton), Deborah Wall-Palmer (proposed PDRA) has access to these cores during the one year moratorium period. 

Until IODP Exp. 340, the longest continuous record (~250,000 years) of volcanic activity on Montserrat was a 5.75 m core collected to the south-west of the island in 2002, CAR-MON 2. This core revealed a more extensive and complete record of volcanic activity than that available in terrestrial cores. The longest continuous sediment record collected during Exp. 340 extends this record considerably. At 139.4 m in length, Hole U1396C records events back to 4.5 million years ago. The majority of this Hole will undergo stratigraphic analysis at low resolution, which will be carried out by other Exp. 340 scientists (Andrew Fraass, Mohammed Aljahdali). The upper 7 m section of this Hole is estimated to span 300,000 years and is comparable to the time period recovered in sediments for Holes U1394A/B (0 to 125 cm) and U1395B (0 to 30 cm). Holes U1394A/B and U1395B were collected close to Montserrat, in the main path of eruptive material from the Soufriere Hills volcano and contain a high resolution, but interrupted record of volcanic eruptions and landslides. 

Our proposed research is to provide a high resolution (every 2000 yrs) age framework across the upper ~300,000 year sections of these three cores. This will be achieved by collecting specimens of the planktic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber and analysing the stable oxygen isotope ratios contained within their calcium carbonate tests (shells). Oxygen isotope ratios provide information about the global ice volume and global climate, and the standard record can be identified world-wide. Correlation to this record can therefore be used to provide an age framework for sediments, which is more detailed than using the biostratigraphic range of species alone. Producing this age framework is essential for achieving the overall aims of Exp. 340 as it will be used, in collaboration with several other Exp. 340 scientists, to reconstruct the volcanic and landslide history of Montserrat. 

In addition to this, to ensure the conservative use of samples, some further work will be carried out on samples requested from the upper 7 m of Hole U1396C. This will assist in constructing the low resolution stable isotope and biostratigraphic framework for the remainder of this Hole. The majority of this work is being carried out by Andrew Fraass (University of Massachusetts) and Mohammed Aljahdali (Florida State University). We will analyse the upper 7 m of Hole U1396C, at low resolution, for stable oxygen isotopes of the benthic foraminifera Cibicidoides spp. and for planktic foraminifera datum species.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outcomes of this proposed research will be essential to achieving the scientific objectives and overall aims of IODP Exp. 340. The immediate beneficiaries from this proposed research will be the shipboard scientists who took part in IODP Expedition 340. This international group of scientists will benefit from the high resolution stratigraphic framework as it is essential to their own research, which will be based upon the same cores. Scientists carrying out Argon dating of ash layers will be particularly interested in using the data generated. The information generated will eventually be used as part of a collaborative study into reconstructing the volcanic and landslide history of the Lesser Antilles and identifying the time scales on which some of the larger volcanic events and landslides occurred. Since this research considerably extends all previous sedimentary records collected around Montserrat, it will also benefit other scientists who have studied the numerous shallow sediment cores previously collected. 

The longer term beneficiaries of this research will be those trying to understand the potential impacts of future large scale volcanic events and underwater landslides. As well as volcanologists, these may include scientists interested in geohazard management and modelling, as well as developers in tsunami warning and defences within the Lesser Antilles. This information will also have the potential to influence tourism in the Lesser Antilles, in particular safe practices, such as the positioning and construction of buildings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47483</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research funded by this grant allowed us to use high resolution geochemical techniques to investigate the age (stratigraphy) of deep-sea sediments of up to ~250 ka around the Island of Montserrat. Montserrat is an island in the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc and has a very active volcanic history, as well as a history of large-scale underwater landslides. Marine sediments record a more complete record of these events than the deposits on land, therefore, studying these sediments can help us to understand the history and timings of volcanic and underwater landslide events in this area. We can then look for links between volcanic events and other factors, such as the potentially tsunamigenic underwater landslides and environmental changes, such as changes in sea level. This can help us to predict hazards and to educate the residents of such islands. The stratigraphy investigated during this project will be used by many other scientists who continue to study the history of this area.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have been and will be used by others working on the volcanic history of the Lesser Antilles. This includes dating volcanic and landslide events in newly collected sediment cores and mapping on-land deposits.
