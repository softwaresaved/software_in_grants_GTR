1. The first level beneficiaries of this project are the head teacher and senior leaders in the Secondary Academy and the head teachers of the seven schools in the Primary Teaching School Alliance. 

2. The broader, second level audience are leaders of schools serving socio-economically disadvantaged urban communities in the East Midlands region and beyond. 

3. The third level audience are those who make and influence national policy and practice in improving schools in disadvantaged urban settings, including the Department for Education, the National College for School Leadership, the National Association of Headteachers. 

4. The fourth level audience are academics and educational researchers who will learn about the processes of working with schools in networks of knowledge exchange and transfer in order to apply and maximise the impact of their work in the context of use (See the Case for Support for more detail). 
 
The project will generate new understandings about effective leadership strategies for learning and capacity building in primary and secondary academies and schools, and through these, have potentially positive benefits for the above beneficiaries in the following ways:

i) For head teachers and senior leaders involved in the project in terms of enhancing their understanding and practice of leadership for learning;

ii) For leaders of schools serving socio-economically deprived communities in terms of increasing their knowledge of applied leadership practices and skills through which they can build and develop collective capacity in ways which will result in more effective teaching and learning and close attainment gaps;

iii) For government officials and non-government public bodies and quangos in terms of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of current models of and strategies for raising standards in schools in disadvantaged communities;

iv) For academics in terms of adding a new dimension to current understandings of and ways of designing applied, user-led research into the ways in which schools develop and foster leadership for learning

To ensure access and increase the likelihood of beneficial impacts we plan to disseminate outcomes and outputs of the projects widely to different educational stakeholders: 

i) to school leaders and head teachers in the participating Primary Teaching School Alliance and Secondary Academy via face to face workshops, support for their collaborative inquiries, the creation of web-based interactive workspace and bespoke leadership training materials for participating schools;

ii) to leaders of other schools and government officials and non-government public bodies through the development of a public facing website as an open platform for leadership development, a regional conference on leadership for learning, and the creation of a 'School-University Knowledge Transfer and Exchange Network' to enable sustained dialogue amongst practitioners themselves and between practitioners, academics and policy makers;

iii) to the academic community via publications in international and national refereed journals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45667</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research has impacted on both the user and academic community through a combination of actions:

User community 

1. An invitational national end-of-project dissemination event was held. The event was designed to share evidence of the impact of the project on the headteachers and staff of the participant schools, through presentations and discussion of the issues of knowledge exchange between universities and schools. This brought together 50 school and system leaders and representatives from Teaching School Alliances across the country. 
2. The interactive outward facing website was set up for the project. This publically accessible website contains video interviews with the participant headteachers and other school leaders, materials and resources used during the project, and the group and individual school posters concerning impact that were prepared for the conference.
3. The pathway that has the most effective, direct impact on the practice and performance of schools has been through working closely with school leaders to design, implement and evaluate research informed school-led, sustained professional development. This work has continued over the year since the project ended. For example:
a) In order to embed the culture of a research-rich school, one school has developed a 'Research Corner' in its staffroom led by an Assistant Headteacher with formal responsibility for research.
b) The Executive Headteacher of the TSA has developed a 'Leadership Pathway Map' through this project. This now underpins a suite of senior and middle leader professional development programmes across the Alliance.
c) In another school, 'resilience', the theme of the partnership work, is reported by the headteacher to now be 'embedded' in the school. Well-being remains high on the school agenda and staff absence has become 'minimal'. There have been improved measurable pupil outcomes which are in 2015, 'the best ever in Foundation, KS1 and Year 1 phonics, with a sharp upward trend at KS2.'
d) The research team developed a leadership capacity building model in an Alliance school that is located in one of the most deprived communities in Nottingham. Researchers worked closely with the headteacher and her senior leadership team over two terms to improve the effectiveness of leadership and management in the school. This was a response to one of the school's improvement priorities identified by the Ofsted.

This bespoke leadership development project demonstrated promising evidence showing that pupil attainment at Level 4 or above in reading, writing and maths increased from 65% in 2013 to 76% in 2014, with 80%, 100% and 90% of disadvantaged pupils having made at least 2 levels of progress in the three subjects respectively. The results of Year 1 phonics increased from 62% in 2013 to 90% in 2014. 
e) Key members of the research team are currently working with the Transform TSA and other neighbouring TSAs to organize a regional conference entitled 'Using Interventions and Evidence for Improvement' in November 2015. The conference is aimed at promoting research-engaged collaborative culture within and between schools. This is another example which shows that this knowledge exchange project has significantly deepened the trust and collaborative capital between the University of Nottingham and the local and regional school community - which will no doubt lead to further collaborative work and teacher and school improvement projects.

In sum, the knowledge gained from this knowledge exchange project continues to impact on the participant schools and has been widely disseminated to influence the work of practitioner stakeholders in the education system.

Academic community
4. The research findings have been presented at national and international school leadership conferences (AERA, BERA, EERA, BELMAS)
5. Research findings will be published in book form with Routledge in 2016</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C9C1B17B-7CB6-4057-B8A6-C9D33F81BE6F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This twelve month knowledge transfer project with schools in urban disadvantaged contexts focussed on using 'fit for purpose' knowledge generated by academics to assist school leaders in designing and implementing research-informed school-based inquiries which were relevant to the context and development needs of their schools. This was achieved through establishing school-university partnerships. Examples of the processes, organisation and results are provided in the accompanying documentation and the interactive project website. During the project the head teachers became knowledge creators, supported by academics in provider and brokerage roles.

As a result of the project the head teachers have determined to continue with research-informed inquiry work in their own schools and, as part of a Teaching Schools Alliance, to spread the work among colleagues. Continuing challenges are the relative intensity and unpredictability of leading schools that serve pupils from emotionally, economically and socially disadvantaged communities. 

The project produced ten key messages about how academic knowledge may be effectively transferred and the impact of this upon leaders' improved capacity to lead research informed inquiries to improve practice:

i) The learning worlds of academics and school practitioners are different. The worlds of the practitioners are characterised by 'busyness' and multiple social interactions whereas the worlds of academics are characterised by the demands of knowledge production;

ii) Academically derived knowledge needs to be expressed in terms which are perceived to be meaningful by the practitioner recipients and relevant to their development priorities;

iii) To influence, academics need to be able to understand and engage with practitioners' worlds so that academic knowledge may be 'fit for purpose' and able to be effectively integrated with their personal, practical and contextual knowledge; 

iv) New academic knowledge in itself is unlikely to have cumulative and lasting influence without the credibility, trustworthiness and strategic acumen of the academic partner; 

v) Headteachers and their staff are unlikely to invest in acquiring academically generated knowledge without confidence in this credibility;

vi) Headteachers are likely to have different dispositions towards the value of research, be in different phases of their own development and be managing different sets of challenges in their schools;

vii) To influence successfully, academics themselves need technical and human relating qualities and skills;
viii) Effective knowledge school-university partnerships need to be developmental and sustained. They are likely to require shifts in occupationally embedded mind sets;

ix) Knowledge of processes of social influence through negotiation is, therefore, essential to academics who wish to engage in these partnerships; 

x) The success of school-university partnerships rests upon the nature, forms and quality of the collaboration. Effective collaboration is built over time, earned rather than given, and requires an on-going commitment from all parties. Levels of commitment may vary according to the individual and fluctuate over time according to anticipated and unanticipated events at school level that require urgent attention of the headteacher. In such circumstances, it is the practitioners' work imperatives that take precedence over the partnership. Academics need, therefore, to be flexible and resilient.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Pathways to Impact statement contained six impact mechanisms and details of the project's short, medium and long term impact plans. The text below refers to these:
During the year, we held regular face-to-face meetings individually with the school leaders (in their schools) and collectively through thematically focussed workshops at key phases of the project's development. Within and between these, we co-constructed the design of the in-school inquiries and created new 'fit for purpose' academic and leadership training materials (Impact mechanisms 1,4). An interactive web space and, at the end of the project, a public-facing website were created and launched at a national dissemination conference. This contains project materials and documented results of the school-based inquiries (Impact mechanisms 2,3,5) We have presented the project results at the European Education Research Association Conference, will present these at the American Education Research Association Conference and have a book contract with Routledge (Impact mechanism 6). We fulfilled our short and medium-term impact plans but have not yet achieved our long-term impact plans to establish a School-University Knowledge Exchange Network beyond the outward facing website, although the teaching school alliance of which the participant schools are members has committed itself to extending this work to other schools.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3B1ED093-0995-45DE-9357-4894C64B2762</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/education/KTEN</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/882C7C9F-81D6-4F8E-99C7-30A005197F4C"><gtr:id>882C7C9F-81D6-4F8E-99C7-30A005197F4C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transforming the Quality of Education in High-need Communities: Schools-university partnerships for change</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1d13dc155311048c29b47d24aa911665"><gtr:id>1d13dc155311048c29b47d24aa911665</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Day C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EFF98501-C03C-4777-9403-B0B33220E44F"><gtr:id>EFF98501-C03C-4777-9403-B0B33220E44F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Influences on Capacities for Emotional Resilience of Teachers in Schools Serving Disadvantaged Urban Communities: Challenges of Living on the Edge</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Teaching and Teacher Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1a766f2305d259f8790a44159987dd8a"><gtr:id>1a766f2305d259f8790a44159987dd8a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Day, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K007750/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1A4C7E39-EE28-48D9-AE87-3E028461DA42</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Elements of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A05AA82B-96A8-4834-97FE-23963DE22DB5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Phases of education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
