On 7 July 2014 Home Secretary Theresa May announced a public inquiry into how complaints of sexual abuse have been dealt with by public bodies over the last 40 years; the inquiry will produce an interim report by May 2015, with a full report to follow at a later stage. A 10-week investigation has also been launched into allegations relating to Whitehall politicians. These announcements follow the NHS and Department of Health Investigations into Matters Relating to Jimmy Savile (published on 26 June 2014); a second report is due in 2015. The enquiries will hear important evidence from witnesses and examine files associated with the bodies under scrutiny. As yet, however, our knowledge of the broader history of sexual abuse in the twentieth century is extremely partial, with some incidents well charted and others ignored. A full understanding of the wider historical circumstances that have shaped social, legal and political responses to child sexual abuse (or their lack) is urgently needed to provide missing information to contextualise and complement these public inquiries.

This research project will carry out rapid deck-based research, using very significant sets of online sources that are already available in digital form, but whose potential for research into the history of child sexual abuse has not been realised. It will cover four significant areas:

1. We will construct quantitative profiles of the extent of the reporting and convictions of sexual offences from 1918 to 1990, making use of the published Criminal Justice Statistics for England and Wales.

2. We will carry out a qualitative longitudinal study of the role of the national and local newspaper press in reporting cases of child sexual abuse, and in shaping social attitudes towards young people and sexuality in the period 1918-1990. The newspaper press was a crucial arena through which public opinion was shaped and shifting moralities were discussed and debated for much of the twentieth century. Whilst the press cannot be viewed as an unproblematic barometer of opinion, it provides historians with an important lens through which to access a range of viewpoints and to chart dominant tropes and narratives. A survey of the newspaper press also enables us to access reports of the decisions that were made in the court-room and thus to further explain the trends for reporting and conviction that analysis of the criminal justice statistics reveal.

3. We will examine the shifting viewpoints of key professional groups, including social workers and lawyers, by undertaking a survey of publications associated with these occupational groups. 

4. We will begin a mapping of organisations, bodies and associations who have commented on and campaigned around issues relating to children and sexuality across the broad period 1918-1990. This initial mapping will involve research into the availability of archival and manuscripts sources (including those held in the National Archives and local repositories) and will form the basis of a further funding application.

Our time-table is designed to coincide with the undertaking of the public enquiries and the preparation of the further report relating to the NHS and Department of Health Investigations. We will run seminars/workshops for civil servants, lawyers and other professionals involved in these investigations, and make our findings available in a free and easily accessible format as briefings on the History &amp;amp; Policy website. Thus our project will provide essential knowledge to shape discussion, debate, and inform the final public inquiry reports.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will inform and contextualise the public enquiries that are currently taking place into the extent of historical child sexual abuse cases committed by celebrity and other figures who abused their authority and power. Research findings will be of immediate use to lawyers, civil servants and other policy makers associated with the enquiry teams who work in the field. The project is also designed to enable journalists and other commentators to interpret the enquiry reports by providing broader historical understanding, accessibly presented, of the social attitudes and responses of the criminal justice system during the period under investigation. 

The project will involve a key partnership between the investigators and History &amp;amp; Policy (http://www.historyandpolicy.org/), a network of historians which facilitates the use of historical research by policy-makers and media. 

Through History &amp;amp; Policy we will engage with the following targeted groups of users in the following specific ways.

1. In October 2012 the Secretary of State for Health asked Kate Lampard QC to provide independent oversight of the NHS and Department of Health investigations into Jimmy Savile's relationships with NHS organisations and his activities on their premises. The oversight team commissioned H&amp;amp;P to organise a discussion event at King's College, London, on 7 May 2013, with presentations from eight historians including the current project team. Lampard commented in her assurance report of June 2014 that 'the event provided the investigation teams with valuable understanding of the historical context for Savile's associations with NHS organisations and his offending on their premises'. We will build on these existing links to make our research findings available to the oversight team as further briefings.

2. We will liaise with senior civil servants at the Home Office to enable effective take-up of findings in relation to the public inquiries, through workshops and briefings; we will also submit written evidence to the public inquiries.

3. We will publish our findings as briefing reports on the H&amp;amp;P website in early May 2015 and use social media to facilitate media take-up.

4. We will publish a feature spread in an accessible public history periodical such as History Today to disseminate the research to wider audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>106343</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Through History &amp;amp; Policy (a national network of historians which promotes and facilitates the use of historical research by policy-makers and the media), the project team has raised awareness of the social, legal and political contexts that have structured responses to child sexual abuse over past decades (from the 1920s onwards) and, in many cases, may have prevented abuse from being reported. 

We have published opinion pieces and briefing papers on the History &amp;amp; Policy website and an article for a broad public audience in the magazine History Today. These in turn have led to invitations to speak to the media (eg. Radio 4's Today Programme on 28 February 2015; Channel 4 News on 20 May 2015; interview for BBC documentary series on the history of Scottish childhood in May 2016). 

The team has also been invited to share findings with practitioners and policy-makers. In February 2016 Dr Adrian Bingham and Dr Lucy Delap presented project findings at a development day on child sexual abuse and exploitation for the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Dr Delap also spoke to front-line practitioners at the St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre annual conference in Manchester in April 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9A79C69D-86D9-4D0C-8F97-389517CFEDF4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this project was to carry out rigorous but rapid historical research to map and analyse social, criminal justice, and political responses to child sexual abuse since the First World War in England and Wales in order to contextualise and complement the public inquiries now in process. 

Key findings include:

1. The role of the law and criminal justice
Collection and analysis of data from the annual criminal justice statistics for England and Wales have shown that in excess of 500 people were dealt with by the courts per year during the 1920s, rising incrementally to over 5000 by the 1960s. Throughout, this represented merely the tip of an iceberg. Whilst the number of cases reported to the police increased incrementally across the period, evidence suggests there was a significant decline in the proportion that resulted in guilty verdicts; it is also very clear that across time child sexual abuse has been significantly under-reported.

2. The role of the newspaper press.
Press coverage has been vital in pushing child sexual abuse up the public agenda since the 1970s: it has encouraged survivors to report offences and prompted politicians, local authorities, social workers and the police to develop policy responses. For most of the twentieth century, however, the press missed numerous opportunities to define and highlight child sexual abuse as a problem. Reporting was usually brief, euphemistic and focused on human interest rather than on the cultures and practices that enabled abuse. The failure of the press to prioritise child sexual abuse as a social problem can be attributed to its adherence to the definitions and assumptions of the legal system, its reliance on court reporting as a source of entertainment and titillation rather than social commentary, the male dominance of newsrooms, and the weakness of its investigative tradition.

3. Welfare and social work responses
Initial work on archival material shows that sexual abuse was well recognised by voluntary and statutory social workers in the early twentieth century, although often described by them as incest, perversion or 'moral danger'. Awareness focused on working-class girls because it was aligned with other concerns such as prostitution, unmarried pregnancy, and venereal disease. Abuse of boys was not prioritised; abuse of middle class children was rarely perceived. Oversight of children's welfare was divided between competing branches of social work (psychiatric, moral welfare, child care) and other professions. This made for fragmented decision-making, and failures of communication between different agencies responsible for safeguarding. Where evidence of sexual assault emerged, the reaction of welfare workers was to limit harm, often by removing a child from an abusive situation; reporting of abuse and securing convictions was a secondary concern. Feminist campaigning brought new attention to child physical and sexual abuse in the 1970s and 1980s, amongst social workers, police and the medical profession. However, there was little public support for the interventions of social workers against 'family abuse', particularly after the Cleveland scandal of 1987-8. Clear guidelines for best practice were not established until the 1990s.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Key findings have already been published in the form of three briefing papers (and one opinion piece) on the History &amp;amp; Policy website and an article appeared in the magazine History Today (October 2015). Presentations and discussion with a variety of audiences have been initiated and will take place into 2016. A key aim of the project is to make its findings available to non-academic audiences and we continue to work with History &amp;amp; Policy on this. In relation to academic audiences, we have been invited to contribute an article to a special issue of the journal History of Education (submitted and awaiting final review) alongside articles by other historians engaged in research as part of or related to historic child sexual abuse inquiries in other parts of the globe. Alongside other contributors to the special issue we will be giving a paper on our findings at the European Social Science History Conference in Valencia in April 2016; this will enable us to develop and extend comparative discussion. A further article (on the newspaper press) has been drafted and will be submitted to a journal shortly.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B199B641-20AB-4F4E-A1E8-EC1B0B4589E5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.historyandpolicy.org/projects/project/historical-child-sex-abuse</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset contains references to newspaper articles relating to what is now described as child sexual abuse 1918-1970 that have been collected through keywords searches of British newspapers that are available in digitised form.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0C44304-1D3A-4D90-8DF0-9EF5A12E0952</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This dataset has been deposited with the UKDataService.
