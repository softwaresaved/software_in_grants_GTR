It is necessary during development to produce organs and tissues of the correct size and continued control throughout life is also essential. Cancer is a disease where the normal control of the cell cycle has been lost, resulting in the uncontrolled proliferation of certain cells. There are two reasons to investigate the manner in which control of the animal cell cycle is regulated in C. elegans. C. elegans is a small and experimentally tractable animal. Its genome has been completely sequence and can be compared with that of humans. Many genes and key biological processes are shared between all animals and research on C. elegans can help in elucidating how genes function in humans. C elegans is a model organism where processes relevant to human disease can be easily and efficiently investigated. Additionally, some nematode species are important tropical parasites of humans. Because of the importance of the cell cycle in human malignancies, the pharmaceutical industry is developing drugs that target various molecules involved in driving the cell cycle in humans. It is highly probable that many of these drugs, or close relative, could target the cell cycle of parasitic nematodes. Developing systems to permit the investigation of parasitic nematode cell cycle molecules in an experimentally tractable way may provide new methods of identifying potential antiparasitic drugs. 
IJ will detail research findings on the web in a manner that is accessible to the general public and will also agree to talk to the media if requested.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The proposed research will use the small and experimentally tractable free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate control of the cell cycle within a single tissue, the intestine. We have previously performed mutant screens and obtained three classes of mutant with defects in distinct aspects of cell cycle control in the C. elegans intestine. In research funded by a MRC Co-op Group Component Grant over the last three years, we have worked on two of these mutants belonging to the class that cause intestinal cell hyperplasia. We have found one of these mutants to be a gain-of-function allele in one of four C. elegans homologues of the central cell cycle regulator, CDC25. This mutation is positioned within the amino-terminal regulatory region of the CDC25. The proposal includes work to further investigate this CDC25 to determine the reasons for the tissue specific nature of the hyperplasia and identify molecules and pathways that regulate the function of this CDC25 in the nematode intestine. We will test if the intestinal hyperplasia of the mutant can be generated by the catalytic phosphatase domains of other CDC25s by performing domain swaps with the amino terminal regulatory region of the mutant C. elegans CDC25 and the catalytic domains of other CDC25s from C. elegans, from the parasitic nematode species Brugia malai, and with a human CDC25. If successful, this would demonstrate that the tissue specific behaviour of the mutant protein was conferred purely by the amino terminal regulatory region of the molecule, and also provide a tool to investigate the catalytic activity of other CDC25s in this genetically tractable system. 
We have provisional evidence that the second mutant with an intestinal cell hyperplasia is a partial loss-of-function in a C. elegans dynein gene. The proposal includes further research with this mutant to confirm its identity and to determine at a molecular level, how the hyperplasia is caused. 
The two other classes of mutant will also be investigated with a view to cloning and characterising the genes identified. We have three alleles in different genes (not yet cloned) that cause the nuclei of C. elegans intestinal cells to undergo an additional nuclear division during post embryonic development, generating tetra-nucleate cells. We have one allele that causes a nuclear division that normally occurs in most intestinal cells of the wild type, to fail. This lesion also causes a proliferative failure in the germline resulting in sterility.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-07-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250953</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/13FA14F3-B010-465B-A9DB-25BA80727C02"><gtr:id>13FA14F3-B010-465B-A9DB-25BA80727C02</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fate specification and tissue-specific cell cycle control of the Caenorhabditis elegans intestine.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular biology of the cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/47343d7a6f71b615d946cd5ce1af5d57"><gtr:id>47343d7a6f71b615d946cd5ce1af5d57</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Segref A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1059-1524</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0301078</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
