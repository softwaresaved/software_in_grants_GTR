of non-animal origin have been increasing over the last decade, reflecing rising consumers' demands for fresh/minimallyprocessed
fruit and vegetables. Crops where a post-harvest management period takes place outside are particularly at risk.
project focuses on Salmonella contamination of vine fruits (raisins, sultanas), which are dried outside post harvest and
exposed to fouling by birds. The impacts throughout the supply chain are signifcant, from the grower to the retailer, for
example the product recall costs in the UK are estimated to be at least &amp;pound;500K per year. It is difficult to remove Salmonella
from vine fruits using existing technologies and we propose to develop a novel and bespoke product based on
bacteriophages (phages) that specifically target this pathogen and that can be applied during the on farm processing of the
fruit. The Lead Organisation in the proposal: APS Biocontrol Ltd. [APS] has already developed an innovative technology for
plant pathogen control, based on safe, naturally-occurring, highly specific phages. This project will see APS team with a
UK academic, Prof Martha Clokie from the University of Leicester who has led several Reseach Council and Charitable
Trust funded bacteriophage reseach and development projects, and who has experience and expertise in working with both
Salmonella and phages. APS and the Leicester team will work together in order translate APS' technology to prevent onfarm
crop contamination by Salmonella. Whilst the technology will be applied mainly outside of the UK, financial benefits
will be realised in the UK: improved food security, reduced wastage and increased trade. The consortium combines
technology specialists (APS), academic experts (Leicester), a major producer (Community Foods) and the UK's market
leader in dried fruit sales (Tesco), who will encourage technology pull-through by using the hage product on the vine fruits
that they sell.The focus of our work is the vine fruit industry (raisins and sultanas), where contamination with pathogens (mainly
Salmonella) can have catastrophic effects throughout the supply chain. Vine fruits represent half of the global dried fruit
supply chain (2014 value: $7,470m - a 5% increase on 2013), wih UK companies representing 15-20% of this market both
by imports and by growing through partners. Currently only a relatively small amount of of the vine fruits are tested for
Salmonella contamination, but as the scale of this Industry-wide problem of Salmonella contamination of vine fruits is
appreciated, this is likely to change. Increased testing will reveal the full extent of the problem which will lead to significant
further financial impact on the industry.In order to address this problem, we are an industrially-driven multi-partner consortium and will develop a technologyenabled, strategic innovation for managing Salmonella contamination, with treatments based on formulations of naturallyoccurring, highly-specific and environmentally-acceptable agents phages. The project will involve technology translation from academia, laboratory-scale development and pilot field trials. The project is in line with the UK Strategy for Agricultural Technologies through translating research into practice. It will develop and exploit a biocontrol technology in the UK, led by an innovative SME. The technology has the potential to reach global markets, with significant return to the UK Agri-Tech
industry, benefiting UK research and production, the country's export and import businesses, as well as the retail industry.
Also, the focus on new biocontrols aligns with EU policy to reduce the impact of pesticide use on people's health and the
environment. It also aligns with recommendations for a better analysis of the prevalence of food-borne pathogens and
relevant implementation of Good Agricultural Practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>As above</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project directly addresses a key challenge in global primary crop production; bacterial contamination of crops postharvest
(pre-farm gate) - specifically, those having an outside drying period on-farm, exposed to potential fouling
contamination by animals, which can have significant implications to downstream processing and human health. We will
achieve this through targeted, bespoke biocontrol applications, &amp;quot;evaluating the technical feasibility of an idea and
establishing proof-of-concept and potential routes to exploitation&amp;quot;; the key remit of the Industrial Research Awards. The
project will therefore impact both &amp;quot;primary crop and livestock production&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;addressing challenges in downstream food
processing&amp;quot; (with a solution within primary production), aligning with a number of the suggested topic areas within this call;
e.g. crop harvesting and storage, sustainability of production methods, reducing adverse impacts on the environment and
limiting human health issues.
