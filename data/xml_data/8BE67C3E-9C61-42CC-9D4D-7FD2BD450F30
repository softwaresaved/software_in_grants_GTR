They have profoundly negative impacts through crop and food damage, carry human and animal diseases, cause allergy and asthma, and damage to the built environment. The costs of rodent infestations are difficult to quantify, but worldwide this runs to many billions of pounds. For example, food loss and damage caused by rats in the United States alone was estimated as $19 billion in 2000. In rice-growing regions, rodents cause annual pre-harvest losses of 5-17%: models suggest that a 5% reduction in rodent losses to the cereal harvest in undernourished countries could feed one third of all undernourished people worldwide. In the built environment, cable damage presents a significant risk of fire and electrocution, with costs of damage to infrastructure in the UK estimated around &amp;pound;200 million (2004). Rodents are also important in the spread of a large number of livestock and human diseases, including foodborne diseases; and contribute a significant source of allergens in residential areas that correlate with asthmatic symptoms. Current control strategies rely heavily on widespread and rather indiscriminate use of rodenticides, although the need for more integrated pest management approaches is increasingly recognized. Anticoagulant rodenticides (at least 90% of those used within Europe) are coming under increasing regulatory pressures due to persistence in the environment and negative impact on non-target species. There are growing problems of rodenticide resistance and public concern about humaneness. Thus, there are urgent needs to develop new control approaches, to significantly increase the efficiency and targeting of conventional approaches, and to develop alternative non-lethal approaches that increase the effectiveness, sustainability and humaneness of rodent control. Our goal is to develop new tools and strategies for rodent pest control, based on the use of scent signals (semiochemicals) to manipulate roent behaviour. Rodents are critically dependent on scent cues for social communication, for the coordination of reproduction and reproductive investment, for navigation around the habitat and for predator avoidance. This provides the opportunity to manipulate such signals for control purposes, as has been developed very successfully for insect pest control. However, the complexity and individual variability of mammalian scent cues, combined with flexible and adaptive responses, demands a subtle integrated and interdisciplinary approach to understand the key components of signal and response and establish the potential for manipulation from a practical perspective. To achieve this, we bring together world-leading experts in wild rodent behaviour and chemical communication, the chemistry of volatile and protein pheromones, and the deployment of semiochemical-mediated strategies for pest control. The programme will focus on house mice and brown rats as the two most important rodent pests in the UK and worldwide, and will generate approaches that can also be translated to other rodent pest species. Our specific objectives are to * build a full understanding of the scent components that stimulate behaviours that have considerable potential for pest control; * understand scent deposits and signals and how these change with scent age, so that we can mimic them for pest control and use them to monitor infestations; * explore how to exploit the flexible learning that is typical of mammalian responses to scents; * test the ability of synthetic signals to manipulate key aspects of behaviour and reproduction in semi-natural environments. A stakeholder group comprising representatives of the pest control, environmental health and food industries, regulatory bodies, and scientific expertise of rodent pests in developing countries will ensure appropriate focus and provide pathways to the industries involved for subsequent deployment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our goal is to develop new tools and strategies for rodent pest control, based on the use of scent signals (semiochemicals) to manipulate rodent behaviour. Rodents are critically dependent on scent communication to coordinate reproductive behaviour and investment, competitive and cooperative interactions with conspecifics, habitat navigation and avoidance of predation. Three types of signal, involving volatile and involatile components, have strong potential for exploitation: pheromones used to recognize safe sites and trails; pheromones involved in sexual attraction and competitive signaling; and predator scents that stimulate avoidance. These signals induce strong innate responses combined with learning that underpins the typical flexible and adaptive use of semiochemicals by mammals. We will build an integrated understanding of the scent components and responses that could be used to improve the effectiveness and targeting of conventional control methods, or to provide new non-rodenticide approaches. This interdisciplinary programme involves specialists in rodent behaviour and scent communication, chemical ecology and biochemistry of volatile and protein pheromones and their carriers. We will combine gas and liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, NMR, chemical/protein synthesis and scent manipulation, integrated with appropriate behavioural bioassays, to identify and characterise key constituents of both signal and response, and define the dynamics between volatile components and proteins that bind them. Once we have identified and synthesized stimuli that have key effects under laboratory conditions, we will test their ability to replicate or disrupt normal behaviour in semi-natural environments where responses can be fully monitored. A Stakeholder group of relevant national / international industry representatives, external organizations and individual experts will provide guidance to maintain a realistic focus and provide a clear pathway to exploitation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The scientific outputs from this project will have significant benefits in terms of food security, human and livestock health, the economic impact of infrastructure damage, and the potential for reduced ecological and other damage to non-target species. The potential benefits have both a national and an international perspective as this proposal focuses on rodent species that are worldwide pests and addresses fundamental aspects of the behaviour of rodents and their use of information in scents. The importance of this proposal is highlighted by the level of end-user support (see attached letters of support). Improved food security, gained through better rodent control will have major benefits for: * food producers and retailers, by reducing major losses at all levels of production, storage and distribution of a wide variety of foods; reduced contamination events and the negative impact on consumer perception of brand; * reduction of food costs to the general public and increased food available to undernourished people particularly in developing countries; given the predicted substantial increase in food demand over the next 50 years, it is essential to find more effective ways to reduce pre and post harvest losses to rodents; * reduction in the spread of food-borne diseases through rodent vectors such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, benefiting livestock farmers, the general public, the health services, the catering industry and reduced sickness costs to industry. A reduction in other rodent-borne diseases, such as leptospirosis, lymphocytic chorio-meningitis, pasteurellosis, cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis and swine dysentery, and reduction in rodent allergens correlated with asthma, will benefit: * human health (public, health service and industry benefits); * livestock producers; * environmental health services and hospitals; * the welfare of livestock and other animals including companion, laboratory and zoo animals at risk of rodent-borne infections. Prevention of damage to materials and infrastructure will have major benefits for: * private industry and public services responsible for maintaining infrastructure damaged by rodents; * industry and the general public through reduction in rodent damage, for example to communications and electric cabling, machinery and reduced risk of fires and electrocution; * industry through reduction in damage and spoilage to insulation and packaging materials. Improved targeting and efficiency of conventional rodenticides and traps through the application of scent signals, or the use of information in natural scent deposits to monitor infestations, will provide: * new products and tools for manufacturers, distributors and service companies in the pest control industry or public services; * reduction in the amount and distribution of rodenticide used, reducing the exposure of non-target species such as predators or other non-pest animals that take toxic baits, of increasing concern to regulators and society; * improved efficiency of control at low population densities, reducing the number of individuals killed by rodenticides with commensurate reduction in the welfare costs of rodent control and the exposure of predators and scavengers to toxic prey. The development of additional non-lethal approaches will benefit: * regulators requiring a reduction in the use of rodenticides that are highly persistent in the environment; * the pest control industry and customers seeking alternatives to the use of rodenticides; * industry, environmental health services and the general public, particularly if new European regulation limits the conventional use of rodenticides to control rodents; * societal concerns about the humaneness of rodenticides as the main means of rodent control.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3065748</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, Berkeley</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Museum of Vertebrate Zoology</gtr:department><gtr:description>MUP genetic polymorphism</gtr:description><gtr:id>96373C47-FF10-4D85-B984-E24171F8AEC0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Published primary paper in PLOS Genetics (see url above).

I had the pleasure of delivering a Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique discussion in Glasgow in May. This is a very long running forum, and has been run by Professor Mandy McLean and her colleagues since 2004 (Prof McLean received an MBE in 2010 for her public engagement activities - who says outreach doesn't get recognised?).

The title of my talk was 'The cell, a factory run by actors'. The format was a 20minute introduction (no slides, no projector -a refreshing change that would do us all good from time to time - I prepared so much better without the crutch of slides to prop me up) - I introduced myself as a protein chemist, discussed proteins I had discovered in my career, and the fun to be had in naming them (the darcin story always gets a good reception) and then explained how 'proteins' (the term coined by Berzelius in 1838 from the Greek p??te??? ('proteios'), meaning 'of the first rank') had been embedded in literature and arts (think Kurt Vonnegut in 'Cat's Cradle and 'Space Oddity', jus for starters) but I also quoted one of my favourite books, 'For the Love of Enzymes: The Odyssey of a Biochemist' in which he said, paraphrasing &amp;quot;DNA and RNA provide the script, but proteins are the actors&amp;quot;.

I then directed the audience (between 30 and 40 people) to the first question on my short pub quiz. They were challenged to calculate how many possible proteins of 300 amino acids there could be (prefaced by a chat about polymers, building blocks and the significance of precise order). The audience did it! As Douglas Adams might have said, the answer is 'a hugely, mindbogglingly big number' and far exceeds the number of atoms in the Universe. We then addressed the logical outcome, that the evolution of life on this planet very quickly got locked into a tiny little corner of the hyperdimensional space of 'all possible proteins', and that 'out there' in that hyperdimensional space, there were perfect antimicrobials, cures for all diseases, proteins that could support green chemistry, proteins that were as clear and sparkled like diamonds. If only we knew how to get to them (and synthetic biology is not the answer).

The second part of my short introduction talked about complexity. We discussed the size of a yeast cell (100 cells end to end in one millimetre) and the complexity of this cell compared to an Airbus A3800 - the yeast cell has about 60 million molecules, the A380 has only 4 million parts, which led to the final part of my introduction - how do you manage this complexity, controlling the number of each protein a cell needs, and changing those numbers to respond to demand (stimuli) Is the cell a 'just in time' manufacturer, a 'just in case' manufacturer or a 'rapid recycler'?&amp;nbsp;

The following discussion (90minutes, with a very welcome bar break in the middle) was fabulous. This was a switched on audience - we ranged from pre-biotic evolution through panspermy to insulin secretion as a 'just in time' process. Inevitably, the darcin story took us back to a detailed discussion about the sex life of the mouse, a change to amuse, inform and extol the value of multidisciplinary collaboration with Jane Hurst and colleagues in Leahurst as behavioural ecologists par excellence. Inevitably we addressed the issue of how we do this work and the need for protein chemists to be 'technologically overstimulated' -especially for the big projects like our recently published study that quantified the number, in copies per cell, of over 2,000 yeast proteins.

I loved every minute of it. The QandA session was chaired by Vanessa Collingridge, broadcaster and writer, who was terrific.

To any of my colleagues who are thinking about this, my advice is 'go for it!'. Leave the slides behind, don't overplay the minutiae, and enjoy two hours in the company of an interested and intelligent audience who challenge you to jump around in your favourite playground - the subject that brings you in to work every morning with a bounce!
