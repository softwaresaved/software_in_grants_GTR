Islands, maritime connectivity and the 'western seaways' of Britain, 5000-3500 BC</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I021841/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Research context\n\nThe Neolithic is the term used for the period in our past when the shift from hunting and gathering wild animals and plants to a farming lifestyle occurred. This change happened at different times and in different ways throughout the world, beginning around 10,000 BC in the Middle East and around 4,000 BC in Britain and Ireland. The process by which the Neolithic arrived in Britain and Ireland is currently a hotly debated topic. Some scholars argue that colonists moved wholesale from the continent (bringing farming, pottery, etc. with them from France and/or Belgium), but others have suggested that the indigenous population of Britain gradually adopted the farming lifestyle on their own terms (possibly as a result of a broad shift in their worldview). What is agreed is that some contact between Britain, Ireland and the European mainland must have occurred in the centuries around 4000 BC for the change to happen at all, and that this most likely happened across the 'western seaways' - an arc of sea extending approximately from the Channel Islands in the south, through the Isles of Scilly, the Isle of Man and the Hebrides, around to Orkney in the north.\n\n\nAims and objectives\n\nThe Stepping Stones project places the islands around Britain firmly at the centre of this key contemporary archaeological debate. This project contends that a detailed understanding of Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic activity within this important zone of contact has the potential to make a crucial contribution to our understanding of the processes of transition, both within the western seaways and on either side. Our central research questions are:\n\n- When did the Neolithic arrive on each island group within the western seaways? \n\n- What is the earliest Neolithic evidence on each island group? Does the presence of 'foreign' artefacts suggest the arrival of colonists from the Continent?\n\n- What was the sea like during this period, and how did any changes affect seafaring practices?\n\nIn order to answer these questions, we will: \n\n- Create a new database of all known Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic sites (and associated radiocarbon dates) within the western seaways zone\n\n- Excavate one site on each of three different island groups, to find new evidence where very little is currently known \n\n- Carry out a major programme of radiocarbon dating to date the arrival of the Neolithic on each island group \n\n- Undertake a new programme of oceanographic modelling, in order to establish where the sea actually was, and what sailing across it would have been like, between 5000 and 3500 BC\n\n\nApplications and benefits\n\nWe feel that it is vital for the project to benefit both the academic community and the wider public. \n\nWe will publish our academic results via a series of journal papers, and will also hold an international conference about prehistoric connections between Britain, Ireland and the Continent (leading to an edited book on the same theme). We will also disseminate our findings to public sector bodies in order to ensure that they are able to use them when drafting policy documents designed to safeguard coastal sites in future.\n\nIn order to ensure that the wider public are able to find out as much as possible about the project, we will hold a number of outreach events to coincide with our excavations (open days, public lectures, museum displays, etc.). We will also develop a series of educational web resources linked directly to the project's research. These will include:\n\n- A website, setting out the project's results in accessible language\n\n- A 'western seaways' navigation game, designed to give children (and others) a fun angle on prehistoric seafaring\n\n- A Google Earth 'plugin', enabling users to visualise changing sea levels in the past, providing an important deep-time context for modern and</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>English Heritage's draft Research Strategy for Prehistory states that 'prehistory is poorly understood among the British public in comparison to other historical periods', highlighting the All-Party Parliamentary Archaeology Group's 2003 report which severely criticised the 'neglect' of prehistory within the UK's school curricula. In response to these issues, EH's strategy highlights the need for 'displays, web resources, community projects and other outreach initiatives to do with prehistory ... in order to engage new audiences and provide teachers with what they need'. Our first three pathways to impact will provide a set of resources designed to benefit the wider public in exactly these ways.\n\nThe project's most immediate impact will occur during the course of our excavations, in which we will involve a broad cross-section of the local community. For each site, we will hold one open day and one public lecture. Given the main target audience of the project website, we will also work closely with local primary schools. In hosting these events, we will be engaging the general public in aspects of their island's cultural heritage, and so contributing to their knowledge and quality of life. We will also invite members of local amateur archaeology societies to take part in our excavations, providing them with an opportunity to develop archaeological skills and experience, and to share their ideas and expertise with us.\n\nIn conjunction with our project partner museums, we will produce a display to run concurrent with each excavation. These will help visitors to appreciate the importance of each island group in terms of the big questions being asked. In drawing on a 'live' excavation and research project, these displays will bring a fresh, contemporary feel to each museum. Overall, this will lead to financial benefits for the museum and the local area plus cultural and social benefits for visitors. The project will also involve the analysis and publication of artefact collections previously recovered from each site; this will add considerable value to these existing museum resources.\n\nAlongside these island-specific impact strategies, we will also develop a series of innovative and engaging, but firmly educational web resources. Their main target audience will be primary school age children, but the content will also be relevant to the wider public. Again, the structure of this element will be tiered, with the local scale of each island group being made clearly relevant to bigger issues (e.g. sea level change over time). These will provide schools with a new teaching resource, and the general public with an accessible learning experience.\n\nThe project also has significant potential to impact upon government and public sector policy. 'Research framework' documents are currently being written for the Isles of Scilly, Scotland, and the 'maritime and marine historic environment' in England. Both DG and FS have been asked to contribute to the former, FS is a co-author and project director of the latter. Our research will be conducted in relation to the research aims outlined in these documents, but given the present paucity of Early Neolithic settlement evidence, it is likely that our findings will change them significantly for the future as well. In addition, because all three of the sites to be excavated are under direct threat from coastal erosion, our findings will have significant policy and scheduling implications for how sites in sensitive coastal environments such as these are managed in future. Research into the impact of coastal erosion was identified as one of six 'critical priorities' within EH's Strategy. Importantly, our palaeoenvironmental work will provide time series data that can be used to assess rates of coastal change and erosion over the Holocene.

1. Public participation in excavations (and associated events)
Our excavations were spread over three different islands/island groups around Britain (Guernsey, Channel Islands; St Martin's, Isles of Scilly; South Uist, Outer Hebrides). We had very successful public participation in all three, in terms of (1) local people helping out on our excavations, (2) local people, tourists and school groups visiting our sites on open days, and (3) local people and tourists coming along to our related museum talks. All of these groups reported a changed understanding of the region's prehistoric past following their visits. We also achieved substantial media coverage within each island group and beyond. As well as increasing people's sense of belonging to, or interest in, the local areas concerned, we were able to enskill and train a number of local amateur archaeologists who helped out on our excavations. 

In total, our public engagement numbers were as follows:
- Museum display visitors: 5700 (4200 Guernsey; 1300 Scilly; 200 [estimated] Uist) 
- Open Day visitors: 450
- Museum lecture attendees: 185
- Local people participating in our excavations: 14
- Press coverage: 14 newspaper/website, 8 radio, 2 TV

In addition to these island-specific events, we have also given a total of 12 talks at conferences or other events aimed at the general public around Britain (in addition to 9 that were aimed at a primarily academic audience, but would also have involved members of the public). 

2. New museum displays
Each of our three project partner local museums housed Stepping Stones project exhibitions during our excavation periods and beyond. In the case of Guernsey and Scilly, these were seen by thousands of visitors. In drawing on a 'live' excavation and current research project, these displays brought a contemporary feel to each museum. Overall, this led to financial benefits for the museums and their local areas, plus cultural and social benefits for visitors. In the longer term, our project has also enhanced the collections within these museums by (a) analysing and publishing artefact collections recovered previously from each site, and (b) providing new information about the archaeology of the region, adding understanding and thus value to the existing collections. 

3. Innovative web-based learning resources 
The project website was an active method of communication to all audiences from the start. Here we conveyed the results of our excavations to all interested parties, and provided access both to our 'western seaways' navigation game and to our chronologically animated Google Earth overlays, enabling users to visualise changing sea levels in the past. All three elements were designed to engage the wider public in relation to key elements of our research, providing innovative, accessible ways into our findings. In addition to the website, our project twitter feed currently has 780 followers, and the project youtube channel has had a total of 3554 views. Outputs from the project were also incorporated into week 3 of the free online course Shipwrecks and Submerged Worlds. In three runs this course has had over 20,000 participants. Specifically students on the course actively engaged with the work on sea-level change and reflected on what this meant in terms of their understanding of global, regional and local (pre)history. The inclusion of this content saw a deliberate attempt to move online learners from passive to active learning, with the associated content attracting detailed comments from participants.

4. Creation of new knowledge to inform government/public sector policy

As a direct consequence of our work in the Isles of Scilly, both PI Garrow and CI Sturt were invited to contribute to the 'Isles of Scilly Historic Environment Research Framework' (Johns 2012). This document was commissioned by English Heritage, with contributions from the Isles of Scilly AONB Unit, the Council of the Isles of Scilly and the Duchy of Cornwall. The document's main aim was the provision of a structure in which to make decisions about future historic environment research and heritage management. In addition, the sea-level 'time slice' maps we produced (downloadable as kmz files that can easily be integrated into GIS mapping projects) have already been used by a wide range of heritage management professionals as well as academics, enabling them to plot sites in relation to the prehistoric coastline more accurately than ever before. Specifically, the models have been: incorporated into the new Strategic Environmental Assessments commissioned by Department of Energy and Climate Change (delivered by the British Geological Survey), referenced as a major data source within Historic England's research into how we quantify and value submerged prehistoric archaeology (HE projects 6918 'Determining Potential' and 'The social context of submerged prehistory') and assessment of coastal heritage assets (Rapid Coastal Zone Assessments of Dorset, North Devon and Cornwall). Additionally, the sea-level outputs from this research have also been used within Environmental Impact Assessment processes for major capital infrastructure projects at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and for the London Array offshore wind farm.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2A7A968B-9A44-476A-85D7-183F5A3AE8A9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Neolithic is the period when the shift from hunting and gathering wild animals/plants to a farming lifestyle occurred. This change happened at different times throughout the world, beginning around 4000 BC in Britain and Ireland. The process by which the Neolithic arrived is currently a hotly debated topic. Some scholars argue that colonists moved wholesale from the continent, but others suggest that the indigenous population adopted a farming lifestyle on their own terms. What is agreed is that some contact between Britain, Ireland and the European mainland must have occurred in the centuries around 4000 BC for the change to occur at all, and that this most likely happened across the 'western seaways' - an arc of sea extending from the Channel Islands in the south, through the Isles of Scilly, the Isle of Man and the Hebrides, around to Orkney in the north.

The Stepping Stones project placed these island groups firmly at the centre of the debate, arguing that a detailed understanding of Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic activity within this important contact zone had the potential to make a crucial contribution to our understanding of the processes of transition, both within the western seaways and on either side.

Our main research goals were to:

- Excavate one site on each of three different island groups, to find new evidence 

- Undertake a programme of oceanographic modelling, to establish where the sea actually was, and what sailing across it would have been like 5000-3000 BC

- Create a database of all well-dated Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic sites within the western seaways zone and carry out a programme of radiocarbon dating to date the arrival of the Neolithic on each island group 

This project succeeded in meeting all of its objectives, having an impact on regional and national academic and heritage management agendas. 

All three of our excavations produced very exciting results, including the earliest extensively excavated Neolithic settlement on the Channel Islands and the longest continuous sequence of Neolithic archaeology from the Outer Hebrides. Perhaps our most significant single finding was a large collection of Mesolithic (immediately pre-Neolithic) flint tools in Scilly: these were not like types found in southern England, but rather those normally associated with northern France and Belgium. This suggests, very surprisingly, that there must have been Mesolithic maritime links down the entire length of the Channel, revealing that people were more mobile and travelled longer distances across the sea than archaeologists have previously realised. 

Our oceanographic modelling also provided some very important results - suggesting for example that Jersey was connected to France for up to 4000 years longer than Guernsey, and that the Isles of Scilly were actually one island until the Iron Age. Our extensive radiocarbon dating programme (incorporating over 300 dates) has transformed our appreciation of the chronology of the Earliest Neolithic within the western seaways zone.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Stepping Stones project has undeniably raised the profile of prehistoric archaeology on all five island groups. We anticipate that, as a result, more research projects will be undertaken there in future; one example includes our own work in 2016 on Neolithic islet sites on the Isle of Lewis, Outer Hebrides. The project as a whole successfully highlighted the potential that these island groups offer; further work is required in order to make them directly comparable with the mainlands either side.

Our dating programme highlighted the potential that a future dating project focused on tombs would have. In addition, our recovery of continental European microliths on Scilly has raised wide interest in a project (potentially both museums and fieldwork-based) looking for comparable assemblages along the south coast of England. Our sea level models will represent the 'gold standard' for archaeological mapping for the foreseeable future; these will be used for heritage management purposes and research.

Finally, we feel strongly that the project has demonstrated the tremendous potential that projects which integrate 'hard' archaeological science (modelling) with humanities-based questions. We hope that others will be inspired to undertake comparable integrated projects in future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0AD52CFD-87B2-45BB-9F89-1601F2769A6D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including
