Beauty Sector</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M004031/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Despite efforts to raise awareness of the challenges of sustainable development and environmental issues, individual behaviour has been slow to change. The proposed Knowledge Exchange study is based on the results of a previous study that explored the efficacy of an innovative bottom-up social marketing approach to encourage pro-environmental behaviour, using hairdressers as 'catalytic individuals' to diffuse knowledge relating to responsible chemical, energy and water use across their social networks. Social psychological research and research into behaviour change indicate that a key driver of behaviour is social norms. However even when people are aware of what they should do (injunctive norms) a stronger driver of behaviour is descriptive norms i.e. what everyone else is doing. Therefore, attempts to change behaviour need to take into account social norms. In our original study we targeted hairdressers on the basis that they talk to more people than almost any other occupation and therefore are in a strong position to affect norms relating to hair care. 
Hairdressers use a lot of energy, water and chemicals, but our research last year indicated that, despite the increased concerns and public pronouncements on the importance of sustainability, little awareness has filtered into the hairdressing sector. This lack of attention to environmental issues by hairdressers then constitutes a social norm that is antagonistic to sustainability awareness, especially hair-washing, drying and colouring, which are activities that are carried out at home. In our original study we found that once their awareness had been raised, hairdressers were motivated to adapt their practices to reduce energy, water and product use and decrease waste. There was also a demonstrated increase in the awareness of environmentally friendly hair care practices among the customers of hairdressers that participated in our study. Thus our research indicated that raising awareness of more environmentally friendly hair care practices can not only reduce the environmental impact of the hairdressing sector as a whole, but also presents a powerful means of developing more pro-environmental social norms relating to use of energy, water and toxic chemicals for the general population. 
As part of our original research, we ran a number of 'Green Salon Makeover' workshops for hairdressers. Key issues identified from these workshops included: the potential to make resource efficiency savings within the salon, ideas on products and practices that can enable salons to reduce their energy, water and product use, and how to engage, incorporate and promote sustainability aspects to clients and across the sector more generally. Although our original study demonstrated the efficacy of engaging hairdressers in pro-environmental behaviours, its impact was limited due to the relatively small sample size we were able to access. Thus to maximise impact and embed relevant environmental knowledge across the sector, the proposed knowledge exchange scheme aims to train the trainers. Specifically, to pass on the knowledge gained to trainers in UK hairdressing colleges, trainers for large salon chains and at industry events. This will involve working with organisations that develop and award hairdressing qualifications such as VTCT and City and Guilds.
Such knowledge exchange activities will benefit VTCT and City and Guilds by helping them to adapt their current hairdressing courses and awards to include environmental aspects. Salons who have been trained to consider environmental aspects can gain cost benefits from reduced resource use, and health benefits from reduced use of toxic chemicals. Similarly, clients exposed to more efficient hair care practices (e.g. washing just once, using less shampoo/dry shampoo, drying less, more easy care hairstyles etc.) make energy and cost savings. The corresponding reductions in energy use also helps the government meets its emissions targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Direct beneficiaries will include trainers, colleges, salon chains and hairdressers. The knowledge exchange activities will provide the knowledge and skills required by this sector to incorporate sustainability issues into their teaching, training and work practices. 

As one training college can affect thousands of hairdressers, and one hairdresser can affect thousands of customers, such knowledge exchange activities ensure cascading of knowledge and information on environmental issues to apprentices and future salon owners, and onto their clients leading to behaviour change within this sector (and in domestic practices) towards a low carbon economy. Statistics provided by HABIA (2011/12) provide an indication of the size of the targeted audience for the GSM project: the hair and beauty industry represents 5% of UK GDP, with approximately 55,000 salons and 420 million client visits per annum.

-Hairdressing salons will benefit as follows: 
-Cost savings due to reduced electricity usage, water consumption, and hair products. 
-Health benefits from switching to greener products, for example salons that switched to organic products in our original study reported immediate cessation of problems such as dermatitis. 
-Access to eco-friendly innovations (e.g.biodegradable towels, thermal caps that replace the need for blow drying, organic products, water-flow restrictors, efficient shower heads).
-Learning new skills, such as speed blow-drying that minimise energy use, and sharing expertise related to easy care hairstyles that minimise need for product use and blow-drying/hair straightening. 
-Increased publicity and clientele confidence for businesses with green credentials. The hairdressers in our original study welcomed the opportunity to gain environmental certification, not just to publicise their commitment in this area, but also as a means to raise the status of the profession as a whole. Being seen as a professional adds to the perceived value of the service hairdressers provide with corresponding business benefits.

The project partners, VTCT, City and Guilds and My HairDressers.com (MHD) will benefit as follows:
VTCT and City and Guilds perceive a growing market need for qualifications and continuous professional development relating to environmental issues within the sector and thus perceive benefits to partnering with the University to build upon the knowledge outcomes of our original study. MHD perceive marketing benefits and benefits to brand reputation from being involved with a government funded University led project. This proposal also benefits the key industry bodies, (HABIA, The Hairdressing Council and NHF) in their efforts to raise the legitimacy of the hairdressing sector by establishing more responsible standards of practice.

General public: Our research showed that informing hairdressers about pro-environmental behaviours affects the advice they pass onto their clients and their clients' subsequent behaviours. Thus there is potential for this project to develop norms of hair care that are much less resource intensive. Hair products and heat are generally bad for the hair, energy bills and the environment, so developing hair-care practices that use less product, less energy and less water benefits clients hair condition, clients' energy bills and the environment. 
Government: This research also helps the Government meet carbon-reduction targets by enabling the hairdressing sector to reduce their environmental impact and perpetuating more pro-environmental norms to the general population. For example, the energy costs of hairdryers are typically 10-20 times that of appliances such as televisions and computers, and water heaters are typically 50 times more than such appliances. Therefore the reductions in energy use achievable from encouraging less frequent hair-washing, one rather than two shampoos, less hair drying/straightening and alternatives such as dry shampoo are enormous.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95736</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As a resource for hairdressing trainers we filmed a series of videos about sustainable hair products and how to pass on sustainable hair care advice to clients.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0B90CB56-AAFE-474E-8EB4-7A8CAAAE2DF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We extend our impact to the whole UK population by showing role-play videos to demonstrate how to give advice to clients, and how to suggest products/practices that reduce energy/water/product use to them in typical client conversations (e.g. on camping holiday, try dry shampoo, short of time, try leave-in conditioner, saves extra rinse, short of money, reduce hot water use by shampooing just once etc) http://ecohairandbeauty.com/videos/</gtr:impact><gtr:title>video training resource</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvt5Fa3n-1Qd-Ni4sYnTlJQ</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Hair Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hair Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>AE6CFCC3-9546-4E65-A31B-E0336AF8AD30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publicity and dissemination of materials.

As one training college can affect thousands of hairdressers, and one hairdresser can affect thousands of customers, such knowledge-exchange activities ensure cascading information on environmental issues to apprentices and future salon owners leading to behaviour change within this sector towards a low carbon economy. The hairdressing sector has an annual turnover of &amp;pound;6.2 billion, and employs 0.87% of the total workforce, with 54,939 salons (Habia 2012). By targeting the training and award of qualifications, we are sending a powerful message to this industry, which equates to 5% of UK's GDP. 

Method
We held bespoke sustainability workshops and also tagged onto existing CPD events and industry events to educate the sector about more sustainable products and practices.
Our events so far constituted the following:
?City and Guilds: 14 events (total 400 trainers)
?VTCT CPD 8 events: 460 trainers
?Tea with Habia 3 events: 75 trainers
?14 Ecohair and beauty workshops: (500 attendees) 
?Large events for industry professionals: Pro-Beauty, Pro-hair live, Scottish Beauty, Natural Beauty, Hair and Beauty.

Dissemination and engagement and spread of impacts:
Impacts affect trainers, salons, hairdressers, their clients and the general public. Habia estimate there are 420 million client visits p.a. By our focus on teaching trainees the impact their advice can have on the public, we substantially increase the reach of our impact e.g. see our advice to clients video http://ecohairandbeauty.com/videos/ 

Challenges
In our original ESRC-funded research (2012/13)'Engaging Hairdressers in Pro-Environmental Behaviours' (ES/J010375/1), we established that once engaged, hairdressers were keen to learn sustainable hairdressing practices. However, a major challenge was getting hairdressers to come to our sustainability events in the first place. Thus we obtained funds as part of ESRC's knowledge exchange fund: 'Embedding Sustainability in the Hairdressing Curriculum - Sustainable Solutions for the Hair &amp;amp; Beauty Sector' (Nov 2014-May 2016).
Another challenge for this project was trying to find a balance between staying within hairdressers' comfort zones and not suggesting any changes that may alienate them (e.g. reducing product use) and achieving as much sustainable behaviour change as we could. We found there were usually win-win scenarios as most changes we suggested also saved money and time and were good for hair condition. However, there were occasions where suggestions were not well received. To help us make such decisions we involved hairdressers, trainers and industry experts in devising our sustainability certificate and training materials and constantly updated these to ensure that we were introducing new and relevant information but were avoiding alienating them by pushing too hard. 

Impacts
We have calculated impacts in terms of a triple bottom line approach taking into account social, environmental and economic value. 

Environmental value: 
This research helps meet carbon-reduction targets by enabling the hairdressing sector to reduce environmental impact and promote sustainable hair-care to clients. Running hot water is typically the most energy-intensive domestic activity and hair-care constitutes a significant proportion of hot water use: the weekly carbon-footprint of shampooing hair daily with two shampoos and rinsed-out conditioner with hot water running for 10 minutes is 9kg. Whereas the weekly carbon-footprint of shampooing twice a week with one shampoo and leave-in conditioner supplemented by one dry shampoo (total 4 mins hot-water running time), is 1kg. This equates to energy savings of about 936 kWh p.a. per person. 
Our post-workshop surveys indicate that trainers teach an average of 113 trainees pa. We recommended many products/practices that reduce number of rinse cycles but using dry shampoo as an example, trainers believed that, as a result of their changed focus in teaching, 50% are likely to promote dry shampoo to clients (assume 1900 clients pa), and 34% of clients would take this up. Each person who uses dry shampoo once a week saves about 6 minutes running-water time and 10 minutes hair-drying which saves 44.2 kg per person (0.044 MtCO2e); 96 kWh electricity and 4030 litres of water pa (1205x0.50x0.34x1900.044) equating to savings of 17125 metric tons of CO2 per year. See http://ecohairandbeauty.com/the-carbon-footprint-and-energy-costs-of-shampoo-and-hair-care-routines/ for assumptions.

Social Value: 
Well-being: Using less heat, water and product improves hair condition. This is not a trivial impact as hair matters greatly to many, especially those who are economically disadvantaged, with research showing that those in the poorest areas spend a disproportionately large percentage of their income on their image e.g. women in poorest slums of S Africa typically spend a third of their limited income on their hair (Knight 2012)
Health benefits from switching to greener products: e.g. salons that switched to organic products reported cessation of problems such as dermatitis. 
This project benefits the key industry bodies, (HABIA, The Hairdressing Council and NHF) in their efforts to raise the legitimacy of the hairdressing sector by establishing more responsible standards of practice.

Economic value: 
On individuals: We expect individual taking up our suggestion will save about &amp;pound;100. 
On hairdressing salons: Cost savings due to reduced electricity usage, water consumption, and hair products (calculate &amp;pound;1300 pa for typical small salon). For example, using tepid water, rather than hot water and removing one three-minute rinse cycle (e.g. shampooing clients hair once rather than twice, or using leave-in conditioner rather than rinse-out conditioner) saves about 4p per minute x 3 minutes x 20 customers a day x 350 days per year = &amp;pound;840 saving for a small salon from water-savings and &amp;pound;567 savings on electricity from this behavioural change alone. 
?Access to eco-friendly innovations (e.g. biodegradable towels, thermal caps that replace blow drying, organic products, water-flow restrictors, efficient shower heads).
?Learning new skills, such as speed blow-drying that minimise energy use, and sharing expertise related to easy-care hairstyles that minimise need for product use and blow-drying/hair straightening. 
?Increased publicity for businesses with green credentials. Salons welcomed the opportunity to gain environmental certification to publicise their commitment in this area and also to raise the status of the profession as a whole. Being seen as a professional adds to the perceived value of the service hairdressers provide with corresponding business benefits. Thus an important outcome for the salons has been the professionalization of their practice via their engagement with these standards and issues. We have provided an Ecohair and beauty certificate for attendance at our events, and these can be redeemed for a sustainable stylist/salon certificate by the Hair Council (stylist) and NHF (salon) if presented in conjunction with a self-certification statement or evidence of completion of an online sustainable hairdressing training package we have produced. NHF and NAEFSS will develop a list of all certified salons and promote to eco-minded clients, thus creating a competitive advantage for certified sustainable salons. 
. On project partners, VTCT, City and Guilds and My Hairdressers.com (MHD): VTCT and City and Guilds perceive a growing market need for qualifications and continuous professional development relating to environmental issues within the sector and benefited from partnering with the University to integrate knowledge outcomes into their training materials. MHD perceive marketing benefits and benefits to brand reputation from being involved with a government funded University led project. 
. Suppliers: This project has helped to introduce innovative new services and products that increase sustainability and resource efficiency, for example, innovative shower-heads that save water in a salon, pumps that dispense less shampoo, portable thermal caps that replace large hood dryers at salons, etc. This has paved the way for new companies and new inward investment. Although suppliers were reluctant to give exact figures due to confidentiality issues, since we began there has been an influx of more sustainable hair-care products and brands. Batiste has significantly expanded their range of dry shampoo - a product we have promoted due to the reduced need for water and electricity. Organic colour systems report an increased customer spend of 31% over the last 5 years and sales of eco-towels continue to grow.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F19C2C2C-D4C4-4621-9414-9E57EAC9A434</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. New knowledge generated: in the post-workshop surveys completed by trainers who had been to our eco-hair workshops and presentations, we asked them what was the most motivating factor to adopt more sustainable practices. Their responses contribute useful new knowledge on key motivators for pro-environmental behaviour. We also asked about their pre-existing environmental values which enables us to separate results so we can see if the key motivators for those who were already had pro-environmental values differ from those who did not hold strong pro-environmental values. Our results indicate that the best motivators overall (N= 157) are cost (M=1.62), and joint second: dislike of waste, effects on the environment and desire to adopt professional standards (M=1.69) (M=1.71), third was effects on hair condition (M=1.75), then health and safety aspects (M=1.77) complying with Habia standards (M= 1.82), time-saving (M=1.93), and feeling empowered to make a difference (M=1.98). 
But the most useful knowledge is what motivates those who are not already eco-minded. When we run the analysis just using those who did not already have sustainable values, then we find that all motivators are less powerful than for the eco-minded respondents, but the most important motivators for sustainable hairdressing were desire to hold professional standards (M=1.75), effects on the environment (M =1.82) and cost savings (M=1.86).

Additionally we have drawn on secondary sources to identify the carbon footprint of various hair-care practices and used this information to show hairdressers how various behavioural changes or new products/technologies can save electricity, water, waste, time and money. This information is fed into our other resources (see http://ecohairandbeauty.com/resources/) such as our carbon footprint of haircare report, virtual salon, quiz and PowerPoint presentation (e.g. http://ecohairandbeauty.com/carbon-footprint-calculator).

2. New skills developed: results from our survey of trainers (N=273) indicates that a substantial minority of trainers did not currently teach sustainability in theory lessons (31%) or practical lessons (22%). Nearly half believed their learners leave unaware of broad environmental issues or those relevant to the hairdressing sector (38%) upon completion of current hair qualifications. Only half believed that trainees qualify with the understanding to repeat pro-environmental behaviour in the salon. Thus our workshops were useful to give trainers the skills and knowledge to incorporate sustainability into their teaching. Our post-workshop feedback survey indicates that over 93% said they will give greater focus to sustainability as a result of our workshop (41% substantial increase, 53% some increase, 6% no change). 

3. New networks/research collaborations: in the course of our project we have collaborated with Boots, Unilever and Severn Water Board to share knowledge on hair-care and showering practices and carbon footprint calculations. We have also worked with industry bodies such as VTCT, City &amp;amp; Guilds, My hairdressers.com (MHD), the Hair Council and National Hair Federation to seek their input into our suggestions and materials and also to disseminate our materials via their networks.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Over the last 17 months we have been building up the resources on our website www.ecohairandbeauty.com so it provides a complete source of educational materials for hairdressing colleges to draw upon to integrate sustainability into their teaching. The website includes a carbon footprint of hair-care calculator, a quiz, a short and long PowerPoint presentation, links to training videos, articles, reports etc. VTCT is a market leader for the hairdressing industry and a leading Government approved awarding organisation offering vocationally related qualifications within the Hair &amp;amp; Beauty sector. They supported the project with a donation of &amp;pound;12000 and staff time and will take over management of the website once the project ends. 

In addition, we are creating a bespoke certificate for sustainable hairdressing based on completion of an online training course (ready April 2016) using a virtual salon and/or attendance at one of our eco hair and beauty workshops, plus (for salons) a self-certificate indicating what sustainable practices they currently engage in or plan to do within a certain date see http://ecohairandbeauty.com/virtual-salon-first-draft/. The Sustainable Stylist certification will be delivered by the Hair Council and the Sustainable Salon certificate will be delivered by the National Hair Federation. 
Lastly we are working with Severn Water Board on how our materials can be used/disseminated by them to minimise water use among their customers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BA4C2F5E-D59A-462B-849C-D2CDB77F6339</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ecohairandbeauty.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Integration of sustainability into National Occupational Standards for Hair and Beauty sector</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F4274240-EB3A-48CD-9095-974058FADD30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sustainability practices have been included in all technical units within the new National Occupational Standards for hairdressing and beauty (2015). For example as a result of our research and input they now no longer recommend shampooing twice as the default recommendation, and now recommend shampooing once as the default, and twice only if the hair type/condition demands it. This effectively cuts the carbon footprint, energy and water consumption associated with hair-washing by almost half, saving time and money and reducing water pollution as well as energy and water savings. This also has positive health and safety implications as many shampoos contain harsh, toxic ingredients so reduced shampoo use reduces risk of skin complaints and improves hair condition in most cases.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.habia.org/standards-qualifications/national-occupational-standards-nos</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>All party political group on the hair industry</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C59ABD19-E2EE-40FB-86B3-3419ABC9CE9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There is an All Party Political Group including John McNally (MP) as Chair, and Vice Chairs Christina Rees (MP), Jeremy Lefroy (MP) Liz Saville Roberts (MP) and Liz McInnes MP which meets regularly with industry stakeholders to discuss professionalisation and regulation of the hair industry. Our research was referred to in previous meetings and I was a key speaker at the last meeting on 1st March 2016 which focussed specifically on sustainability in the hair industry and included a talk also by Doug Clarke (Growth and Water-efficiency manager) Severn Trent Water, and attendees from key industry bodies such as the directors of the Hair Council, the National Hair Federation, VTCT and eco-suppliers in the field.
We discussed our proposed sustainable salon/stylist certification and how our research and materials can be used to encourage less resource-intensive washing and hair-care practices. Key questions on the agenda were:
? How can these ideas work in practice?
? What can the Government do to promote these ideas?
? How can hairdressers reconcile these environmental priorities with profitability?
? How can hairdressers ensure quality and sustainability?
? How might registration help sustainability?</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>new sustainability units in hairdresser training</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D867D8DF-0C98-408D-A9A3-C2CCF794FF8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>VTCT is one the leading awarding organisation for the hair and beauty sector and as a result of this project now include sustainability in their NVQs. The shampooing and conditioning unit content/indicative list that supports the unit within the VTCT record of assessment books now makes reference to only shampooing once as the default (changed from shampooing twice 2014/5). During training events that VTCT deliver with educators from the hair and beauty sector they now always draw their attention to our website www.ecohairandbeauty.com and the resources available on it to help them deliver sustainable hairdressing training to their learners.
VTCT are currently drawing on our findings and resources to provide learners with a qualification certificate that has a sustainability kitemark for those who have achieved an NVQ qualification in hair or beauty. Since 2015 VTCT now also insist that learners studying for an NVQ have to demonstrate sustainability practices as they work and achieve their qualification. 
Similarly City and Guilds now include sustainability and environmental awareness as a key aspect trainers now have to integrate into their teaching. They use the sustainability video we developed with MyHairdressers.com as part of this process.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Development of sustainable stylist and sustainable salon certification</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D818E174-8B2B-4A24-9389-1C6F5EEFC227</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have had over 500 stylists/trainees complete our virtual salon.

An analysis of feedback of those who completed the virtual salon gives more information:

SUSTAINABLE STYLIST SURVEY. SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF FEEDBACK FROM THE VIRTUAL SALON 1.2.2017

Sample: 324 respondents, mostly trainees (n = 177) and trainers (n = 70) with a mix of others (salon owners, hairdressers, unspecified). 

Training: Most of these had little (n= 158) or no (n= 74) training in sustainability of hair-care. 64 had attended a training event at college and 11 had attended one of our eco-workshops 

ECOTIPS
 What eco-tips had most useful information/advice. Which aspects were most inspirational? (we added up text responses and summarised in table below)
Disposable Towels 24 comments Laundering towels as this is a big problem within the college. Broken machines, funding for washing powder, labour to maintain towels etc. Interesting that disposable towels were a much cheaper option. This is something I will pass on to the college management.

Water saving e.g. technologies etc. 23 comments The different shower head and cleansing conditioner are useful things to know.
Wash hair less 18 comments I learned to not wash your hair every day and to wash it every other day. Also, I learned to wash your hair with one shampoo and not two.

All Useful 18 comments
One wash not two 17 comments I found the washing tips most useful to inform clients. The fact they may not need a second shampoo or that they may not need to use conditioner all the time, and that leave in conditioner is just as good.
Energy Saving 15 comments advice on LED Lightbulbs
Money 14 comments
Dry Shampoo 13 comments 
Palm Oil 12 comments
Leave-in conditioner 12 comments Not washing your hair as much and using dry shampoos and leave in conditioners
Organic/eco-friendly products 10 comments
Less Shampoo 9 comments 
Tepid Water 7 comments 
Carbon Footprint 7 comments 
Star Rated Electricals 5 comments 
Advice to clients 2 comments I found that the video of 8 minutes was very helpful and it makes me understand about the environment more. The ones about washing the hair and how to save water and to reduce the energy bills are very helpful and I will put these tips to use when I am in my house. I will also try to use the tips on dry shampoo and the leave in conditioner because I colour my hair very frequently and I will find these helpful for me

Tip Frequency Typical quote
No 109 comments No there weren't any eco tips that I disagreed on and wouldn't use.

Disposable Towels 14 comments disposable towels - clients do not like them

One wash not two 5 comments Shampooing is an enjoyable, relaxing experience and is part of the service. I would worry that my clients would feel I am rushing them through the service. I would certainly offer them a massage as an alternative if it is suitable for the client's hair type. Often it is evident that two shampoos are not required and in this case I would be prepared to only offer one.

Dry Shampoo 5 comments Leave- in conditioner / dry shampoo not suitable for all hair types and can themselves cause more hair problems if used too often or incorrectly

Leave-in conditioner 4 Not sure on the use of only leave in conditioners as I have always understood that combing through conditioner close down the cuticle to help make it shiny.

Reducing waste 1

 The section on wasted left over colouring products. Stating the correct method of disposal. But it clearly states the benefits.

Washing up less frequently 1 
Curling without heat 1 
Hair Chalk 1 
Palm Oil 1

 I would say that it is best to advise against the use of palm oil completely, as the plantations are just ones in areas where the deforestation has already occurred, and so are preventing the deforestation of that area
