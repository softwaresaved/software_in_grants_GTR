Many primary causes of death are now no longer direct results of spinal cord injury but are conditions linked to age and inactivity. This means that there are long-term demands on medical support; in particular, treatment of osteoporotic bone fractures often results in lengthy spells in hospital for individuals with spinal cord injury. It is therefore important to minimize the effect of osteoporosis after spinal cord injury; this highlights the need for exercise programmes to target bone health. The proposed research aims to develop effective Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) induced weight bearing exercises to improve and maintain bone health in the lower extremities of spinal cord injury patients. 

The type of exercises proposed will be completed using a novel smart standing frame and FES system to cyclically activate different sets of muscles whilst maintaining standing and crouch poses. The hypothesis is that these exercises will induce sufficient joint contact forces to be beneficial for bone health in the ankle, knee and hip joints. Using biomechanical modelling software an optimal combination of these exercises will be sought in order to design a rehabilitation programme to target bone health. 

To be beneficial to bone health, these exercises need to be repeated several times a week and there is a good chance patients will get bored or frustrated doing the same thing every day. To solve this problem, rehabilitation aids will be developed to keep patients motivated. These aids will use video game technology (based on the Xbox Kinect), to make the sessions more engaging for the patient to encourage compliance and give a sense of achievement. This will also allow the patient and clinician to monitor the progress of a rehabilitation programme and modify it as necessary.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will develop a device to counteract the osteoporosis that occurs in the pelvis and the lower extremities of spinal cord injury patients. Osteoporotic bone fractures significantly increase the risk of mortality but a dependable, simple to use system that enables safe and reliable maintenance of bone health has yet to be developed. Further societal benefits of such a system lie in the increased functional capability and independence of spinal cord injury patients that would result from decreasing the risk of fracture during everyday activities such as wheelchair transfer. 

Economic benefits to such a system are closely related to the societal benefits. Figures from spinal cord injury charities give the UK current annual cost of caring for people paralysed by spinal cord injury at more than &amp;pound;500 million. Treatment of osteoporotic bone fractures often results in lengthy spells in hospital for individuals with spinal cord injury. The use of the proposed system to maintain bone health would therefore not only offer the societal benefit of reducing the frequency of hospital visits but would reduce health care costs and the demand on hospitals. 

A further societal benefit is to be gained by using video game technology to deliver the exer-gaming system. Playing games that require weight bearing exercises to be performed will make the rehabilitation sessions enjoyable and allow the user to track their progress, giving a sense of achievement. There is a need for more exer-gaming to be targeted with specific exercises for specific patient groups, this research has the potential to form the basis of a future programme for spinal cord injury patients.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>708302</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Generic Robotics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Smart frame Technologies</gtr:description><gtr:id>2D793537-F3D1-499E-8AC6-41CD240C6B88</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Suitable smart frame technologies have been developed with generic robotics leading to an operational fall arrest and measurement system located at UoR.

Performance and parameters (output voltage, output current) were comparable to commercially available stimulators (4 channel Odstock Medical Limited, UK).</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F6B3723-BE21-4D41-A7D0-338DA24FE0E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This development has led to further collaboration with Odstock Medical Limited.</gtr:impact><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>UoR 16 Channel Controllable Functional Electrical Stimulator</gtr:title><gtr:type>Therapeutic Intervention - Medical Devices</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2015</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>A smart frame for paraplegic subjects to stand a perform load shifting movements was completed. This movements will allow paraplegic subjects to subject their joints to high transient forces that, if repeated consistently will allows to improve bone health. This frame has force plates, side bars with load cells which allow to record forces when in use. Additionally, the frame has an electronic winch that attaches to a harness to help subject to stand. The harness and winch also serves as a safety mechanism to prevent falls.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EC4B0C43-A567-4ACE-8CDB-D3081494D6F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This novel standing frames allow safe active standing while recording forces.

In this topic we have carried out the following work:
1. We have done extensive tests with one paraplegic subject highly experienced in FES. These tests have provided us with data of SCI subject to compare with able bodies and to validate the results from developed models.
2. Using inverse dynamics, muscle activation for each movement was analysed for able bodies and for paraplegic subjects. 
3. From previous analysis it was concluded that the use of optimization functions should be adapted to better model what happens in spinal cord injury motions. In order to do this, different ways of finding non-redundant set of muscles to perform the predefined set of movements is being investigated.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB352B97-A59B-478F-AEB7-5634EF4FA73B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This will allow to understand the effect of different motions and exercises in spinal cord injury subjects.

These forces were measured through force plates while SCI subjects perform load-bearing exercises. 

The bone mass indicators (cortical and trabecular area), diaphyseal design (cortical and trabecular thickness, moment of inertia) and material quality (bone mass density) were obtained from pQCT scans from an SCI subject. The stress and strain distribution was obtained by approximating this data to geometric values of one SCI subject and applying forces (obtained from exercises performed by SCI subject) in the ankle joint.

Currently, we are preparing to perform more scans (pQCT), to collect data from other subjects and validate the model.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4CE49BE7-1CCB-4CB2-A0BB-7F0E602533C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a non-invasive model that will allow planning a set of exercises routines that will ultimately produce homogeneous bone mass increase across all sections of the bones of the lower limb.
