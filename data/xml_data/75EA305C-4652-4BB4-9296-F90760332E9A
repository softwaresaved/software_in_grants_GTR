Borders</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J013471/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>What happened when the UK TV series The Office was adapted for French audiences as Le Bureau? Or when Vishal Bhardwaj adapted Othello in the Bollywood musical Omkara? Or when the Tomb Raider video game had to be altered significantly for the Japanese market? 

The Media Across Borders research network explores the myriad ways in which media content is translated and adapted across cultural borders. The network will bring together academic scholars and industry professionals, with the objective to deepen understanding of these processes of media content adaptation and to consider the broader significance of cultural translation within the creative industries. It will take up its work with two one-day workshops focused on the ways in which the film, television and video game industries adapt content for a variety of national contexts and media platforms. The two workshops will be followed by an international conference, aimed at widening the debate to include more media and to open up the network to a broader range of participants. 

The research development network aims to model a new approach to the translation of ideas from one culture to another, defined above all in terms of language and locality (national, regional, local), but also taking into account fan cultures and different genre and media cultures with their distinct historically developed conventions. The network seeks to reveal and understand the cultural particularities of the various adaptations while simultaneously noting what is shared. Taking a holistic and anti-reductionist approach, the network will pay close attention to the diverse and complex ways in which media content travels the globe and is appropriated locally by producers, marketing teams and fan audiences. Drawing on international academic expertise, the network aims to offer a fresh perspective on contemporary digital media that looks beyond the national context to consider global popular culture and the transnational implications of media content adaptation. 

Interest in media adaptation, both in the media industries and in academia, is growing: Articles in trade journals, and seminars concerned with the franchising of media content at major industry events have increased manifold in recent years. New technologies and the ongoing consolidation in the media industries have led to an enormous growth in the exchange of cultural artefacts across borders, particularly in the form of franchised media content sold for adaptation. In our digitalized, globalized world innovative and audience-drawing media productions are 'discovered' ever more quickly and reworked on a growing scale for worldwide distribution and consumption. 

Given the central importance of the international market to the creative industries, our research has the potential to build a productive dialogue between industry and the academy. Locally adapted television formats, including shows such as Big Brother, Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? and Deal or No Deal, generated global revenues of EUR 9.3bn between 2006 and 2008. More than a third of this money went to British production companies (J&amp;auml;ger and Behrens, The Frapa Report, 2009). A large scale analysis of German and US television schedules revealed that over 30% of primetime programming of the large national networks consisted of formatted programming (Esser, 2010). The mobile and home video game sectors are worth more than $100 billion (PWC, 2011), and global industry trends suggest the localisation business will continue to increase. 

Building on these events, this network will evolve into an ongoing international forum for the exploration of the intricacies of content adaptation and the potential benefits and limitations it can have in both economic and cultural terms.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the Media Across Borders research development network can be gauged in economic and societal terms. In particular it aims to benefit the creative industries, for which the adaptation of media content has become a daily business, by 
1. Aiming to enhance the knowledge and skills of companies and organisations involved in the adaptation business through workshops; establishing a growing and lasting research network; developing a toolkit for the translation and adaptation of media content that will be made freely available on the network's website; offering other valuable material and links on the website; and through the grant holders' offer to participate in industry events and trade publications. 
2. Helping to enhance the efficiency, performance and sustainability of businesses involved in media adaptation. Findings, where applied by companies, should help both media production and translation companies to adapt media content more successfully. This will increase company revenues and achieve long-term sustainability.
3. Contributing toward wealth creation and economic prosperity in the UK. For the British creative industries this research is of particular relevance. As an industry strand of strategic importance to the country, the British media industries are already in a good position: The UK is historically strong in international trade; has the advantage of the global dominance of the English language; the country has a mature media industry, the biggest in the world as a portion of GDP, directly employing 1.1 million people; a large creative talent pool and a good reputation; and a well-developed distribution infrastructure. In recent years Britain has developed into one of the world's most advanced digital TV markets and the world's most successful exporter of franchised television programmes, including Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor. As a result it accounted for over 33% of global revenues from the format business in 2008 (J&amp;auml;ger and Behrens, The Frapa Report, 2009) and has produced some major production and distribution companies operating at the international level (e.g. All3Media, Fremantle). In the video games sector it has been successful with original new Intellectual Property for games such as Fable, Little Big Planet, SingStar and Buzz. Supporting these areas of new strengths will enhance business revenue and innovative capacity and lead to the further creation and growth of companies and jobs. 

Overall, the network thus hopes to produce substantial economic benefits for those stakeholders within the UK that have an interest in capacities of cultural translation and adaptation and are looking for skills gaps in this area to be filled.
 
In the academic field, the network hopes to have economic impact by 
1. Increasing chances to attract R&amp;amp;D investment from global business after the successful dissemination of the initial network findings. 
2. Generating revenue through the training of people for the translation and adaptation profession. For example, Roehampton University's MA in Audiovisual Translation is already popular amongst professionals, and evening seminars attract large numbers of both academics and practitioners. In addition, staff and students have generated revenue with translation and subtitling projects over the past four years. 

Finally, the research development network will have societal impact in that it 
1. Advances our understanding of cultural differences and similarities as well as problems of translation and cultural appropriation.
2. Helps policy makers with interest in culture, the creative industries and the media to build on the findings in regard to both cross-cultural and national (or regional and local) concerns.
3. Improve international relations through advanced understanding of cultural differences and similarities and enhanced skills in translation and cultural adaptation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23984</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Tampere</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Finland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Four-country audience research project on musical talent shows</gtr:description><gtr:id>F3F71163-2D84-4F27-B65E-F6447502DB16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>(Forthcoming, 2015) Co-authored with P.M.

Thirty-two academics and ten industry professionals debated the following topics in six workshops: TV Formats - Production &amp;amp; Distribution; Film Across Borders; Video Game Localisation; National Label, Global Brand; Researching Transnational Media; and The Translation of Audiovisual Media. (For more detail please see http://mediaacrossborders.com/?page_id=1255) The workshops, scheduled across two 1&amp;frac12;-hour timeslots with 11-17 participants each, were preceded and followed by organised networking opportunities, starting with a game of Rueda Cubana (a Spanish form of speed-dating) and ending with a joint dinner. Together these activities proved very effective, achieving a high quality and quantity of dialogue and networking.

The event helped build the network and gave participants, academics and industry participants, sufficient time to get acquainted and stay in touch afterwards. It proved a very effective tool for building a network, something a large conference could not have achieved.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://mediaacrossborders.com/?page_id=1255</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited speaker at industry conference for game professionals, academcis and students</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ABB49665-6E1A-4FB6-995B-D7535672D76E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Miguel Bernal-Merino was an invited speaker, talking about &amp;quot;Become a global contender!&amp;quot; at the Northern Game Summit, Kajaani University, in Finland. 26th September, 2014; a conference that attracted 450 game professionals, academics and students.

As such there have been few concrete 'research findings' emanating from the funded network's launch activities that could be 'used'. Talking to Creative Skill Set, an industry body for the creative industries and two other industry partners about potential research projects that would benefit the industry was the most important outcome from the two funded workshops. Talks are still ongoing. Other 'uses' of the network launch activities are that network members have been in constant contact sine 2012, exchanging information, discussing and initiating research collaborations, co-publishing network-related articles, editing books and special journal issues together, and bidding for national and international research grants. Contact with industry partners is ongoing, four of which participated in an industry keynote panel at the second Media Across Borders Conference, held in June 2015 at the University of Roehampton. In 2014 Andrea Esser was invited to act as an international consultant for a large grant from the Danish Research Council for a project entitled 'What Makes Danish TV Drama Series Travel?' (Aarhus University, 2014-2018). During her six months stay at Aarhus University she also gave a talk for Danish industry executives at CreativeMornings Aarhus, entitled Popular Culture in the Climate of Globalization' (27.2.15). In August 2016 she was invited by Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea, to give a talk on the global TV Format Trade during the Busan TV programme market and advise on their new industry-facing TV production programme (6-13 May). In September 2017 the University of Roehampton launched a new MA in Intercultural Communication in the Creative Industries. This MA is an outcome of the work of the Media Across Borders network and Roehampton's internationally recognised MAs in Audiovisual Translation (both Andrea Esser and Miguel Bernal-Merino are involved in this MA). In February 2017, one of Andrea Esser's journal articles, published in 2016 in the International Journal of Communication, 'Challenging U.S. leadership in entertainment television? The rise and sale of Europe's international TV production groups,' (special section 'Shift or Stasis: Questioning Global Communication Power,' 10, 3585-3614), was translated into German by empirical media journal Media Perspektiven, published by public service broadcaster ARD (http://tinyurl.com/zkpnoub). Upon publication Andrea Esser was invited to present her work to the German Chamber of Commerce.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D8B29D7E-607A-48A5-89C6-B38F0330C308</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In the five years of it existence the Media Across Borders network has confirmed its belief that the cultural adaptation ('localisation') of creative products is an increasing and necessary practice. In 2016 it published an edited collection to this end (Media Across Borders: Localising TV, Film and Video Games, Routledge), which includes theorisations of localisation, case studies and critical reflections. In September 2016, the University of Roehampton launched a new MA in Intercultural Communication in the Creative Industries, which focuses on the localisation of creative products (TV, film, games, advertising). The Media Across Borders anthology is the basis for one of the core modules. Individual findings are too numerous and complex to describe here. Please see individual publications for this.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Apart from the new MA and what students learn there, there are indications that policy makers and TV producers are interested in Andrea Esser's research, which has resulted from a conference invitation from Media Across Borders member Joe Khalil (Northwestern University, Qatar) and her recent collaboration with MAB member Jean Chalaby (a special issue on the TV Format Trade, including a single-authored article on the consolidation of the TV entertainment market and its impact on UK Tv production). The work has been read by several TV producers and policy makers in the UK, Germany and the US and has received praise.
