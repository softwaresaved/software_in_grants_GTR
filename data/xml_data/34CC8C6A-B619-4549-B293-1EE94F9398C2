Partly, this is due to the fact that the contour lines of their interface height converge in d=2 to Schramm's SLE - a family of random planar curves shown to be the universal scaling limit of many important two-dimensional lattice models in probability and statistical mechanics (2006 Fields Medal for Werner). Moreover, gradient models are connected to random interlacements, a novel probability area pioneered by Sznitman, to reinforced random walks, and to Liouville quantum gravity. 

Informally, the random interface is given by highly-dependent real-valued random variables whose distribution is a function of the nearest-neighbour interactions V of the interface. In the case with V a quadratic function, this distribution is a Gaussian measure - the Gaussian Free Field (GFF) - the d-dimensional time analog of Brownian motion.

The classic gradient model assumes a smooth medium, i.e. without disorder. However, most phenomena in nature exhibit some disorder due to impurities entering the systems or to materials which have defects or inhomogeneities. In this proposal, we will mainly explore the effects of disorder on continuous gradient models which is an almost unchartered territory mathematically. I will seek to answer questions such as whether the addition of a small amount of disorder modifies the nature of the phase transitions of the underlying homogeneous gradient model, i.e. if disorder is relevant, I will aim to identify non-standard phase transitions, to find new instances of universality behaviour, and to create connections between gradients and other models with disorder by taking questions from d=1 (polymers) to the next level d&amp;gt;1 (gradients), e.g. quenched vs annealed free energy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Applied Probability has always been driven by practical problems: ruin theory, introduced by Swedish actuary Filip Lundberg, uses probabilistic models to describe an insurer's vulnerability to insolvency/ruin, and statistical physics uses methods of probability theory and statistics to deal with large populations and approximations.
Modern challenges to probability and statistics are just as motivated by practical concerns such as the current need for statisticians to develop methods that are scalable to huge datasets, yet also flexible enough
to utilize data of different types and from different sources. In recognition of such challenges, the
EPSRC has identified Statistics and Applied Probability as an area that it wishes to grow further.
The UK has historically been at the forefront of statistics and probabilistic research, from Thomas Bayes, UCL's Karl Pearson, Geoffrey Grimmett etc. The study of interface models and of models with disorder is strongly represented in the UK, with among others, names such as Stefan Adams, David Croydon, Andrew Wade and Nikolaous Zygouras, experts whose research was recently funded by EPSRC. 

The
development of tools for gradient models with disorder will not only give rise to novel interesting mathematical behaviour, but will also ensure that the UK remains a leader in this field. Moreover, the programme reaches across other areas of probability, such as random polymer models, random walks in random environments, and has the potential of developing tools useful for models with disorder in general.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98385</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Max Planck Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Max Planck Institute</gtr:department><gtr:description>Applications to physics</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE8D800C-DB7C-41EB-A3E5-731DA770DC35</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There are 2 papers in preparation, with further planned projects after the current ones finish.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>My collaborators have brought to this proposal their expertise in theoretical and numerical analysis.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have brought to this collaboration my expertise in probability theory and statistical mechanics, as further developed and deepened by the current EPSRC grant.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public talks in high schools in the London area</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FDA30D8E-0409-4CF8-B0B4-F4442778CCFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The activity was to give a lay talk on my research to students at Blackheath High School.

The workshop was aimed at researchers interested in interdisciplinary approaches to studying the link between micro-and macrostructure in physical systems, with and without temperature. These approaches bring to the light new challenges in numerical models as well. The interplay of Analysis and Probability frameworks has been the source of success of such approaches and this was the leading theme of our conference. The workshop also had many informal discussions as well, with the wish to foster future successful interactions between these fields.

We had 18 invited speakers, 6 from probability theory, 6 from analysis and 6 from mathematical physics, who discussed various topics on gradient models and related models from probabilistic and analysis perspectives. Our speakers were world-wide experts in the field, who contributed numerous new exciting ideas and problems to the discussions.

As a result of the workshop, new collaborations were started between many of the participants. The PI herself has started two new projects in the area of the current grant with some of the leading invited experts.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakcco/events-feb-2017.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk in Toronto</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92C53A93-DC31-46F9-B6DF-91CB6EC0DA4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The activity was a talk at the World Congress in Probability and Statistics, to present my work to a broader non-specialist audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>13000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Royal Society International Exchanges Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Royal Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2D2A7136-94E6-46B6-B5BE-4D476325283D</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Gradient interface models are an important class of probability and statistical mechanics models arising from (i) the study of random interfaces, which are simplified physics models of phase transition, (ii) the harmonic crystal (Gaussian Free Field) (iii) elasticity (Cauchy-Born rule). Informally, the random interface is given by highly-dependent real-valued random variables whose distribution is a function of the nearest-neighbour interactions of the interface. In the case when the potential is a quadratic function, the distribution is a Gaussian
measure - the Gaussian Free Field (GFF) - the d-dimensional time analog of Brownian motion. 

One is interested in the universal features of gradient models, which translates probabilistically to studying the universality class of the GFF - to which the uniformly strictly convex potentials have been shown to belong. Another question of interest is to examine the boundaries of GFF universality, and to find interactions which do not belong to the GFF universality class. For non-convex interactions, many of the techniques used to prove results for strictly-convex potentials fail, and there are many open problems. Moreover, in addition to whether or not the potential belongs to the GFF universality class, an important second motivation comes from the Cauchy-Born rule in material sciences.

The classic gradient model assumes a smooth medium, i.e. without disorder. However, most phenomena in nature exhibit some disorder due to impurities entering the systems or to materials which have defects or inhomogeneities. These impurities may lead to a different macroscopic behaviour, for example a change in crystal structure potentially gives rise to elastic fields or may change the roughening phase transition. These features are taken into account by letting the medium be random. The challenges are then to (i) understand how/if randomness changes the main features of the model and (ii) reveal the universal attributes of this mechanism. 

In this proposal, we investigated the effects of disorder on continuous gradient models which is an almost unchartered territory mathematically. The main objective of the project was to explore for the first time the issue of disorder relevance of phase transitions for continuous gradient models with non-convex disordered potentials, notably on phase transitions and critical phenomena. In particular, the project aimed to analyse whether the disorder changes the behaviour of the interface near the critical points.

The first main result of the project concerned the question of uniqueness of non-convex gradient Gibbs measures in the presence of disorder. In work currently in-preparation, we showed that for a certain class of potentials at various temperatures, disorder changes the nature of the uniqueness phenomena compared to gradient models without disorder. More precisely, the phase transitions at moderate temperature between uniqueness/non-uniqueness of the gradient Gibbs measure disappears, and we have uniqueness at all temperatures for our class of non-convex potentials. 

A second on-going outcome of the proposal addresses the question of whether disorder shifts for non-convex potentials the critical points from the phase transitions between uniqueness/non-uniqueness of the gradient Gibbs measure.

A third novel outcome of this project is that the tools and ideas developed here provide insight and help into the study of gradient models with sub-gaussian potentials, for which very little is known up to now. This has given rise to a new collaboration on the topic, where the tools that we developed in our project with be applied in conjunction with the development of additional techniques.

In brief the project has delivered crucial steps towards understanding how non-convex interactions with disorder affect the important question of uniqueness of gradient Gibbs measures, and has led to the start of exciting follow-up projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has potential use in academic context. We were able to obtain results on gradient Gibbs measures with disorder and non-convex potentials. Moreover, our tools apply to a different class of gradient models than the ones investigated in this proposal, which class we will look at in the future. These results, together with our methods, may prove very useful to other researchers in the field of gradient models and in related areas.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ABF115E1-4E46-4CEA-B646-D8623361756C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M027694/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
