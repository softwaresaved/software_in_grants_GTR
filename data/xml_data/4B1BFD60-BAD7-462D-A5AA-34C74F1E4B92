The book is a critical reinvestigation of modernism and modernity from two deliberately eccentric standpoints: the twentieth-century history of the city of Prague, and the history of the surrealist movement during the same period. \nPrague's fractured twentieth-century history does not fit the grand narratives of progress that have dominated western accounts of what it is to be modern. Since 1918 the city has been the capital, successively, of a province of Austria-Hungary, the most easterly liberal democracy in interwar Europe, a Nazi-occupied Protectorate, a westerly outlier of the Soviet communist bloc, and a born-again democracy that is now integrated into both NATO and the EU. Its modernity encompasses a national liberation struggle leading to Czechoslovak independence in 1918, two foreign occupations, and several changes of borders and populations, including the Holocaust and the post-war expulsion of three million 'Germans.' Its inhabitants have lived under all three major political ideologies of the twentieth century: democracy, fascism and communism. This history has given rise to an art whose hallmarks include a suspicion of totalizing ideologies, a nose for irony and black humor, a taste for the absurd, close attention to the anomalies of the everyday, and a relish of the erotic. Such disenchanted responses to modernist promises are also characteristic of surrealist thought, whose most vibrant centre outside Paris has been, precisely, Prague. Andr&amp;eacute; Breton recognized a striking affinity between surrealism and the city, which he famously hailed as 'the magic capital of Old Europe.' I suggest, however, that it is Prague's modern history that makes it so uniquely conducive to surrealist ways of seeing.\nAll the Beauties of the World centrally engages with two questions: (1) does the surreality of Prague's twentieh-century history challenge our conventional western-centered understandings of modernity, and (2) does that challenge lend validity to surrealism's critique of modernist visions of what modernity is? These questions are explored through a narrative-montage that intertwines the histories of the city and the surrealist movement. A central strand of this story (which has been marginalized in much standard art history) is the relationship between avant-garde art and left-wing politics. A major focus of the book is on what the Czech novelist Milan Kundera calls 'the density of unexpected encounters': jarring juxtapositions that upset our expectations, requiring us (as surrealism also does) to rethink what is, and is not, part of the modern condition.\nThe book will contribute both to art history and criticism and to interdisciplinary theorizations of modernity (a topic that has been much discussed across disciplines in recent years). It will provide the fullest account yet published in English of Czechoslovak surrealism and of Czech artists' international avant-garde connections. This will remedy a serious deficiency in standard histories of surrealism. Unlike some other recent attempts to reintegrate Central Europe into the canon of modern art, I argue that to do so requires rethinking the principles upon which that canon is based, including the privileging of formal innovations. In this respect I extend recent critiques of modernist historiography and re-evaluations of the surrealist legacy within art history. As regards wider theorizations of modernity, my research will make its most original contribution (a) in adopting a vantage-point (Prague) that allows consideration of a variety of twentieth-century modernities, including fascism and communism, and (b) in making the case for surrealism's insights into the modern condition to be taken seriously. \n \</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34225</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C653DBEB-0AA6-4ED2-A64B-BFFCFD0E2BB0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prague, Capital of the Twentieth Century: A Surrealist History</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/46e20c8aed26d6dc24a503094a2ff6e4"><gtr:id>46e20c8aed26d6dc24a503094a2ff6e4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sayer Derek</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780691043807</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_47291196353bf2d84e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G005907/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
