We wish to analyze the critical copying machines - known as 'RNA polymerases' - in their natural surroundings. During the last fifty years, techniques have been developed to purify these copying machines from our cells, and we now have detailed maps both of their contents and structure. We also know they are part of a larger production line that carries out additional functions; for example, the major copying machine - polymerase II - is found with other machines that work on the RNA copies as they are made. We have shown that a number of these production lines are, in turn, organized into still-larger 'factories'. [We define a factory as a site containing at least two RNA polymerases copying different pieces of DNA, and the reason for having all factories is the same (whether they make cars, jam, or RNA) - to enhance production by concentrating relevant machines and raw materials in one place.] Unfortunately, these factories are so tightly bound to the substructure in the cell that hitherto they have been impossible to isolate (so we know little about their contents); fortunately, we have just developed a method that allows us to release them from the substructure (we use the enzymes the cell uses naturally when it commits suicide!), and this has enabled us to go on to partially purify the factories free of many other cellular components. We now want to exploit this method, and a related one for assaying which genes are being copied in the factories; we want to catalogue some of their contents using various techniques (including sequencing to determine DNA and RNA content, and light microscopy to map locations).
 
We are especially interested in comparing factories before and after they start copying particular sets of genes. To this end, we will use two natural agents that rapidly switch on copying of selected genes - tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb). [TNFa orchestrates our inflammatory response when our body becomes infected with microbes; it binds to the cell membrane and sends a messenger - NFkappaB - into the nucleus to switch on the copying of the genes that encode protective proteins. If the infection is mild, the system produces proteins able to fight it. But if severe, the cell may choose to commit suicide by activating those enzymes described above - so taking the infecting microbes with it to the grave. Clearly, the system has to make the right decision! TGFb sends a different messenger into the nucleus to switch on a different set of genes. As these genes control many cell functions involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, TGFb plays important roles in diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.] As both agents act so rapidly, we will add them to cells obtained from normal umbilical veins, switch on different groups of genes, purify the factories after 10-480 min, and compare their contents with those from untreated cells.

We also have a more ambitious aim. Human chromosomes are arguably the largest and most important biomolecules, and many aspects of their structure - and how structure affects function - remain obscure. This has practical consequences: for example, we cannot yet predict how active a gene will be when inserted into a new location, and this obviously limits the development of successful gene therapies. As a result, major questions of our age are: what is the 3D structure of the human chromosome, and how does that structure affect function? We suggest that the clustering of active genes into factories is one of the major architectural motifs; we hope this analysis will help prove or disprove whether this is so.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Human nuclei contain 3 RNA polymerases defined by the sets of genes they transcribe. Core activities of each polymerase have been purified and their structures determined. All are part of larger complexes (e.g., polymerase II is found with activities involved in capping, splicing, and polyadenylation), and we have shown these are organized into still larger 'factories'. [We define a factory as a site containing at least 2 polymerases engaged on different templates, and the reason for having all factories is the same: to enhance production by concentrating relevant machines and raw materials in one place.] Hitherto, it has been impossible to isolate factories as they are so tightly bound to the underlying structure. As caspases deconstruct nuclei during apoptosis in vivo, we reasoned they might release factories in vitro - and this was the case. After running released factories in 2D gels, we can now partially purify the 3 complexes with apparent molecular masses of &amp;gt;8 MDa. We also developed a related method that does not involve fixation - 'native' 3C (chromosome conformation capture) - that allows us to catalogue genes attached to isolated factories. Our primary aim is to use these techniques to characterize some contents of factories - the active sites of transcription; we will analyze their nascent transcripts and genes (using high-throughput sequencing). We also wish to (i) analyze how their contents change when two medically-important cytokines (TNFalpha, TGFbeta) activate responsive genes, (ii) characterize a sub-set of factories producing the micro-RNAs that act as immediate effectors, and (iii) insert different test sequences at one specific site in the genome to see how they modify local and global gene activity. We also have a more general objective: we proposed a model for the organization of human chromosomes during interphase (active transcription units cluster into factories), and we plan to see if this model is correct.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This basic research project applied to a biomedical problem should impact upon a wide group of academics. As outlined under 'Academic beneficiaries', we should provide results of benefit to (i) academics working on all signaling pathways in the short term by confirming that the canonical TNFalpha/NFkappaB and TGFbeta/SMAD pathways contain an unforeseen leg (one passing through factories dedicated to transcribing specific gene sub-sets), (ii) the medical community interested in developing anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour therapies (as these signaling pathways have direct medical relevance) in both the short and long terms, (iii) academics working on miRNAs (by confirming that miRNAs are also produced in specialized factories) in the short term, (iv) the medical community (as our 3 miRNAs play roles in cancer, arthritis, and diabetes) in the longer term, (v) academics working on systems biology in the short term, and (v) academics using 'Monte Carlo' and 'molecular dynamics' computer simulations to model chromosomes confined within a nucleus in the short and long terms.

I also anticipate we have a good chance of finding both the effector miRNAs that the cytokines utilize and their targets; this knowledge should be of interest to academics, the medical community, and pharmaceutical companies. Thus, it remains difficult to identify both effector miRNAs (against a high background) and their targets (the algorithms used yield many false positives). However, I suggest that identifying the host genes that share dedicated (responsive) factories will lead us directly to these effectors and their targets. Thus, we speculated that TNFa might down-regulate many mRNAs by activating production of miRNAs encoded by the miRNA-hosting genes that are co-transcribed in the special 'miRNA factories' that we have uncovered. Therefore, we selected the 100 mRNAs most down-regulated 1 and 4 h after adding TNFa, and then examined how many were targeted by the miRNAs produced in these factories. An incredible 88 out of the 200 down-regulated mRNAs possessed such targets (significantly more than a randomly-selected control group)! Therefore, we believe we can develop a general approach that will allow us to uncover miRNA effectors and their targets. As miRNAs are increasingly being seen as both potential new drug targets and therapeutic agents, this clearly opens up many new possibilities.

If results of commercial value are obtained, they will be marketed through Isis Innovation - the University's technology transfer company. Isis has commercialized some of our monoclonal antibodies (directed against RNA polymerase sub-units; currently being sold under licence by Santa Cruz, and this brings a small royalty stream to the Department and University). It also has obtained 3 patents on my behalf - the last being one for a closed-form (i.e., non-iterative) way of localizing the position of a fluor in a noisy image with 2-fold higher precision than is currently available (of use in 'super-resolution' microscopy). Thus, we continue to commercialize our results.

The economic impact of this research will include the further development of highly-trained research scientists who go on to play important roles in society. [Some individuals I trained include: Jeremy Levin (now chief executive of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the world's largest provider of generic drugs), Shailendra B Patel (now Chief of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Clinical Nutrition, Professor of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI), Paul Dear (now Head of the Single molecule genomics group, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge), A. Bass Hassan (now Professor of Medical Oncology and Consultant Medical Oncologist, Oxford Cancer Centre),and Ana Pombo (now Group Head of Genome Function, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Hammersmith Hospital Campus).

In conclusion, this research has ample potential to contribute to the nation's health and wealth.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>435572</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>iotaSciences Ltd</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>This company is commercializing a novel way of performing microfluidics</gtr:description><gtr:id>DD617D10-DFE4-43FB-B4FA-DAE162C04ED6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This company is commercializing a novel way of performing microfluidics</gtr:impact><gtr:url>http://iotaSciences.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2016</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0D63EF42-1739-4955-9309-8F68A87A1B7E"><gtr:id>0D63EF42-1739-4955-9309-8F68A87A1B7E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Merging drops in a Teflon tube, and transferring fluid between them, illustrated by protein crystallization and drug screening.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Lab on a chip</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5707abd434e870d594e72e8361ff9650"><gtr:id>5707abd434e870d594e72e8361ff9650</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Feuerborn A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1473-0189</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/673B8F30-7BB7-4175-9FB1-C0E25095D51B"><gtr:id>673B8F30-7BB7-4175-9FB1-C0E25095D51B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Biocompatibility of fluids for multiphase drops-in-drops microfluidics.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biomedical microdevices</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bcb9d009bac791e57d63e2273be3782b"><gtr:id>bcb9d009bac791e57d63e2273be3782b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Prastowo A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1387-2176</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4C0286AF-74F0-44A2-AC8D-8D0B296BA44E"><gtr:id>4C0286AF-74F0-44A2-AC8D-8D0B296BA44E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Why the activity of a gene depends on its neighbors.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trends in genetics : TIG</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5707abd434e870d594e72e8361ff9650"><gtr:id>5707abd434e870d594e72e8361ff9650</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Feuerborn A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0168-9525</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K010867/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
