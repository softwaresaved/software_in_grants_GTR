Concerned with how philosophy might be 'described' through film, the output of this project will constitute the third film of a series of films that address this issue.\n\nThe outputs from this project will be of interest to a wide range of scholars across the arts and humanities engaged in practice led research and interdisciplinary theoretical work, particularly in the fields of film and media studies, philosophy, cultural studies, literary studies and fine art. The outputs will facilitate new ways for disciplines to talk to each other allowing for cross fertilisation and a fresh perspective both from within and outside of the disciplines. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Public\nThe film &amp;amp; related outputs have potential to make a significant impact beyond the academy by engaging audiences with questions of philosophy. Developments in science and the arts already have well established ways of reaching a public audience. By contrast, thoughtful reflection on contemporary life and culture - philosophical reflection broadly conceived - is far less well supported. This project aims to stimulate this kind of reflection through using current media methodologies. Engagement with philosophy &amp;amp; philosophical inquiry can lead to an enhancement in the quality of life, both creatively &amp;amp; intellectually by allowing people to think through important issues in new and different ways. In addition as this is an interdisciplinary project, the audience demographics are varied as audiences engage through different subjects of interest (i.e. Film /Filmmaking/Philosophy/Derrida/Fine Art/Media) thereby facilitating access to a wide audience. This is exemplified by the symposium which will bring together leading scholars and artists in these different fields to debate issues arising from the research. \n\nMuseums, galleries &amp;amp; cultural venues \nThese will benefit by bringing in new audiences to their venues enriching the cultural landscape through introducing/re-introducing the public to philosophical ideas creatively. Philosophy is not a subject matter explicitly found in these venues though often artworks do reference philosophy. The advantage of Ontological Narratives is both the use of audio visual media as a contemporary methodology and the employment of narrative as a tool to introduce complex subject matter. The project is also explicitly concerned with philosophy and therefore can operate to some degree as an educational tool. \n\nIndustry \nIndustry will benefit through the provision of employment for professionals (technicians, artists) and the reapplication of experience working within a different sector by these individuals. An academic research context may allow an artistic freedom not usually experienced in professional commercial filmmaking. This experience may have positive benefits as these professionals find new ways to approach problems &amp;amp; opportunities born from artistic license rather than commercial imperative. This can lead to improved economic output &amp;amp; competitiveness as temporary freedom from these parameters opens up artistic possibilities, which can in turn be reapplied in a commercial environment. For example development of a commercial documentary on philosophy with Stampede a Luton based, award winning production company is currently underway. \n \nOther\nMedia students from UoB will benefit directly through participation in film production and mentoring by professionals thus increasing &amp;amp; improving their employability potential. A research informed teaching project will facilitate student involvement engaging students formally in the research process and will be funded through UoB Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Directorate. This was an effective strategy used in 'Ontological Narratives II' that resulted in increased employability, higher academic attainment and the undertaking of postgraduate study. \n\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48142</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A feature film that weaves documentary and fiction which consider some of Jacques Derrida's ideas.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CE045762-2E88-4D26-B0D1-40F21C9509C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A review in Times Higher education
