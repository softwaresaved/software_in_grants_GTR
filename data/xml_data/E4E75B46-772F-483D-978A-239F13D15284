Do people draw upon a knowledge of past environments in thinking about future environmental scenarios, including those associated with the changing climate? This project will develop innovative methodologies for engaging with the active perception of the environment in particular localities. Mike Hulme, in 'Why We Disagree About Climate Change', has argued that variations in the perception of climate change arise from different cultural outlooks on our natural and social worlds and different levels of exposure to climate risk. This points us towards the pressing need to find ways of eliciting and recording these cultural outlooks, while also leading us to ask: to what extent do people connect their local environmental knowledge with global processes?
In order to relate environmental transformations to the perceptions of processes such as climate change, it is necessary to have a detailed knowledge of how environmental experiences are shaped and narrated. We will gather and build a database of narratives and images exploring and reflecting upon environmental pasts and futures in East Anglia, a region with a long history of landscape flux and, due to its flat and low-lying nature, a particular vulnerability to processes of climate change. Recognising, in keeping with the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, that questions of intergenerational equity are central to our capacity to respond to the challenges of the changing environment, an integral part of our research will be the involvement of schools and schoolchildren. By walking pathways in the Fen landscape and by experiencing places, objects and images children will engage with different narratives and forms of expertise about the environment they are living in (from natural features to spirits and legends of the place). Working with the Greater Fens Museum Partnership, who have extensive experience of community and school outreach, we will organise a series of activity days in which schoolchildren will draw upon the narratives collected for the database, and work with artists, environmental scientists, and museum staff to generate creative responses to their regional environmental history. This will culminate in an exhibition, hosted by the Greater Fens Museum Partnership and curated by the children. These will give a valuable insight into the routes by which children are able to perceive and engage with environmental history, and how this feeds into visions of the future in the context of climate change. Outcomes from the schools projects and the exhibitions will be added to the database.
Climate change is experienced by communities in particular localities, but can only be understood as a global process. For this reason, an important part of our research will be to foster cross-cultural links between schools and grassroots organisations exploring the ways in which different localities can find common ground. Drawing on existing networks in regions where the Division of Social Anthropology has strong working relationships, especially Alaska, Mongolia, and Vietnam (but open to future collaborations elsewhere), we will explore the extent to which methods we are developing in the UK are applicable in these different research contexts and what lessons can be learned. By establishing connections between schools and organisations in the East Anglia with their counterparts elsewhere in the world, we will not only be exploring how communities perceive environmental change in their own locality, but also how they receive and respond to the experience of change elsewhere in the world. In addition to establishing virtual links, we will invite educators and community organisers from these diverse settings to participate in the workshops providing opportunities for interaction and knowledge transfer around issues of environmental change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate that outcomes of the project will be of benefit to policy makers at local and national level. As local authorities in the region have already sought to draw upon narrative memory in the formulation of policy, for example in the development of the Cambridgeshire Surface Water Management Plan, it has been indicated that our planned database of narratives of environmental change will be of particular interest for local government. On a national level, the University's Centre for Science and policy has organised meetings between researchers on the proposed project and Senior Civil Servants in the Department for Communities and Local Government, who have expressed a particular interest in the insight that anthropological research might bring to issues of planning, flood management, and regional adaptation to climate change. The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs have also expressed interest in our previous Climate Histories network and have sought a meeting to discuss our research. Through maintaining contact with these policy makers and inviting them to become involved in project events (particularly the end-of-project workshop), we hope to maximise the opportunity for the outcomes of the project to have a wider influence.

We have worked closely with scientists who are actively involved in communication with policy makers, and the need for this research emerges from these collaborations: the Climate Histories network from which the current proposal emerges involves two lead authors in the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the development of our work has also been encouraged by Charles Kennel of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Former Director of the NASA Mission to Planet Earth. Through continuing to work with our contacts through the network, and inviting our scientific colleagues to workshops over the course of the project we are not only confident that we have a route for disseminating the significance of our work for debates in the environmental sciences, but also that we are in a strong position to have the research incorporated in the process of communicating scientific findings to policy makers.

This project will be of particular benefit to schools, with school activity days and a museum exhibition to be curated by schoolchildren an integral part of our research programme. In order to ensure that schools activities reach a wider audience, we will liaise with the local authority to invite teachers from other schools in the area to participate in and observe the activity days; we will also work with a consultant with experience in classroom education to make the documentation of the activity days we are organising available on the WWW, so that the material can be used by teachers in the design of curriculum-relevant lesson plans.

We anticipate that the nature of our work, which will draw on the the rich potential of folklore and local beliefs of place to shape narratives of environmental change, will be of interest to publishers of children's literature. To this end we hope to develop existing links with the publishing industry and to invite children's publishers to our project workshops and to a viewing of the museum exhibition, in the hope that this can lead to the production of new forms of children's literature with benefits for environmental education.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>655757</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Our activities with young people encouraged them to interact with their environment and to explore that relationship: walking, talking, listening to stories and writing them, working with artists to create things in the present and working with archaeologists to think about the things that others left behind. 

They sent letters across the world to share some of their own lives with students living in very different conditions - asking about animals, and gardens, Minecraft and football, and often quite profound questions about friendship and family. And they made time capsules to send other messages forward in time. 

The artists' work is their own reflection of the creativity and enthusiasm they found whilst working with the primary school students in Wilburton and The Weatheralls School, Soham. 

Kyle Kirkpatrick's work draws on the children's curiosity about what lies beneath the ground under their feet and their reflections on how Soham has changed over time - and might change in the future. 

Rachel Wooller's work emerges from children's exploration and construction in the woods at Wilburton and thinking about how humans adapt to the shifting landscape.

Through the photographs, taken during the walks which the children led us on, we invite you to take a journey across the landscapes through the children's eyes, and to enjoy the striking contrast of these places - as well as to consider how the fens, the tundra, the steppes and even the mountains offer similar challenges to inhabitants, particularly in the face of extreme environmental processes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>76E2D8FD-C190-4BCD-A7A8-9D20CF934DF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition was feature in local press reports</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Sensing landscapes: artists and children working together</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cire.group.cam.ac.uk/PathwaysProject/sensinglandscapes</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, DEFRA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C89F49EB-222F-4B90-BEFC-75A693829D5D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Richard Irvine met with Dr Fiona Harrison, Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

We have also developed partnerships in the fenland region (through participation in our Year 1 workshop) that will seek policy briefing in the near future.

Schools in the region have drawn on our ideas in their curriculum development, and students and teachers participated in our Year 1 workshop to share ideas on environmental education in dialogue with educators from the Alaska and Mongolia.

Creative work emerging from our research includes collaborations with Wysing Arts Centre (the creation of environmental artwork in Barrington, and the involvement of a researcher from our team in the &amp;quot;History Rising&amp;quot; project exhibition), and by the development of Steve Waters' play 'In a Vulnerable Place' (funded by the Arts Council), which draws extensively on themes from our research.

On the level of international policy, a researcher from our team has met with the Head of Polar Regions Department, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, to brief them on findings from the cross-cultural elements of our project.

Our work with schools has been instrumental in shaping teaching programmes, both here in the UK and abroad in Mongolia, Alaska, Mexico and South Africa. For example, one school has regularised a programme of archaeological investigation of their school grounds to support teaching of its Stone Age topic. 

We have made teaching resources available through our website which teachers are able to access and download for free.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1C2A2D82-F077-49DE-B56A-935DF4E21BD5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Initial findings suggest that children in the East Anglia region develop distinct attitudes towards environmental change through play and narrative imagination, and that these attitudes often come into conflict with adult decision making surrounding those spaces.

This work in schools also has the potential to aid Key Stage 2 curriculum development in areas relevant to exploration of children's environments.

Where research discovers tensions between different stakeholders in the region, here again we will make representations to government and civil society organisations in order to guide planning decisions.
