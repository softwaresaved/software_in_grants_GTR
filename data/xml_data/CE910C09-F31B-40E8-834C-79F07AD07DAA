Around 41,600 people were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2011 in the UK. It is also the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK, due to the formation of distant metastases. The liver is a primary target organ of metastatic lesions. More than half patients with colorectal cancer eventually develop a Colorectal Liver Metastases (CRLM); the liver metastasis can be present at the time of diagnosis of colorectal cancer or develop after the primary tumour was operated. Surgical resection is the only treatment associated with long-term survival for patients with CRLM. Recent studies have reported 5-year survival rates of 30%-60% for patients with resected CRLMs. Preoperative chemotherapy leads to a decrease in the size of CRLM, enabling resection in up to 16% of the patients with initially unresectable lesions. Among patients with resectable CRLM, the use of preoperative chemotherapy may diminish the magnitude of resection required. Therefore, an effective therapeutic treatment is crucial to control the liver metastasis, dramatically slow down disease progression and improve healing prospects.

In cancer diagnosis and treatment procedures, qualitative histopathological evaluation on microscopic samples from tumour tissue is regarded as the gold standard for confirmative diagnosis of almost all types of cancer. For CRLM, the assessment of pathological tumour regression after preoperative chemotherapy is mostly based on estimating the proportion of tumour cells in relation to the total tumour area (including the latter tumour necrosis, fibrosis and other regressive changes) as well as biologically relevant histology features, in particular the tumour invasion front. These properties determine pathological tumour regression or grade of response to chemotherapy and provide valuable prognostic information on the risk for cancer progression. Currently, this histopathological evaluation is performed by expert pathologists through visual assessment of the tumour slides. This is often time-consuming and expensive due to the large amount of slides to be reviewed and the limited availability of subspecialised liver pathologists. Moreover, visual evaluations are inherently subject to inter- and intra-observer variability, and may be unacceptably inconsistent and imprecise, with negative impact in the actual diagnosis and future treatment planning. 

This project aims at developing an intelligent computer system that enables automatic, precise, objective and reproducible assessment of CRLM tumour regression and precise characterisation of the tumour invasion front based on the digital scans of resected CRLM tumour tissue slides, by integrating beyond the state-of-the-art, specifically designed computer vision, image processing and machine learning schemes. The outcome is useful in both clinical and research domains, by providing additional reference in the association between tumour regression and chemotherapy treatment for prognostic purposes in clinical practice, and enabling better understanding on the mechanism of tumour progression in the liver - and hence gain valuable knowledge that can be used to counteract it. In both domains, such solutions are expected to help reduce the costs and manpower consumption in the practises. The proposed methodologies and system can be generalised or extended for similar purposes in the diagnosis or treatment procedures of other types of cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are three main beneficiary groups in this project: researchers on liver cancer treatment, liver surgery teams and the general public. 
This project will directly benefit researchers in liver histopathology domains who make continuous efforts in reducing the intensive labour costs and inter-investigator variability associated with the manual annotation of microscopic images of CRLM tumours. This project provides computer based models that can facilitate automation of a major part of the process in CRLM grading and progression assessment with a good level of accuracy. The benefit of the project outcome is two-fold: the automated process will reduce the high manpower and cost associated to the traditional manual process; and the objectivity and reproducibility of the system output will help eliminating inter- and intra-observer variability and thus lead to enhanced assessment and treatment planning. This project, if successful, will bring the research on pre-operative chemotherapy for CRLM a big step forward by assisting the assessment of therapeutic efficacy. The assessment result, in addition to that of manual assessment, can be used to establish valuable pools of historical data that is useful for further research and improvement to therapy regimen.
In addition, the proposed research can be commercialised in the form of software tools and systems. These commercialised outcomes will be adopted by liver surgery teams and therefore the immediate beneficiaries of this project consist of medical organisations and healthcare services working on liver cancer. In this project, we will closely work with Dr. B&amp;eacute;la Boz&amp;oacute;ky and Dr. Carlos Fern&amp;aacute;ndez Moro of the Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge/Karolinska Institute (KUH) of Sweden, who will advise this research process as an end-user and apply the research outcomes of this project to the investigations of CRLM treatment outcome. The output of this project, will further benefit liver surgery teams at different medicanstitutions in improving their the diagnosis and treatment processes and outcomes.
In the long term, the computer models developed in this project will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of CRLM. The pathway to clinical impact would be via extensive testing of the new models. The UK has a very strong cancer research community, which makes this a promising strategy for long-term clinical impact. Therefore, this research will eventually benefit the general public by contributing to the diagnosis and treatment of CRLM, improve the prospect of CRLM patients and enhance their experience. More broadly, the success of this project can inspire the application of similar technology in the diagnosis and treatment of other types of cancer and lead to extended impact on the health of citizens.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100001</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N034708/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
