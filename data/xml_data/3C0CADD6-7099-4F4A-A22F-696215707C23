The workshop will incorporate a keynote talk from Professor Catherine Tucker (MIT Sloan School of Management) on Personalisation and Electronic Privacy in Pricing and Digital Marketing; flash presentations from experts and users in the area (provisionally confirmed speakers are Prof Cormode, Warwick Computer Science and Alan Turing Institute; Prof Mandy Chessell, IBM Distinguished Engineer and IBM Master Inventor; Howard Langer, Global MD Pricing &amp;amp; Promotions, dunnhumby); an introduction to the framework from Dr Stalla-Bourdillon (Law, University of Southampton) and facilitated discussions to develop research questions. 

Participants will come from operational research, digital marketing, behavioural science, computer science, service systems, law and statistics as well as users from organisations that use demand management.

A summary of the workshop will be written up and presented in a variety of styles to benefit other users, the general (interested) public, and other academics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The workshop will bring together both users and academics, ensuring that users benefit first hand from the talks and discussion on the day. Users will form a key part of the workshop, helping to set the agenda, provide some of the flash presentations, and to ensure that the research questions coming out of the day are relevant to them.

A key output of the workshop is to define the problems that UK Industry are facing under the new General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the EU in 2016. Users will develop a better understanding of these regulations during the one-day workshop and the implications for their current business practices. Discussions between users to share ideas and good practice would also be of benefit to participant organisations. The impact of the workshop will go beyond the attendees using mechanisms listed in the Pathway to Impact document, to increase understanding of these issues and associated open questions across UK industry. 

Research resulting from the workshop will lead to improved transparency in the management of rationed goods (i.e. goods for which demand outstrips supply) and reassurance to customers of such goods that their personal information is being used effectively (and legally) to improve services without impinging on civil liberties.

We anticipate the workshop helping to increase the technical knowledge of UK practitioners and the commercial knowledge of UK researchers, helping to increase competitive advantage in this sector of the UK economy.

Being able to work within new regulations to maintain and improve the quality of demand management techniques is necessary to maintain profitability of UK business in this area. This workshop will provide ideas for how this can be done and will form one or more consortia for follow on projects that will aim to enhance UK business.

This workshop is timely, given the new regulations, and will provide benefits to businesses using the new regulations and customers of those businesses.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15412</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P026117/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0F2F1A7-287A-4B6F-AA0E-74A55BB4DEE4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Aspects of OR</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
