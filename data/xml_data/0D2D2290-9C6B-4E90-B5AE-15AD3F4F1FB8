firmicutes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/N002903/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>All the cells of a species contain the same DNA; what distinguishes them is the way in which that DNA is activated ('transcribed'). One method of regulating DNA transcription is through direct chemical modification of the DNA itself, most commonly through a process of methylation. This is termed 'epigenetic' regulation. There has been extensive study of epigenetic regulation in humans and other complex life forms, but comparatively little in bacteria. Bacterial genomes are often extensively methylated, as a consequence of 'restriction modification' (RM) systems, which modify the cell's DNA at particular sites to allow it to be distinguished from the DNA of infecting viruses. The many sites of methylation across the genome have the potential to substantially affect the way in which genes are regulated. However, as most RM systems are stable and therefore cannot serve as a regulatory mechanism. This is not the case for two sets of genes we have recently independently characterised in the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, the pneumococcus. The pneumococcus is a commensal bacterium, typically carried by between a quarter and a third of young children asymptomatically, that is a major cause of diseases including middle ear infections, pneumonia and meningitis. The sets of genes we found are RM systems that vary over the course of hours or days through a specific set of DNA rearrangements. This results in the patterns of methylation caused by the RM systems also changing over short timescales. Experimental data found that different forms of the inverting RM system caused different patterns of methylation, each of which was associated with a distinct pattern of gene expression. This epigenetic regulation of bacterial genes was found to change the virulence of the bacterium, with some patterns of methylation making the pneumococcus more likely to cause disease. This could be an important factor in the transition from the pneumococcus being a harmless commensal, to becoming a dangerous pathogen. This project is designed to test this hypothesis through studying whether the second variable RM system in the pneumococcus affects the same processes, or has a different effect on cell physiology, and whether such systems regulate the virulence of other pathogenic bacteria. Searching of the thousands of publically available bacterial DNA sequences has allowed us to identify hundreds of species that harbour similar systems. These include bacterial species that are very common in the human gut, some that are present in probiotic drinks and others involved in the production of cheese. Perhaps most importantly, they are also present in many pathogenic bacteria. This project is designed to investigate whether these variable RM systems might also regulate virulence in three bacterial species that each represent major threats to public health. The first is Streptococcus suis, a species normally associated with pigs that is emerging as a major pathogen capable of causing serious infections, such as meningitis. The second is Listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne bacterium that causes potentially fatal infections. The third is Enterococcus faecalis, a major cause of highly antibiotic-resistant infections, particularly in a hospital setting. In the three species, the variable RM loci are present with lineages that are associated with causing high levels of disease in humans, and absent from those that are asymptomatically found in animals or humans. The overall aim of the project is to work out how these systems may play a role in regulating genes involved in the bacteria's virulence, as well as how they evolved and how diverse they are. Such information will allow us to understand why these unusual genes are distributed, and why bacteria progress from being harmlessly carried to causing disease. This would better inform our strategies as to how to prevent this transition, and thereby tame these common, but potentially dangerous, bacteria.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Two distinct phase variable type I restriction modification systems, able to change their specificity through shuffling of sequences facilitated by a recombinase, have been described by us in the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae in two independent papers (Manso et al., Nat Commun. 2014, 5:5055; Croucher et al., Nat Commun. 2014. 5:5471). One of these was found to be responsible for phase variable epigenetic modification of the microbial chromosome with impact on gene expression and virulence. Both loci are absent from the related non-pathogenic species, S. mitis. We now have mined available genome information and detected four families of recombinases associated with Type I RM loci across many species, all of which are predicted to be able to vary the patterns of methylation over short timescales. Although phase variable RM loci can be found in many phyla, they are particularly highly represented among Firmicutes. In particular we have collected detailed information on likely phase variable systems in Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus suis. In all three cases the lineage or clonal complex most frequently found to cause human invasive infection is associated with the presence of a phase variable Type I RM locus. The aim of the project is to analyse the overall evolution of these systems, and then isolate clones expressing different allelic variants in the four species of interest on which to perform quantification of phase variation, methylome analysis, gene expression profiling associated to metabolome assays and virulence tests in experimental infection models. These tests are designed understand the biological mechanism underpinning the epigenetic regulation of important phenotypes. Demonstration of phase variable epigenetic control in these four species is predicted to allow us to propose phase variable epigenetic control by type I RM systems as global and novel paradigm of bacterial evolution, physiology and virulence.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project is designed to test if the novel epigenetic control mechanism discovered in Streptococcus pneumoniae is an unicum of this species, as published independently by us in two high impact papers (Manso et al., Nat Commun. 2014, 5:5055; Croucher et al., Nat Commun. 2014. 5:5471), or if holds true to be a paradigm of epigenetic control for a wide number of bacteria. We have clear preliminary data that show that these phase variable type RM systems are broadly distributed, and likely to be active, in many bacterial phyla. 

One of the main beneficiaries is the wider public, since the project aims to unravel basic mechanisms involved in bacterial population dynamics and more importantly showing that phase variable epigenetic control is widespread also in bacteria. In the specific case we address four bacterial species of substantial interest to the BBSRC, industry and health care professionals. 

Interest in food safety is a primary goal for all players in the long chain and the species Listeria monocytogenes has been selected as an important food borne pathogen. Data on phase variable RM systems in Listeria are hoped to yield novel epidemiological markers, markers associated to disease severity but also shed light on the virulence of this species. The concept linking presence of phase variable RM systems to highly pathogenic lineages will be tested in also S. suis, a zoonotic pathogen and first cause of human meningitis in South-east Asia. In this species the clear association of the phase variable type I RM system to serotype 2 strains, could well turn out to be one of the important virulence determinant. 

The UK has recently launched the 5 Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2013 to 2018. One of the important aspects in this strategy is to limit drug resistance to develop, but more importantly to spread. Of particular concern is the fact that many more antibiotics are used for industrial animal husbandry than directly for humans, which in turn has driven an alarming rise in antimicrobial drug resistance in bacteria carried by animals. Hence the final model species included in this project is Enterococcus faecalis, among the main candidates responsible for transfer of antimicrobial drug resistance from animals to humans. 

The widespread nature of these gene modules will allow transferring information more widely, as these gene clusters are found, in the two main phyla found within the human intestinal tract, in many probiotic and dairy species. Given the clear preliminary experimental data and the broad range of bacteria being investigated, this scientifically novel project is highly relevant to the study of bacteria globally. The industrial or health related impact may not be immediate, but given the above considerations we envisage potentially positive measurable effects in terms of public health and the field of food safety and production within few years after the project's completion.

The interdisciplinary and multi-centre nature of this project means it will be effective in training researchers in a wide range of skills. They will learn the latest molecular microbiology techniques, how to analyse high-throughput sequencing data, mine available genome sequences, and exploit newly-available sequencing technologies. Collaborations with the broader community of researchers, as outlined in our proposal, will provide for interactions with clinicians and public health experts. Other potential beneficiaries include the wider audience of students, academics and public addressed by our planned outreach activities. 

Discovering novel regulatory mechanisms, which may have the potential to be valid for many species holds promise to identify potential drug targets and inhibitors. This will not be addressed in depth within the project, but throughout the research we expect to get critical scientific information that may need protection and consideration for commercialisation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>700532</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Zurich (Universit?t Z?rich UZH)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:description>Large scale genomic screening of Listeria monocytogenes strains for phase variable genes</gtr:description><gtr:id>84B03B36-59CC-4411-91F1-A7C7918A0001</gtr:id><gtr:impact>this is an essential input into the project and which will significantly increase the impact of the scientific early publications in the grant</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners have performed PCR on 250 bacterial isolates for three distinct restriction modification systems, performed genome sequences of four isolates and provided methylome data for other 10 isolates.

The present project was designed to detect phenotypes associate to specific methylation states in three bacterial species, in order to maximize the likelihood to detect a phenotype, in order to be then able to define the molecular mode of action linking chromosomal DNA methylation to the observed phenotype.
We have started to work on the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes and first identified that the phase variable system is present in some phylogenic related groups of strains (clonal complexes, cc). We started to work on cc4 strains which show four alternative methylation stages (A-D) for which we have identified the targets by methylome analysis. For one of the variants, we have identified a phase variable phenotype which consists of increase in B-variants in late exponential growth phase and stationary phase. 
We have also been working on Streptococcus pneumoniae, where we aimed to characterize the variation of a novel type of phase variable system. We have isolated a number of mutants that demonstrate the range of 'shuffling' that can take place, and identified the novel mechanism by which these rearrangements occur. These mutants will permit us to identify the specificity of the systems, and look for differences in phenotype between different epigenetic states. We have also begun bioinformatically searching for further examples of recombinase-driven phase variable restriction modification systems. This has enabled us to identify multiple independent examples of such systems emerging and spreading between different bacterial species. This will allow our findings to be applied to multiple different bacteria of importance to biotechnology, agriculture, and human and animal health.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>On the specific topic of these phase variable methylation systems we have set up so far two industrial contacts. An MTA has been finalised with a SME (Micreos BV, Den Haag, The Netherlands), producing and marketing a bacteriophage for use in food processing and handling to prevent Listeria growth and human infection. Impact of our work could be in the selection of bacteriophages which are resistance to phase variable restriction systems. A further collaboration was set up with the international company Chr Hansen (Horsholm, Denmark) producing food starters and functional food. This contract led to the funding of a KTN CASE BBSRC studentship BB/P504737/1 entitled &amp;quot;Epigenetic control of strain fitness of starter cultures and probiotics&amp;quot;. This studentship stated in 2016 and will explore the same type of phase variable methylation system in bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus. Potential outcomes of industrial interest are related to fitness of starter cultures and methods to monitor that fitness.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7ED9D923-8A2C-4CB1-8EDB-85A2B2134F2F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>In any given wild type population of Listeria monocytogenes CC4, CC5, CC8, and CC54 a Type I Restriction Methylation System can be found to exist in four different allelic forms. This work describes a protocol for allele quantification for these allelic forms in CC4 strains. the protocol is composed of three main steps: an initial common PCR, a differentiating restriction digestion, and then a quantitative GeneScan analysis. The PCR uses primers, one of which is fluorescently labelled, which are sited in flanking regions that are common for the four allelic variants; this is followed by a digestion with EcoRV giving rise to four different-sized labelled fragments. The digested samples are then analysed on a GeneScan platform giving a spectrum of peaks whose areas can be compared, thereby allowing the relative quantification of the for hsdS alleles. Using this protocol we are able to determine the hsdS allele composition of any CC4 L. monocytogenes strain in less than 3 days.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E5E095E0-2E34-4CCC-8C5E-A32A6A693FD1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>the toll allows monitoring of sample composition and provides an important tool for validation of htgs attempts to quantify allele prevalence in a given sample.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Quantifying Listeria monocytogenes phase variable hsdS alleles</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N002903/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6EF57B2-8ACD-48E6-9B45-98507446B053</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigenetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FEBB49F4-3228-4CBC-98AB-99A078FB98B5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Functional genomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BDC9422-9331-418B-8192-152BC0EB055E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
