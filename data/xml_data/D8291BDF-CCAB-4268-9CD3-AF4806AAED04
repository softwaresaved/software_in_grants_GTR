These resources may be used 'off the shelf' as a complete course in QM (and accessible as such by any UK HEI undergraduate), or individual components can be integrated into existing courses by QM teaching staff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The course content will be adapted to undergraduate level by producing additional modules on sources of data, on data visualisation, and on secondary data analysis, and by adapting the course materials to a wider range of student abilities. The course will also be adapted so that it may be used with a range of statistical software.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The use of the learning materials will be monitored, revised and reviewed in the light of teachers' and students' feedback. The maintenance of the learning resources server and links will be continued for three years. At the end of this period the materials will be collated and archived so that they continue to be available for use.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The web based learning, teaching and assessment materials will help UK social science departments to either start or expand their QM teaching activity at undergraduate level. 
They will make it easier for departments to increase the contact hours associated with QM training, give undergraduates more space in which to practice and develop their QM skills, and to concentrate their support efforts upon the students who most need it. 
They will help disseminate best practice in undergraduate QM teaching across UK universities and encourage the shift of methodology towards a more central place in the undergraduate curriculum. 
They will encourage more students to consider secondary data analysis in their project work and give the the skills necessary to do such analysis. 
They will increase the supply of QM proficient social science graduates able to properly consider and use QM approaches in PG study or in employment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77053</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation (AT and AH 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5799F7A6-E942-4078-9862-1DE90D28BCE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Andrew Thompson and Ailsa Henderson Blending Quantitative Skills with Substance: Teaching Developments at Edinburgh; European Political Science Association, Edinburgh, June Talk to conference of 500+ political scientists (50 attended talk) about our blended learning online materials.

I have broken the uses into groups by type.

Used as core teaching material:

School of Social and Political Science: Core Quantitative Data Analysis, 200+ PG students each time, 2013, 2014

School of Social and Political Science. Summer Conversion course for students transferring into 4 degrees (Politics with Quantitative Methods, IR with Quantitative Methods, Social Policy with Quantitative Methods, Sociology with Quantitative Methods), 25 students, 2014

Used as a supplementary sources of additional activities:

Academy of Government: Analysis for Public Policy, 30 Masters in Public Policy (MPP) students each time, 2013, 2014. Approximately half of the MPP students are civil servants.

School of Social and Political Science: Introduction to Political Data Analysis, 160 UG students in 2nd year, 2015

In addition, we have established a website to advertise and distribute the material. The website contains summary information about the project and has had, since early 2014, a sample of the first two modules for those interested in the course. The website now contains these same resources along with two additional resources: documentation to provide those using the course with essential information about hosting the product, downloading it, managing access for students etc; and 3 versions of the course, one for SPSS, one for Stata and one for R. To maximize impact we have advertised this site widely, both to our Edinburgh-based networks such as AQMeN (Applied Quantitative Methods Network) and various UK-wide distribution lists, including through the Political Studies Association's new sub-group on quantitative methods teaching. Team members have also delivered several presentations on the material (to AQMeN, PSA and the European Political Science Association)

It can also be used as a basis for additional online or blended learning training. It can be incorporated in existing courses to provide practical activities or self-tests within a larger stats course, or it can be used as the first step in the development of more intermediate or advanced courses in particular statistical techniques. It has been tested at Edinburgh in various guises, for example as the core teaching material for a stand alone course (Core Quantitative Data Analysis - School of Social and Political Science) as a supplement to core material (Analysis for Public Policy- Academy of Government) and for tutorial activities (Introduction to Political Data Analysis). It is designed to be used primarily in introductory UG and PG courses and we have established a website for dissemination.

Core Quantitative Data Analysis, 2013, 2014, 
Analysis for Public Policy, 2013, 2014 
Summer School Conversion Course for 20 students pursuing new quantitative methods degrees in the School of Social and Political Science
Introduction to Political Data Analysis, 2015
Statistical Literacy, 2014


These opportunities provided us with a varied student population. CQDA is targeted at PG research students (EG MScR and PhD), Analysis for Public Policy is an executive education programme. It is composed primarily of civil servants. The Conversion Course was for students who needed to achieve an intermediate level of knowledge in QM so that they could pursue more advanced quants courses in their degrees. IPDA was an introductory course for 2nd year political science students. Statistical Literacy uses the data visualisation component. It is a course targeted at first years. 

Each of these will employ the materials again in academic year 2015-2016. Due to our expanded complement of quantitative courses as a result of our successful QStep bid, we have also arranged for the materials to be used in some of the new QStep courses related to the 'with quantitative methods' degrees and the 'regular' degrees:

Mathematics for Social Science (All QStep 'with quantitative methods' degrees, 1st year). Primarily first module on maths refresher
Introduction to Statistics for Social Science (all QStep 'with quantitative methods' degrees, 1st year)

Designing and doing social research (3rd year UG course required for all Social Policy and Sociology joint and single honours students)

In addition, Introduction to Politics &amp;amp; International Relations, the 1st year required course for all single and joint honours Politics and IR students (n=200), will include a data visualisation section, which will draw on the material in the online data visualisation module</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.q-step.ed.ac.uk/home</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This is the main output of our grant, online learning materials for undergraduate social scientists.
