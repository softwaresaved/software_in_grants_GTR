The proposed Pathfinder project will undertake a market research exercise comprised of four work stages: 

Stage 1 - Telephone Interviews: 
The interviews will be conducted either by telephone or through a site visit and each will last ~30 minutes. The interviews will be structured around a questionnaire with core questions (see below) but will be conducted in the form of a discussion in order to develop insights into the business issues of the user. The interviews will also be used to identify potential commercial collaborators and end-users. The aim will be to carry out interviews with 10-12 companies which are representative of the UK (re)insurance market.

Stage 2 - Desk Research: 
The desk research will collate information and data on the UK insurance / reinsurance market, information on the current data employed for benchmarking UK wind hazard, and information on competitor products and companies.

Stage 3 - Analysis:
Output from the desk research and interviews will be used to construct realistic information on the product's likely pricing and scale of sales, and on the level of marketing and resources necessary to gain market traction. Appropriate routes to market will be developed. A revenue model for the application will be constructed which will estimate potential revenues in the 3-5 year timeframe. Opportunities for additional spin-out products will be considered.

Stage 4 - Report and Recommendations: 
Output from stages 1-3 will be presented in a document. This report will include recommendations for the commercial potential and route to market for the technology.


HOW THE PATHFINDER WORK WILL INFORM UNDERSTANDING:

The knowledge and insights gained from the Pathfinder work will inform understanding on:

1. The size and scale of the current commercial need within the insurance sector for an improved UK extreme gust climatology and linked damage tool. 
2. The nature and level of further technical developments that would be desirable to maximize the commercial opportunity. 
3. The market opportunities to prioritise and why. 
4. The strengths and weaknesses of the project's intellectual property position.
5. The resources required to gain market traction. 
6. The stakeholders with whom a meaningful dialogue could be established prior to submission of the Follow-on-Fund proposal. 
7. The appropriate pathway to impact.
8. The likelihood of securing Follow-on funding and whether a submission in spring 2015 is appropriate.


HOW THE PATHFINDER WORK WILL BE USED TO SHAPE A ROBUST CASE FOR FOLLOW-ON FUNDING: 

The work undertaken by the Pathfinder project will influence the nature and content of the work programme for the proposed Follow-on project by:

1. Providing a sound understanding of the needs and requirements of end-users. This information will guide the focus and direction of the technical development plan and ensure that it is informed by the findings of the market assessment.
2. Clarifying the nature of the competition. This knowledge combined with the needs of stakeholders will determine which market opportunities to prioritise.
3. Clarifying the nature of the further technical developments necessary to maximise the commercial opportunity. This information will strengthen the content of the technical development plan and improve the likelihood of commercialisation success.
4. Determining the likely challenges and resources necessary to obtain commercial customers and what is the most appropriate route to market. This information will underpin the development of a credible plan to drive the project towards an appropriate commercial outcome.
5. Establishing those end-users to target as most likely to adopt the technology and who would be most appropriate to approach for letters of support.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A Follow-on project would increase the likelihood of commercial engagement and uptake of the technology in four main ways: 

(1) As a proven tool it will provide the necessary rigour and structure to develop the research in a way that will increase the chance of its successful commercial adoption; 

(2) It will provide funding to enable the completion of further technical work that the market survey will likely suggest is beneficial to maximizing the commercial potential of the technology; 

(3) It will help to develop strong and enduring relationships with commercial end-users that will benefit the work in general and maximise the opportunities for commercial adoption; 

(4) It will provide a vehicle to assist fee revenues to be reinvested into additional research thereby giving a means to further benefit and sustain the commercial development and growth value of the technology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10064</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Finance and Business Affairs All Staff Meeting at University College London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8DDD6302-9EFD-41C4-9B78-C53D7973EEA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave 30 minute presentation to the Finance and Business Affairs All Staff Meeting at UCL on &amp;quot;UK windstorm gust mapping at high resolution&amp;quot;.

Four products are envisaged: (1) Historic events, (2) Gust windspeeds by return period on a high resolution (100m) grid, (3) a time series of overall UK storminess, and (4) a windstorm risk map or index. There is also the potential for additional products to be derived relating to clustering and near term views of UK wind risk.

Twelve market participants were interviewed including reinsurance brokers, reinsurers, insurers, Lloyd's and an ILS entity.

The conclusion of the market research is that there is indeed an interest from the (re)insurance market in the proposed products. There is most interest from UK primary insurers, but also interest from Lloyd's, reinsurers and reinsurance brokers. The energy market was not considered here, but could also be interested.

The highest revenue-generating product is likely to be the UK windstorm risk map.

The main competition is likely to be the UK Meteorological Office (UKMO) as they have recently released a set of competing products.

The main strengths and differentiators of the underlying data (and thus the derived products) are (1) the length of the data record, (2) the fact that the products are predominantly observation (rather than model) based, and (3) the high, topography resolving, granularity of the products.

The main concerns expressed by interviewees are around understanding the quality of the older data, the impact of a lower quantity of stations in the early years, and on whether an extended data record really changes the product metrics to any great degree.

The main risks are (1) a relatively low barrier to entry, (2) the potential that the wind risk map may be less predictive than competitors' products, (3) the risk of being a less well known brand than the main competitor (UKMO) resulting in less effective marketing and takeup. Risk (1) can be mitigated through moderate prices. Risk (2) can be mitigated by partnering with an insurer to develop the risk map.

The suggested route to market is through an existing vendor such as JBA or Ambiental. This mitigates risk (3) above.

Estimates of gross turnover summed over a three year period are between &amp;pound;0.3m and &amp;pound;0.7m, subject to the risks above being completely mitigated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the market survey shaped and defined an application for a NERC Follow-on Fund application (October 2015).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0F4AEDAD-CED7-4E16-8699-50DAB07DD812</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Provides UK windstorm peak gust footprints at 100m resolution for the whole UK (including Northern Ireland).

1. UK hourly weather data (http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ukmo-midas/WH_Table.html) for the two parameters: hourly 10-min wind speed and 
 hourly 10-min wind direction. 1950-2013.
 
2. UK Mean Wind Data (http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ukmo-midas/WM_Table.html) for the parameter: hourly maximum 3-sec gust speed. 
 1950 - 2013.

The cleaning has involved correcting mistyped data entries and removing erroneous and duplicate data records. Nearly 4000 wind and gust records in the NERC BADC MIDAS data have been corrected. Three corrections have been made to homogenise the MIDAS UK station gust records. These corrections are: (1) The location of 282 MIDAS stations have been determined to 10m precision; (2) Gust data imputation has been performed to give complete 45-year hourly and daily maximum gust coverage at 282 stations; (3) The effective heights of the MIDAS 3-sec gust recordings have been standardised to 10m where possible.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B2A790FD-2D06-4A24-9CCA-545142569693</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These cleaned and homogenised data have contributed to the development of UK windstorm products which are being offered for licencing to the UK insurance industry.
