A transformation is taking place in the UK (echoed elsewhere) in which many more disabled people are now living independently, as part of a broader move towards social care provision that is personalised and within the individual's control. Meanwhile, there have been significant cuts to local authority budgets, with day centres, adult education provision and other services closing or limiting availability. While the move from institutional funding to personal budgets in adult social services is offering disabled people the chance to gain more independence, arrange support, and take control over their life, this is a real challenge for people with learning disabilities. Members of this group are less likely to report that this has been a positive change for them; they experience more uncertainty over the changing sector in which day services are not being adequately replaced by alternatives. In this new landscape, there is some local evidence of people with learning disabilities (and their families and allies) creating new initiatives: innovative forms of peer-led support, including 'friendship circles', to provide support, learn and share knowledge, make and meet friends as well as collective pooling of personal budgets to do something bigger, such as hiring out a former day centre for activities. However, wider evidence of these groups and the broader impacts of the changing landscape on people with learning disabilities is lacking.

The proposed research seeks to address this gap in knowledge by examining how people with learning disabilities are responding in proactive ways to day service changes. It will explore how they are managing to participate in community settings and creating new forms of collective peer-led support. It will examine the informal, lifelong and community learning involved in the development of these, what we call, 'self-build networks'. 

The researchers will undertake, for the first time, a series of detailed area-based case-studies of learning disability support landscapes across England and Scotland including interviews and observation. This will involve looking in-depth at local peer-led networks to identify how they are organised, supported and funded, their activities and connections, and their opportunities and challenges for expansion. The project will also establish an online resource to document the findings from these studies including images and short films to provide information and inspiration for other self-build networks. The project outcomes will enhance the fledgling network of self-build networks across the UK through a series of activities which will inform the future development of this emergent and important form of social care and informal learning. The activities will also facilitate connections and peer learning amongst often very locally-based networks, and through active engagement with local and national stakeholders, including local authorities, voluntary organisations, self-advocacy groups, colleges and private sector care providers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

This research will firstly benefit those people involved in it. It will engage with people with learning disabilities, and their families and supporters (e.g. friendship circles, advocacy groups) in two areas in England and two in Scotland. It will also involve the local and national voluntary and self-advocacy organisations; local and national governments; and private sector social care providers who contribute to the study. 

Others who are likely to benefit include other fledgling self-build networks, other providers of social care, and other self-advocates and stakeholders concerned with the implications of the changing social care landscape including commissioners and policy makers. We can be confident of the benefits to people involved in managing the changes in social care as the project has been developed in consultation with them (e.g. TLAP - Think Local, Act Personal). Their support indicates the significant benefit the research can offer to these, and other, organisations, in the development and management of effective post-welfare provision of social care and support for people with learning disabilities and their families.

The academic beneficiaries are discussed elsewhere, but understanding of the issues addressed in the study together with the changing concepts of social care and community learning is of critical interest to academics in the geography, education, disability studies and social policy disciplines.

How will they benefit?

The research is addressing an emerging and little known phenomenon, about which there is no substantive or accessible research. The project will fill this gap, and provide a usable and developmental set of outputs for the above stakeholders and social science researchers. Three local Advisory Groups (one combined group in England and two in Scotland) will help to tie the study to local areas in which developments are most feasible and from which others can learn. 

People with learning disabilities, and their families and carers/supporters will benefit from having examples of networks and their associated learning opportunities illustrated for them in the project findings. This will be true also of local and national voluntary organisations. These stakeholders will have opportunities to engage in workshops during the study, thus connecting with the ideas and data in an evolving way as they emerge. They will be enabled to meet with other networks, and with voluntary organisations, government and academic researchers, to share knowledge and develop provision. 

The various stakeholder beneficiaries will have access to resource packs ('how to' guides) and an online resource in which they will be able to see multimedia accounts of how people with learning disabilities are reclaiming social care through various self-built networks. The online resource will provide them with accounts of how people with learning disabilities and their families and supporters are finding and negotiating support outside of day services and their involvement in small-scale, peer-led networks. Local and national voluntary organisations will benefit from debates about the findings in the workshops, professional press and on Twitter. Local government provision of social care and support for people with learning disabilities and their families is under significant pressure. Self-build networks offer the potential for the development of alternative and innovative services. As such, local authorities, will benefit hugely from increased knowledge generated by the research project (through the resource packs and online resource) about the activities of these organisations, and how they can best be supported. Local authorities will be able to access the briefing papers, resource packs, online resource, and a small number will be invited to attend local and national feedback workshops where they can interact with these organisations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296996</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P011764/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A05AA82B-96A8-4834-97FE-23963DE22DB5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Phases of education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
