Nerve cells depend on these chemical signals in order to carry out the functions of the brain, and any errors in neurotransmitter signalling can give rise to brain diseases, such as Parkinson's disease or drug addiction. One important neurochemical in the brain is the amino acid, glutamate. Glutamate is released from many nerve cells, and stimulates target cells by binding to receptor proteins specialised to recognise glutamate. Among the family of glutamate receptor proteins, one in particular is very interesting because it can have both beneficial effects and harmful effects on the brain. This receptor protein, known as the 'NMDA receptor', is required for the normal development of the brain from childhood to adulthood, and is also activated while the brain is learning and acquiring new information and memories. However, this receptor can be active under conditions that cause cells to die- this is known as neurodegeneration. Scientists have been interested in NMDA receptors for many years, and NMDA receptors have been identified and carefully characterised in several brain regions. However, one brain region where little is known about NMDA receptors is a set of nerve cells that are thought to be important in controlling our movements, and in making us feel rewarded and motivated. These nerve cells release another important brain chemical known as dopamine. They are believed to be affected in several brain diseases, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and drug addiction. NMDA receptors are believed to have an important role in controlling the behaviour of dopamine nerve cells, but at present, we do not know which kinds of NMDA receptors are found here, or what beneficial or harmful effects NMDA receptors have on these cells. This project aims to characterise NMDA receptors in dopamine nerve cells, and to link the activity of NMDA receptors to a simple behavioural learning process. Not only will the results from this project provide new information about how NMDA receptors are involved in the normal function of dopamine nerve cells, but it might reveal new NMDA receptor targets for developing therapies in some of the brain diseases mentioned.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal aims to identify NMDA glutamate receptor (NMDAR) NR2 subunit composition at subcellular locations in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. DA nuclei are pivotal in reward-directed learning and behaviours. Synaptic NMDARs determine the firing patterns and synaptic plasticity of DA neurons. In addition to these physiological functions, NMDARs (possibly extrasynaptic) can induce excitotoxity, one proposed mechanism of DA cell death in Parkinson's disease. The functions of NMDARs are dependent on their NR2 subunit composition, which influences the time-course of NMDAR-mediated responses, the polarity of synaptic plasticity, and the trafficking of glutamate receptors at synapses: these would all be expected to influence learning and behaviour. We hypothesise that synaptic NMDARs in midbrain DA neurons undergo a switch in their subunit composition during postnatal development, comparable to other brain regions, with NR2B-containing NMDARs being replaced or accompanied by NR2A subunits by postnatal days 14-21. By contrast, we propose that extrasynaptic NMDARs are composed of NR2B and NR2D subunits, possibly in unusual triheteromeric assemblies. We will also investigate whether NR2D subunits occur at synapses. We hypothesise that synaptic NR2 subunit expression is altered during behavioural adaptation in response to a salient stimulus (psychostimulant drug). NMDARs composed of different NR2 subunits can be distinguished using antibodies, by their kinetic and pharmacological profiles, and by their single channel behaviour. We will test our hypotheses using a combination of neurophysiological recordings, pharmacological tools, immunolabelling and imaging, and a behavioural adaptation assay. These studies will provide new information about NMDAR subunit composition in midbrain DA neurons. The identified subunits might provide novel therapeutic targets in drug addiction and Parkinson's disease and aid understanding of the neural networks involved in these disorders.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>198205</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration on NMDA receptor Pharmacology</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E7D7EF2-AC86-41AC-8549-9FB05C4D6CB2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Su&amp;aacute;rez,F., Zhao, Q., Monaghan, D.T., Jane, D.E., Jones, S. and Gibb A.J.

tested, making NMDA receptors in midbrain dopamine neurones distinctive from cortical, hippocampal and cerebellar
brain neurones (Brothwell et al., 2008 J Physiol 586:739-750). This raises questions about the mechanisms by
which SN neurones perform functions predominantly attributed to NR2A subunits (eg LTP; prosurvival signalling).
Aim-2: We have found that both NR2B and NR2D subunits contribute to functional synaptic NMDA receptors in midbrain
dopamine neurones throughout postnatal development, most likely in an unusual triheteromeric combination
(Brothwell et al., 2008). This offers the unique opportunity of studying native synaptic NR2D-containing
NMDARs and synaptic triheteromeric NMDARs receptors in the mammalian brain. These particular receptors are
identified by a combination of pharmacological (supported by our collaboration with Professor D Jane, Bristol) and
kinetic measurements (Brothwell et al., 2008) and endow domaminergic neurones with a slow time course, low
magnesium sensitivity (Huang &amp;amp; Gibb, 2014) synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors that may contribute to the characteristic burst firing behaviour of these neurones that is crucial for their function in vivo.
We have also optimised the conditions for immunolabelling in midbrain slices containing SN neurones with
commercial and custom NR2B antibodies (from our collaborator, Professor FA Stephenson), tyrosine hydroxylase
antibody (marker of dopaminergic neurones), and VGLUT antibody (marker of glutamatergic synaptic terminals) (Fig
2). Due to the difficulties of using the NR2 antibodies in brain slices, considerable time and effort was directed at
achieving what we feel is an acceptable standard of labelling, but we are now poised to complete the immunolabelling
alongside physiology and pharmacology to investigate these unusual NMDARs.
Aim-3: Using a combination of pharmacological single channel and kinetic measurements we have found that NR2B and NR2D subunits (but not NR2A subunits) also form extrasynaptic NMDA receptors throughout postnatal
development, most likely as triheteromeric receptors (Suarez et al., 2011). This is particularly interesting as in cortex and hippocampus there is evidence that maturation includes selective stabilisation of NR2Acontaining receptors at synaptic sites. Furthermore, we have discovered that NMDARs in SNc dopaminergic neurones show different properties of desensitization and sensitivity to regulation by intracellular ATP compared to SNr nondopaminergic neurones (Suarez et al., 2011), that may be of importance to the sensitivity of these neurones to excitotoxicity and oxidative stress and which we hypothesise will have implications for the trafficking and plasticity of NMDARs in the two SN neuronal populations.
Aim-4: In the past 6 months we have optimised our detection of a progressive increase in locomotor activity in response to a
daily injection of amphetamine (2.5mg/kg) compared with saline injection in early postnatal rats (P7, P14; Fig 4A,B).
This represents the development of behavioural sensitization. We have also demonstrated that rats of this age, like
those aged P17, show an increase in the amplitude ratio of AMPA-EPSCs to NMDA-EPSCs measured 24 or 96
hours following a single injection of amphetamine, compared with saline. However, we have not observed a change in the sensitivity of NMDA-EPSCs to ifenprodil following a single exposure to amphetamine, either 24 or 96 hours after a single injection at P7 or P14, or 7 days after a single injection at P7. These data suggest that any changes in NMDARs at these synapses do not involve an overt change in NR2 subunit composition.
Aim-5: Following our optimisation of NR2B immunolabelling and imaging in midbrain slices, we can now visualise obvious differences in the pattern of distribution of NR2B subunits in SNc dopaminergic, VTA dopaminergic, and SN non-dopaminergic neurones.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Understanding the mechanisms of plasticity at excitatory synapses on domapinergic neurones is an area that has subsequently recieved much attention and particularly, questions of whether glycine or D-serine is the main co-agonist for the NMDA receptor on dopaminergic neurones has been very topical in the neuroscience community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>692A8C58-00E1-4DD7-887F-65A170F9F384</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B17A4A80-B215-4FA8-AE93-0BC997FBC025"><gtr:id>B17A4A80-B215-4FA8-AE93-0BC997FBC025</gtr:id><gtr:title>NR2B- and NR2D-containing synaptic NMDA receptors in developing rat substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurones.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6b4e2542fbf876114051f1d7d785b47f"><gtr:id>6b4e2542fbf876114051f1d7d785b47f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brothwell SL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-3751</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/106F76EC-63DF-4A10-A50C-954203C4D849"><gtr:id>106F76EC-63DF-4A10-A50C-954203C4D849</gtr:id><gtr:title>A tingle of extra excitement with voltage dependence of NMDA receptor activation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b470d70ca139d9981192c99e1ce5245f"><gtr:id>b470d70ca139d9981192c99e1ce5245f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gibb AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-3751</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D55EDC2B-628A-4EBA-A800-508962E5828C"><gtr:id>D55EDC2B-628A-4EBA-A800-508962E5828C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Functional heterogeneity of NMDA receptors in rat substantia nigra pars compacta and reticulata neurones.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The European journal of neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/18a93a1e19bdcc28e89332ceabdd4f2a"><gtr:id>18a93a1e19bdcc28e89332ceabdd4f2a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Su?rez F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0953-816X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2052FE8E-D95F-4312-96FE-ED391670D3CD"><gtr:id>2052FE8E-D95F-4312-96FE-ED391670D3CD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dopamine D1 receptor inhibition of NMDA receptor currents mediated by tyrosine kinase-dependent receptor trafficking in neonatal rat striatum.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f61632074de67b069582d0c7a501a3d4"><gtr:id>f61632074de67b069582d0c7a501a3d4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tong H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-3751</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D015782/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
