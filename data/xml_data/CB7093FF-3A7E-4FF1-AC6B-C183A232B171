The project explored the changing relations between the judiciary, executive and Parliament in light of recent constitutional reforms which established the judiciary as a more separate branch of government. Throughout the project the research team held private seminars with representatives from all three branches of government and the legal profession, to stimulate dialogue between them. They now want to take their findings out to a wider audience, by organising a series of lectures, seminars and conferences to disseminate their findings to different practitioner communities through 2014. 
To help engage with new audiences, many of these follow-up activities involve working with partner organisations. 

Promoting dialogue with non-lawyers
- To take the discussion out to wider groups in politics and civil society, three seminars will be organised with different think tanks: the Centre for Policy Studies (Conservative leaning), CentreForum (Lib Dem) and the Fabian Society (Labour). 

Promoting dialogue with the three branches of government
- For judges and lawyers, events will be held in the Supreme Court, Middle Temple, Judicial College and the Administrative Law Bar Association. For Parliamentarians, events will be organised with the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Constitution, and the Parliament and Constitution Centre in the Commons Library. For Whitehall, there will be seminars in the Ministry of Justice, Judicial Appointments Commission and Institute for Government. 

Closing Conference
- These follow up events will conclude with a big public conference in autumn 2014 to round off the programme. It will involve the key participants of the last 10 years (Lord Woolf, Lord Judge, Jack Straw), and address the key questions raised during the public discussions: have the judiciary become too powerful? Are the judges sufficiently accountable? etc.

Dissemination in the media 
- The research team will promote all these events, and wider discussions through their web pages, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.

Archival Interviews with former Lord Chancellors and Lord Chief Justices
- The researchers have talked to most of the five former Lord Chancellors and three Lord Chief Justices. They now plan to record proper TV quality interviews with each of them to create a historical archive. These would form an important historical record. The Lord Chancellors and Lord Chief Justices have been the leading actors in the recent constitutional changes, but for judicial reasons they have been reticent about their role.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries, and Pathways to Impact
The main beneficiaries of these dissemination activities are shown below. The right hand column records the seminars and activities specifically aimed at each of these groups

Target audiences: Targeted outlets for each group
- Senior judges, and future leaders of the judiciary: Seminars in Supreme Court, Judicial College, Middle Temple

- MPs and peers, Parliamentary officials, MPs' researchers: Events with APPG on Constitution; Parliament and Constitution Centre in HC Library; Commons Justice Committee, Lords Constitution Committee

- Think tanks, parliamentary and political staff across the political spectrum: Events with Centre for Policy Studies (Con), CentreForum (LD), Fabian Society (Lab)

- Senior civil servants: Seminars at Ministry of Justice, Institute for Government, Judicial Appointments Commission

- Solicitors, barristers, law students: Lectures to Middle Temple, Admin Law Bar Assn, UK Constitutional Law Blog

- All the audiences above:Closing conference in autumn 2014

In practice the audiences will not all be so neatly segmented; nor would we want them to be, since we want to promote dialogue between them. The main purpose of the closing conference will be to bring all the different audiences together to discuss the issues they have been debating in their specialist forums.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28078</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>These are seven long video interviews with the leading figures involved in the most profound constitutional changes affecting the judiciary in the UK for many years, deposited with the Legal Biography archive at LSE. The interviews were conducted in the autumn of 2014 by the legal journalist Joshua Rozenberg. Taking part were: 

 The last of the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; Lord Chancellors, Lord Mackay of Clashfern.

 The transitional figure of Lord Falconer, who negotiated the changes of behalf of Tony Blair's government.

 His successors as &amp;quot;new style&amp;quot; Lord Chancellors combined with the post of Justice Secretary, the senior cabinet ministers and MPs Jack Straw for Labour and the Conservative Ken Clarke.

 On behalf of the judiciary, the successive Lord Chief Justices of England and Wales who were the first to become heads of the judiciary:

 Lord Woolf, Lord Phillips who went on to become the first President of the Supreme Court, and Lord Judge.

The constitutional reforms did not happen smoothly. They began with the abrupt dismissal of the Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine in 2003 and finally emerged after detailed and often tense negotiations between the judges and Tony Blair's government, ending up in compromises between the two sides that were still being worked through more than a decade later. The reforms focused on the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005. They terminated the centuries-old three-fold operation of the office Lord Chancellor as the head of the judiciary, Speaker of the House of Lords and a cabinet minister. They created a Supreme Court, a more independent system for appointing judges and a judiciary more independent and separate from government.

In these interviews with seven of the most senior office holders, we hear the inside stories of how the reforms came about, and a range of subtly different views on how judicial independence has been affected in the early years of the reforms.

The interviews appear in overlapping chronological order:

Lord Woolf
Lord Chief Justice 2000-05

Lord Falconer

The research findings challenged conventional wisdom about the relationship between the branches of government and the best way to protect judicial independence. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, has publicly referenced the research findings on a number of occasions in support of a more proactive approach, saying in a lecture that 'judicial independence is best served by more, not less, day-to-day engagement with government and Parliament.' Likewise, on 7 November 2016, Lord Hodge, Supreme Court Justice, argued for greater engagement between politicians and judges referring in support to the project and its 'warning that the disengagement of politicians from the justice system could be the greatest threat to judicial independence in future'. 
 
The Chair of the House of Commons Justice Committee, Sir Alan Beith MP, explained that the research had been 'very helpful to the Justice Committee at a time when we were actively developing the engagement of the judiciary with Parliament in ways which did not threaten that independence.' Nick Walker, the Clerk to the Justice Committee also noted that 'the research has provided welcome legitimation of the approach of Parliament and its committees to their relations with the judiciary, especially in supporting the idea that the judiciary should be less nervous about engaging with us. This is also supported by the important empirical evidence assembled and analysed demonstrating the increasing frequency and variety of judicial appearances before select committees, combined with the fact that the constitution has not collapsed as a result.'
 
Nor was the impact limited to England and Wales. in the speech by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Sir Declan Morgan, at the opening of the legal year in September 2015, he drew on the research findings to argue for changes the arrangements for managing the courts: 'A recent study in the UK concluded that enhanced judicial independence and greater accountability are often two sides of the same coin, and highlighted the benefits of more active and transparent involvement of the Judiciary in the management of court business. I would, therefore, encourage the Department of Justice to give serious consideration to the possibility of legislating for a non-ministerial department in the next Assembly mandate.'</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5CC7F529-E333-4B46-8FFF-4164240FABAC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>? Judicial independence is a political achievement. That needs greater recognition, by the judiciary, but also by its multiple guardians in the Executive and in Parliament.
? Judges now enjoy greater power over judicial appointments, discipline, deployment, the courts service. They should be more accountable for the greater power they wield. They must give a fuller account of their stewardship to government, Parliament, the legal profession, the media, the wider public.
? Judicial independence is not a fixed concept. The core of judicial independence is decisional independence: the need for individual judges to be able to decide cases according to the law, free from any improper pressure. But around that core, everything else is negotiable, and continuously being negotiated
? Greater separation of the judiciary has increased the need for regular and close consultation with the other branches of government. Otherwise there is a risk of increasing lack of interest and disengagement by the political branches
? The pay freeze and reductions in judicial pensions were not a threat to judicial independence. But to ensure that the government pays competitive salaries, the convention that judges cannot return to practice should be abandoned.
? Parliament is a central guardian of judicial independence, with the new Select Committees more constant and systematic guardians than were the law lords. The judiciary deserve credit for their willingness to engage with parliamentary committees: it is a valuable two way dialogue.
? The judicial appointments commission is now an efficient recruitment agency but the judiciary has too much influence in the selection process while the Lord Chancellor's role over individual selections has been reduced to a rubber stamp. Attempts to improve judicial diversity are undermined by this marginalisation. The Lord Chancellor should be given real choice in relation to senior appointments, with a short list of three names. If that raises concerns about political bias, the appointees should be invited to pre-appointment scrutiny hearings by a joint parliamentary committee, to test their independence.
? Many judges are still in mourning for the old-style office of Lord Chancellor. But overall the judiciary and judicial independence have emerged stronger from the 2005 changes, with the inclusion of Tribunals into the judiciary and the courts system, a more independent and visible Supreme Court, and greater autonomy of the Lord Chief Justice as the new head of a more professionalised judiciary.
? Judicial accountability is also stronger, in particular through the frequent appearances by the LCJ and other judges before parliamentary committees. But the LCJ needs to submit an annual report, and parliamentary committees need to learn to be less deferential.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We were invited to give a presentation to the Judicial Executive Board, the Judiciary's 'Cabinet' (the Lord Chief Justice and his Heads of Division etc).
