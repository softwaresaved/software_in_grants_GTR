In reality this disease which leads to almost 4,000 deaths per year in UK hospitals (4-times more than MRSA) is present worldwide and is a growing burden to public health. The disease affects mostly the elderly and particularly those in hospitals and who are undergoing antibiotic therapy. The only current treatment is the use of antibiotics and no vaccine which could prevent infection by C. difficile is available. In an effort to design and evaluate a suitable vaccine to C. difficile this project will evaluate a novel vaccine which could be taken either orally as a solution, soft tablet or fast-dissolving film. The technology supporting this form of vaccine delivery is already developed and, based on our work to date, should work in humans. The technology is highly innovative, patented and goes beyond the current strategies being developed by industry. As a prelude to evaluation in humans this project will use a rigid program of evaluation to identify the most suitable dose and regimen to prove efficacy. If successful this vaccine to C. difficile would be patient friendly and heat-stable both of which are attributes much needed in future second-generation vaccines. We are partnered with a major industry partner with a long history in vaccine manufacture and this adds to the probability of long-term project delivery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Clostridium difficile (CD) is the most common cause of nosocomial antibiotic associated diarrhea in the UK. The leading vaccines currently under development are based on parenteral delivery of toxoids, which generate strong systemic Ab responses but weak mucosal responses. Moreover, protection is found only to primary infection and not to relapse.

We have very good evidence that an additional spore-associated colonization factor (CotE) exists in CD and use of this protein in a vaccine formulation will produce a more robust CD vaccine. The CotE antigen will be used in vaccination approaches either in combination with existing toxoids using parenteral delivery or in combination with bacterial (B. subtilis) spores.

B. subtilis spores that express the C-terminus of toxoid A (CDTA) have been shown to confer 75% protection to both primary infection and full protection to relapse in hamsters following oral immunization. Mucosal immunity (sIgA) is of paramount importance for robust protection and decolonisation. We have previously demonstrated this can be achieved using mucosal delivery of B. subtilis spores. We will co-express CotE with CDTA using B. subtilis spores and evaluate immunity and protection (primary &amp;amp; relapse) using mouse and hamster models of infection. The project will identify delivery routes (oral &amp;amp; sub-lingual) as well as live vs killed bacterial spores and we will validate a more robust vaccine that protects against hypervirulent CD strains.

We will also evaluate CotE in parenteral toxoid-based vaccines and so provide two validated vaccination approaches, a parenteral vaccine that will be superior to those under current development and a mucosal vaccine that is heat-stable and potentially more patient friendly. 

Our strategy is to develop a new and innovative vaccine for this disease. The inclusion of a major vaccine company in this proposal could provide a route to long-term exploitation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?:

a) Patients and the elderly
b) Hospitals
b) The livestock and poultry industries

How will they benefit from this research?:

Patients. 
Currently no vaccine exists yet there is an immediate need in developed countries. A vaccine could be considered for people planning to visit a hospital for surgery or related procedure. There is also a need for elderly people to receive this vaccine as a precautionary measure. This is a niche market but in all likelihood would be adopted worldwide since C. difficile is now being recorded in developing countries (e.g., Vietnam &amp;amp; China) where health care provision has improved substantially in the last decade. 

Hospitals and Health care providers
The current financial burden of C. difficile infection to the health services of Europe and the USA is estimated as $7.6 bn/annum. In the UK the cost of C. difficile infection adds ~&amp;pound;4,000/patient and, with some 50,0000 cases/annum, an annual cost of &amp;pound;200m/year (J. Hosp. Infection. 1996.v34 p23-30). Antibiotic therapy not only accentuates the problem but increases the risk of developing resistance and exhausting the few remaining antibiotics of clinical use. Vaccines would provide a rationale treatment and would make a significant impact on the financial costs of controlling this disease.

Livestock and poultry industry
Although unrelated to the MRC's remit it should be mentioned that C. difficile is also a disease that afflicts the farming industry and the numbers of cases in animals is progressively increasing. The precise monetary burden has not accurately been defined primarily because animals are also afflicted by other diseases. However, we have been approached by some veterinary vaccine companies (Merck SD/Intervet and Boehringer Ingelheim) where there is an interest in developing a animal C. difficile vaccine. Clearly, in this case the use of spores is of particular interest due to its heat stability and robustness.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>474327</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2A9B430A-7F4C-4ADB-90F2-75A536851ED3"><gtr:id>2A9B430A-7F4C-4ADB-90F2-75A536851ED3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Increased toxin expression in a Clostridium difficile mfd mutant.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5d3c7934e7532dd91514fc0b3f20539f"><gtr:id>5d3c7934e7532dd91514fc0b3f20539f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Willing SE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2180</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9ED8744E-A1EE-42E9-AD17-0758D4E1A855"><gtr:id>9ED8744E-A1EE-42E9-AD17-0758D4E1A855</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mucosal Antibodies to the C-terminus of Toxin A Prevent Colonization of Clostridium difficile.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Infection and immunity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5f3a9650161d59dd63849f58790b2a9a"><gtr:id>5f3a9650161d59dd63849f58790b2a9a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hong HA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0019-9567</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A55EFF57-30B8-4DCB-8FB4-6373A360636B"><gtr:id>A55EFF57-30B8-4DCB-8FB4-6373A360636B</gtr:id><gtr:title>The spore-associated protein BclA1 affects the susceptibility of animals to colonization and infection by Clostridium difficile.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/64f731d82e3d93381bc441f8e7d80933"><gtr:id>64f731d82e3d93381bc441f8e7d80933</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Phetcharaburanin J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-382X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K015354/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
