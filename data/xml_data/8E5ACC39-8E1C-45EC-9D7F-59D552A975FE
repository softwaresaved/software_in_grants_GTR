Lanarkshire</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J020729/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project aims to investigate the potential for and means of implementing evidence, (drawing upon formal research studies, practitioner wisdom and user and carer perspectives) about outcomes based working in the context of the home support re-ablement model adopted in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. There is a need to develop outcomes-based working in relation to re-ablement services, which are being promoted throughout the UK (CSED, 2007). Further, re-ablement has been recognised as achieving significant savings for local authorities (PSSRU, 2010).&amp;nbsp; Taken together embedding an outcomes approach within re-ablement may assist in providing effective home care services within a context of diminishing resources, increased prevalence of long term conditions and an ageing population.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project utilises a mixed methodological approach, including key informant interviews, focus groups and expert group events. The project aims to build on existing knowledge exchange activity to establish current practice and understanding of outcomes and re-ablement services locally, explore applicability of existing evidence, establish challenges in existing approach to outcomes and re-ablement and through this process to generate new insights which will be formulated into guidance and tools for further implementation locally and nationally.&amp;nbsp; University of Strathclyde has granted full ethical approval for the project.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of the research will include users of services and their carers, particularly in health and social care and housing, which are moving towards outcome based working. Where outcomes are embedded, service users benefit from approaches that more actively involve them in identifying their outcomes, building on their strengths and capacities. Carers benefit from improved communication and a greater sense of clarity about the purpose of services and support. While homecare re-ablement also explicitly aims to maximise independence, there has tended to be an almost exclusive focus on functional outcomes with less attention to the quality of life of service users. Embedding outcomes will mean that quality of life outcomes are taken into consideration, so that factors like social isolation are considered and addressed. 

In general, staff have reported benefits from outcomes based working in that it restores relationship based approaches to practice and promotes more meaningful engagement, rather than prescriptive tick box approaches. Re-ablement home care staff within North Lanarkshire have identified that they enjoy the new way of working, gaining satisfaction from the positive changes in service users, they have identified 'backlash' as an issue. This means that staff have encountered resistance from some service users and carers who have grown accustomed to traditional home care which performs tasks and does things to people rather than working with people to enhance their skills and capacities. Outcomes based working offers some potential to manage these tensions, involving a negotiated process of assessment and planning with the person and their carer, to agree what is to be achieved and how that will happen. There is also real potential to include staff from more traditional home care services to work in a more enabling way with service users, and outcomes based planning can support this. 

There is potential for homecare re-ablement services to benefit from embedding outcomes in so far as there is increasing pressure on providers to be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of their interventions from the perspective of service users and carers (see e.g. Glendinning et al, 2008). Outcomes based working not only provides a means of more constructive engagement with individuals, but in addition, the records which are produced from individual planning and review can be collated and aggregated up to demonstrate impact, fulfilling a range of requirements including service planning, commissioning and accountability and scrutiny. 

At a wider level, there is potential for local authorities and the public sector generally to benefit from this approach. Outcomes based working improves communication between individuals at the frontline and provides clarity of purpose about the role of services, which in turn improves their efficacy and relevance. The focus on supporting people to be active in achieving the outcomes they have identified as important also means that there is less reliance on providing services, and that consideration is also given to the person's role as well as the role of natural and community based supports. In the face of budgetary constraint and demographic pressures, this shift will be critical in sustaining public services. Local councils are also under pressure to demonstrate outcomes for accountability, scrutiny and performance management purposes. While North Lanarkshire is en route to being able to demonstrate outcomes from care management, it will be necessary for different parts of the system to be outcomes focused to achieve full benefits. It is envisaged that the focus on re-ablement in this project will be the first stage in bringing on board the wider home care service. As many local authorities throughout the UK are currently introducing, embedding or extending homecare re-ablement, there will be considerable interest in the outputs from this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19345</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Project partnership with Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE692E8B-8A2F-434E-88D3-F304B9DE572D</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services worked with the research team and assisted/contributed to the project outcomes</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>North Lanarkshire Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Project partnership with North Lanarkshire Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>BFBD121E-7BEE-4791-A370-292E6B13E529</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>North Lanarkshire Council worked with the research team and assisted/contributed to the project outcomes</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>See previous submission no update since then.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AB2EBBF3-46C6-4AF4-80BE-8C8D98C63484</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>? The importance of the motivation of staff on the project to work to promote was noted to ensure effective outcomes.
? Engagement with individuals emerges as a critical factor to successful reablement. People using home support services and their families reported that they wanted to be more involved in decision-making, and that they wanted a flexible approach, recognising that many health conditions might vary day to day. 
? The importance of investment in staff training and support was a key theme. In addition to identifying the importance of extra time with service users, this project found that staff valued being able to build working relationships and trust, through regular contact with each other at team meetings, which improved communication and knowledge across the team. 
? The literature urges caution on establishing distinct reablement services alongside existing mainstream task and time services and the findings of this project support this view
? An overemphasis on hours saved can encourage a tendency to select only those most likely to be deemed successful against this measure for reablement.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>see narrative impact study</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4942C0DB-6F4C-4484-B52E-6BA33E278A84</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J020729/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
