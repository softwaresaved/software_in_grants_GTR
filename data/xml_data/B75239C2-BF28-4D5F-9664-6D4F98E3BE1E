The HTCs are working with patient groups and clinicians on identifying unmet clinical needs in these areas. An aim of the new Medical Image Analysis Network is to bring together imaging scientists with different skills sets and experiences to consider how technological advances in how images are acquired and images (and associated information) are analysed can be applied to solve some of these problems. A purpose of the Network is to encourage new collaborations to be set up between academic healthcare technologists, clinicians and industry partners to develop and evaluate new solutions. We anticipate that Network members will jointly work on some of the hardest medical image analysis problems there are today. The hope is that the resulting research will lead to new image-based biomarkers which allow earlier detection of disease, better stratification of disease so that the most appropriate therapy can be selected for a patient, and new image-based quantitative tools to increase the success of interventions and therapies and improve the overall well-being of patients with these conditions.

How will the Network achieve this goal? The Network will aim to encourage the development of new collaborations through workshops, joint meetings with other networks/organisations, small scale feasibility studies, Clinical Readiness events and Challenge competitions which will be open to the broader imaging research community. The hub for promotion of Network activities, dissemination of network outputs, and recruitment of new members (particularly from academia and industry not already involved in the HTCs) will be the Network website which will also act as an information source for imaging researchers interested in these clinical areas.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main non-academic beneficiaries of Network activities are patients, clinicians, establishments where treatment happens, and companies that make healthcare products.

Clinical Impact: 
The HTC partners will take the lead on this. The HTCs will use their knowledge gleaned from interactions with NHS Patient &amp;amp; Public Involvement groups, and clinicians linked to their HTC to pose new challenges to the Medical Image Analysis network members that may lead to technical solutions to some of the most challenging problems in diagnosis and treatment of patients with high morbidity conditions. Clinical impact at network award end will be measured in terms of the degree of active engagement of clinicians in the network and as partners on feasibility studies and grant submissions.

Commercial Impact: 
The technology area of interest of this Network is likely to be of great interest to industry (imaging companies, medtech companies who use imaging for guidance, and medical diagnostic companies). The timeline from concept to product is typically of the order of 5-7 years in this area, so it unlikely that there will commercial success stories to report by award end. Commercial impact at network award end may be measured in terms of the degree of active engagement and support of industry in the network and as partners on grant submissions. Intellectual Property may also be generated in feasibility projects and protection will be managed following the standard practices of the institutions involved. The initial network members are collectively well-connected with all the major global imaging companies (GE, Philips, Siemens, Toshiba), other key global players with specialist interests such as Medtronic, GSK, Tomtec, Samsung and have research links with SMEs of various sizes including university spin-outs (Mirada Medical, Ixico, Intelligent Ultrasound) and the potential to connect with other companies via member links to Academic Health Science Networks (Oxford, UCL Partners, Imperial College Health Partners, South London, Yorkshire and Humber) and biotech networks (such as the Oxford Biotech Network (OBN)). Additionally, the HTCs may have other imaging companies in their own networks who may be interested in participating in network activities and research projects. 

Societal Impact: 
The Network aims to make its own unique contribution to improving healthcare products and services, and through this, improve the quality of life of patients with high morbidity conditions. Direct benefits of network outputs are likely to be realised in the medium term. However, the network aims to contribute to societal needs for better solutions for rapid and early detection of conditions, and personalised surgery to improve patient outcome, as well as to reduce the cost of healthcare by developing healthcare technology solutions that will encourage clinical adoption of lower-cost imaging technology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151513</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MedIAN Cardivascular scientific workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>298B120C-487B-45F0-AC88-988FF2999823</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A scientific work aimed at engagement between image analysis experts and cardiovascular medicine researchers/clinicians to discuss challenges and new opportunities to work together.
