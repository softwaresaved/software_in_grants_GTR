These have provided new insights into the thinking and experiences of everyday life as viewed by mostly ordinary soldiers, rather than the officer class. Mentality and outlook in these drawings gives us a picture of the Great War that contrasts starkly to Home Front propaganda. It also gives us insights into what the men at the Front considered to be the misconceptions of their families and the public back home about what exactly they were doing. 
General publics have found this fascinating and original, gaining insights into how cartoons can be used as an accessible, and relatively democratic historical record.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By looking at soldier records more closely, to present alternative viewpoints on WW1, and insights into endurance, courage, humour, and outlooks of the ordinary member of the armed forces.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E4CCBFB6-C0A3-49B4-B0BA-96D9D5A8FAC9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01nhwgx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L503617/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
