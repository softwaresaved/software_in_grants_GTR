We draw on the resources of phenomenology to make clear the underlying structure of experiences of powerlessness. We further draw on a neglected source in the history of Christian ethics in order to recover an understanding of what Thomas Aquinas described as the theological virtues: faith, hope and love (or charity - caritas). Our hypothesis is that a suitably adapted understanding of the theological virtues can provide the core of an ethics of powerlessness that can in turn provide guidance in navigating the challenges of diminished agency - even for those who do not share Aquinas' specifically Christian faith. We apply the results of our investigation to the contemporary public policy crisis concerning ethical care for aged or terminally ill patients in NHS settings.

Standard systems of ethics are united by a common structural feature: they are characteristically addressed to agents who are empowered to act in response to the demands of their situation. These standard ethical theories then teach the empowered agent something about how to exercise their power and agency. But human lives are often visited by circumstances where the power to act is profoundly diminished. Such circumstances include serious illness, depression, addiction and aging. They also include situations in which carers find themselves powerless to improve the circumstances of those for whom they care. In all these cases, we find ourselves beset by acute feelings of powerlessness. The standard ethical theories are ill-equipped to address these challenges. How do I act ethically when there is little or nothing that I can do to change my circumstances, or those of someone for whom I care, and yet feel there must be something I can and should do? Does ethics have anything to say to persons who find themselves in these situations?

The need for an ethics of powerlessness has been set in sharp relief by recent crises of public policy and public trust, particularly in connection with care for the aged and the terminally ill. Until 2012, the so-called &amp;quot;Liverpool Care Pathway&amp;quot; (LCP) provided guidance to doctors and other carers regarding ethical treatment at the end of life. Following several months of public controversy, the Department of Health confirmed in July 2013 that the LCP will be phased out over the next twelve months. To date no successor framework has been endorsed. Scandals such as the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust crisis have highlighted the ethical dangers in this area; but what would it be to get things right? From the perspective of the patient, standard injunctions to self-reliance, self-control and will-power are often counter-productive because they presuppose exactly the sort of robust agency that has been lost. From the perspective of carers, emphasis on such terms as 'compassion', 'vulnerability', 'empowerment' and 'spiritual care', which feature prominently in the relevant guidelines and policy documents, is often insufficient because these concepts are difficult to pin down. We need a fresh approach. 

Benefits of the research include:

. An account of diminished agency - in general and with reference to palliative care.
. An account of faith, hope and love as contemporary virtues of powerlessness across religious and secular contexts. 
. Improved public policy and care delivery in end-of-life contexts by fostering better understanding of powerlessness, the ethical challenges it raises, and the key terms in which policy documents and practice guidelines conceptualise the issues - such as 'vulnerability', 'empowerment', 'compassion', 'care for the whole person' or 'spiritual care'.
. Advances in on-going debates in virtue theory, virtue epistemology and the philosophy of agency.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our Ethics of Powerlessness project will apply resources from the humanities to a pressing challenge in ethics and public policy. It directly answers recent calls for fundamental research into the experience of dying and the ethics of palliative care. The events organised by the project and the research outputs themselves will directly inform the on-going review of the practices of care at the end of life.

In July 2013 the Department of Health published the so-called Neuberger Report (NR): More Care, Less Pathway: Review of the Liverpool Care Pathway. The NR called for the phasing out of the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP), which since 2003 had provided care-guidelines for patients deemed to be dying. The Report also highlighted the lack of specific guidance for nurses caring for patients at the end of life and the need for the Nursing and Midwifery Council to provide such guidance as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, the NR issued an urgent call for research: in particular, it recommends a) that the government fund research, not just into the 'biology of dying' but 'into the experience of dying, because there are critical and legitimate social and health objectives and benefits that must be understood in how patients, their relatives or carers experience care at the end of life' (1.26); and b) a 'collective commitment and plan of action for the whole health and care system to put greater emphasis on caring and compassion' (3.10).

The Ethics of Powerlessness project directly takes up these challenges. It draws on the resources of phenomenology in order to advance understanding of the experiences of terminally ill patients; and it recovers neglected resources from the history of Christian ethics in looking for ethical guidance for care. A fundamental aim of the research is to gain clarity about the &amp;quot;theological virtues&amp;quot;: faith, hope and love (or charity - caritas). These virtues are often invoked in the charters of Christian hospices, but it is has been unclear how they can be applied in guiding concrete practices of care. Some healthcare professionals also express unease about applying these Christian ideas in our multicultural society. This makes our inquiry into the conditions under which faith, hope and love can be construed as secular virtues all the more important to help policy-makers in the face of the pressing demand for improved end-of-life care. 

The main beneficiaries would be: 

. Policy-makers in the field of palliative care, through better understanding of the ethical challenges associated with powerlessness at the end of life, together with an improved understanding of ethical responses to those challenges. 
. Patients in end-of-life situations, through improved self-understanding and empowerment in the difficult palliative care decision-making process. 
. Their relatives and carers: through improved understanding of profoundly diminished agency and of the potential for faith, hope and love as virtues of powerlessness. 
. Medical staff: as stated by the NR, 'care of the dying requires not only substantial technical knowledge and clinical skill but above all it needs excellent communication skills' (p. 10). Improved understanding of experiences of powerlessness will enable health care professionals to communicate sensitively with patients and their relatives.

Benefits will be delivered by means of:

. Consultations with our network of patients, health-care professionals and policy-makers
. Liaising with hospice networks and workforce training
. A series of six public workshops and round tables held at Essex
. Three end-of-year conferences held in London
. Green papers presenting digests of the research and analysing changes in palliative care policies and guidelines 
. A website publicizing research material and results, with pod casts of the various events 
. Media exposure, including radio broadcasting</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>529615</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Feedback on NICE Draft guidelines: Care of Dying Adults in the Last Days of Life</gtr:description><gtr:id>22FA3F1B-8CA6-4B9D-AA84-C43CA670E7CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Amendment to recommendation 1.1.5.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>None.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We gave feedback on the NICE Draft Guidelines on 'Care of Dying Adults in the Last Days of Life'.

In particular ID #29: 'action: in the definition of palliative care, replace &amp;quot;live as actively as possible&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;live as well as possible&amp;quot;'. There is no reason to suppose that maximising activity in the last days of life is suitable for all patients in palliative care. Some may seek comfort in the company of relatives or friends, in meditation or in reflecting on their life. The ultimate goal should be that patients live as well as possible, not as actively as possible, to the end of their life. This significant change will keep open different avenues for palliative care.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Ethics of Powerlessness' website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D5F1B3B8-E19D-472E-A33D-935815CDEF18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the dedicated EoP website, which went live at the beginning of December.

a) A Medical Humanities Workshop on end-of-life issues (see Green Paper on 'Experiences of Powerlessness in End-of-Life Care'). We have introduced a new notion, that of the 'power to be oneself', to help understand what is under threat in such experiences, and how to alleviate, at least partly, such threats.
 
b) An Academic Workshop on the structure of experiences of powerlessness (see Green Paper on 'The Phenomenology of Powerlessness). We drew from the empirical data gathered in the first workshop as well as from the tools of phenomenology to analyse the structure of experiences of powerlessness, and to develop the concept of the power to be oneself by distinguishing between two levels of application: 
i) first order: the power to be oneself applied routinely to navigate everyday situations;
ii) second order: the power to be oneself applied in the case of breakdowns of everyday situations (such as severe illness or injury, trauma etc). 

c) Our end-of-year conference on 'Virtue Theory and the Medio-Passive Agent' which took place in London on 17-18th of June, 2016. This event helped open up a field of research at the intersection of virtue theory, the philosophy of agency and medical ethics. The material presented both reflected and has since shaped our own research.

From July 2016 until now, we have focused on the theological virtues and have explored their potential as virtues of powerlessness in two different contexts: 

a) an academic workshop on 'Faith, Hope and Love in the Theological Tradition' (see Green Paper on 'Faith, Hope and Love in the Theological Tradition'). We identified four key questions: 
i) are the theological virtues irrational, and if so, does their irrationality prevent from being virtues, and thus from contributing to the good life?; 
ii) What is the exercise of agency involved in the theological virtues, and is it robust enough to allow for the agent being held responsible for what they do? 
iii) Are the theological virtues needed for the exercise of the moral virtues? Can they be secularised? 
iv) Can virtues of radical dependency remain ethically appropriate if one denies the truth of such dependency? 

b) An academic workshop on 'Critical Perspectives on the Theological Virtues'. Our key findings are as follows: 
i) major objections to the idea of the theological virtues can be reduced to two forms: objections to the theological aspect of the theological virtues, and objections to the claim that these virtues are virtues at all, on the grounds that they are irrational. 
ii) there is a fault line between remedial and palliative conceptions of what is needed to address our experiences of powerlessness. If what is needed is merely remedial, then there is no role for the theological virtues because the cardinal virtues and the practices that follow from them are enough to restore the good life. If what is needed is palliative (because the situation cannot be redressed), then the theological virtues have an important role to play to ensure that life is lived in the best possible way.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the 2015 Medical Humanities Workshop closed Round Table the notion of the 'power to be oneself' was unanimously viewed as having significant explanatory power and potential practical implications. The participants of this Roundtable included general practitioners, patients, nurses, a physiotherapist and spiritual healer, members of various organisations such as Health Watch Essex, and researchers. A sociologist asked us for permission to use the concept to make sense of the practice of writing life narratives at the end of life. 
In the first 2016 workshop the notion of the power to be oneself was picked up by three different researchers in the context of psycho-therapeutic practices. 
The two academic workshops of November 2016 and February 2017 made significant contributions to ongoing interdisciplinary debates about the theological virtues and their place in ethical life. The Green Papers were deemed to provide excellent teaching material.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F974BE35-B55E-48CD-938A-FC6846DE8B57</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://powerlessness.essex.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation
