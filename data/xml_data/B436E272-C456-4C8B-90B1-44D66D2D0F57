Better information is needed to assist in the planning and delivery of services for this important group. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>While more data has become available recently, we need to know about: trends in childhood disability; the numbers of disabled children by geographical region and among some particular groups; why a higher proportion of disabled than non-disabled children live with a lone parent or a parent who is also disabled. We also need to know more about the relationship between socio-economic disadvantage and childhood disability, and how it can be explained. &lt;/p>

This conference was attended by national and international participants, including parents of disabled children, academics from a range of disciplines, policy makers (national and local government), practitioners providng services for families, representatives from organisations representing the interests of families, law students.

Law students attending the event were very interested in the health impacts we described. This was new information to many of them. Some international students from low income countries asked for information about the association of child disability with socio-economic disadvantage in low income and we were able to provide them with sources of information to use to assist in their work when they return home. We were also able to discuss findings with some parents who felt that the information together with that from other presentations, would help them in their effort to secure greater resources for their children.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.law.cf.ac.uk/newsandevents/events2.php?id=582</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Disabled children and disabled parents in the same family : what is the evidence and how might it be explained?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>69642A40-7E7C-4443-95FC-5F68B43E3B04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar paper during ESRC Social Science Festival 2011

We have increased the knowledge of policy makers, services planners and providers, and organisations and individuals working on behalf of disabled children and their families in relation to i) the nature of the association between socio-economic disadvantage and childhood disability ii) the characteristics and circumstances of disabled children and their families iii) the need for policies and interventions which seek to reduce children's exposure to socio-economic disadvantage in early childhood. Our findings informed the basis for an invited chapter for the Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer for England, 2012. The aim of this report is to provide an assessment of the state of the public's health and to advise government on where action is required. Our study findings have been incorporated into professional education programmes in higher education institutions, including in the teaching programme for LLM students at Cardiff Law School, for Social Work Students at the University of Bristol, Masters in Public Health Students and Undergraduate Medical Students at the University of Warwick. In addition, our work has been used as part of a YouTube video for undergraduates in psychology and disability studies. Study findings were tweeted by the NHS England Head of Patient Participation and blogged by Dr Jenny Morris, prominent disability rights campaigner and author to increase awareness of the link between childhood disability and socio-economic disadvantage. Organisations say they have used this information to inform practice, political lobbying, respond to public debates and press reports. We have contributed to cross-disciplinary discussions on the human rights of disabled children, particularly rights under the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This has contributed to the identification of barriers and solutions to ensure the rights of disabled children. Our research was used to inform a funding application from a user-led organisation of families with children with learning disabilities. We have assisted this organisation to apply for research funding to undertake a scoping study to improve provision for children with learning disabilities and their families, in line with the recommendations of the Chief Medical Officer's report. We have increased knowledge among those providing services for disabled children and their families. Community paediatricians, lawyers and law students, local service managers, and carer organisations say they feel better informed and will use the information in their work. Individual parents attending many of our public engagement events tell us they have valued the information and have shared it with other parents. Information provided to the Office for Disability Issues was incorporated in the major evidence review Fulfilling Potential: Working together to Empower Disabled People, which was written to inform the government's disability strategy. Groups and individuals who have told us our findings have had an impact on their knowledge and activities are: organisations representing the interests of disabled children: general children's charities and organisations working to support disabled children and their parents/carers; individual parents; professionals working with disabled children e.g. hospital and community paediatricians, social workers, nurses working with disabled children; policy-makers in national and local government; a Peer in the House of Lords.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>99B9A3AA-CA88-4C65-A474-13D560D9670E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>House of Lords debate : child development</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ACE14639-34AD-4CB1-960F-75EDF868540F</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7BEEA653-22FC-40C1-8DEC-575F260CEDD3"><gtr:id>7BEEA653-22FC-40C1-8DEC-575F260CEDD3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Children and parents with limiting long-term illness and disability (LLTI/D) in the UK : to what extent does parental LLTI/D precede or follow parenting a child with LLTI/D</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b1d2b92a8d9de8680eda0e25663ac1bb"><gtr:id>b1d2b92a8d9de8680eda0e25663ac1bb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clare Blackburn (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/183A55E9-BCA6-4391-A82C-4BAA15047587"><gtr:id>183A55E9-BCA6-4391-A82C-4BAA15047587</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disabling chronic conditions in childhood and socioeconomic disadvantage: a systematic review and meta-analyses of observational studies.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ open</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b1245181d373ffa16c2178e6f5eb4c03"><gtr:id>b1245181d373ffa16c2178e6f5eb4c03</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Spencer NJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2044-6055</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/47D68FF6-5B0D-45AF-B164-CED799506060"><gtr:id>47D68FF6-5B0D-45AF-B164-CED799506060</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is the onset of disabling chronic conditions in later childhood associated with exposure to social disadvantage in earlier childhood?
