Foremost amongst these is the revelation that the atmospheric CO2 content was about one-third lower (roughly 80ppmV) during the Last Glacial Maximum than during the warmer period of the past 10 thousand years. Thus, it is widely believed that changes in atmospheric CO2 strongly amplified glacial-interglacial climate change. Although a clear explanation has yet to emerge for the observed CO2 decline during glacials and rise during interglacials, mass balance arguments clearly point to the ocean exchange as the primary modulator of the CO2 changes on these time scales. Recent studies have pointed to the Southern Ocean due to the tight coupling between carbon dioxide levels and climate in the southern hemisphere high latitudes. One prevailing model involving the SO envisions that at the end of the last glacial cycle (deglacial) climate reorganisation, the reduction in sea ice cover and strengthening wind fields may have stirred up deep ocean waters rich in carbon and nutrients to the surface releasing CO2 that has been stored in the deep ocean during the glacial period. However, this model presents a paradox. In the modern SO, the physical release of CO2 is roughly compensated by the uptake of carbon by algae during photosynthesis at the sea surface utilising the nutrients that accompany CO2 in the resurfacing deep waters. Therefore for the CO2 release model to work conditions in SO should have been unfavourable for the biological uptake allowing globally significant CO2 efflux to occur.
In the proposal we hypothesize that one potential factor that could have constrained biological CO2 uptake in the SO is the dearth of Fe during algal growth. The substantial decline in dust inputs (important source of Fe) during the deglacial recorded in Anatrctic ice cores lends support to this idea. Therefore, we propose to investigate the role of productivity on CO2 efflux from the SO during the last deglaciation by investigating the nature and magnitude of marine productivity, relative macronutrient utilisation (nitrate and silicic acid), micronutrient (Fe &amp;amp; Zn) bio-availability and in a carefully selected set of marine sediment cores covering this period. We propose to apply state-of-art geochemical and isotopic tools recently developed including silicon and nitrogen isotopes as proxies for macronutrient utilisation and diatom-bound trace metals as tracers of Fe and Zn biological availability in combination with more conventional proxies of productivity and dust inputs. By doing so, we propose to address a fundamental and lingering question in Earth System Science- that is &amp;quot;What are the controls on glacial-interglacial CO2 change?&amp;quot;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impacts and Beneficiaries
(1) The project aims at contributing to a fundamental question in Earth Systems Science: what natural mechanisms control atmospheric CO2 concentrations on time scales of hundreds to thousands of years? We hope to contribute to the understanding the role of the ocean in modulating the atmospheric CO2 levels. The new understanding and knowledge of past nutrient cycling will inform models of ocean biogeochemistry and carbon cycle and improve our predictive capabilities of future global change. Our project will therefore benefit disciplinary and interdisciplinary environmental science researches in UK and Europe and in particular the modelling community. 

(2) Fe fertilisation of the ocean is proposed as a means to sequester carbon into the ocean as a mitigating strategy for atmospheric CO2 increase and global warming. Large scale Fe-fertilisation experiments have been conducted in the SO to understand biological response to such manipulations. The efficiency and long-term ecological impact of such manipulations remain uncertain partly because of the short time scales of these experiments. The proposed project aims to document and understand how natural changes in Fe fertilisation in the past impacted biological productivity and CO2 exchange in the Southern ocean- a region that is regarded as a hot spot for carbon cycle changes. Companies and Researchers involved in ocean carbon sequestration will benefit from the new understanding of the long term impact of Fe availability on productivity and the marine carbon cycle.

(3) The novel proxies we propose to use have application well beyond paleoceanography. If diatom-bound trace metal reflects the bio-availability of metals during diatom growth then this can be directly applied to pollution studies. The application of diatom-bound trace metals &amp;amp; isotopes are highly relevant to studies documenting the history of human induced-changes in nutrient and metal inputs in the aquatic realm and to understand their impacts. Therefore the skills and methodology refined and developed through this project also has much wider relevance to environmental and pollution sciences. 

Plan to impact

Academic beneficiaries and modellers will be informed of our project and findings through:
- Presentation of research results at national and international Paleoceanography or Earth System Science conferences to inform current - Presentation of research results at national and international Paleoceanography or Earth System Science conferences (example, AGU) to inform communities researching marine nutrient cycling and carbon cycle.
- Publication of results in high impact peer-reviewed international scientific journals. The PI and named researcher have published several papers on marine nutrient cycling 
- Communication and dissemination of the findings from the ODP core used in the proposed study with the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) members.
- Communication on our project, results and findings on the University and International GEOTRACES websites.
- Organisation of a workshop with the theme 'Linking present oceanic processes with paleo-records&amp;quot;. We propose to conduct this workshop in association with International GEOTRACES programme. This synergy is possible because the PI is also a participant in the UK GEOTRACES (NERC Consortium). 

The carbon sequestration and marine pollution sectors will be reached in various complementary ways:
 - Attendance to workshops on nutrient cycling and ocean fertilisation.
- Work in connection with the ECCI - Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation (previously called Edinburgh Centre on Climate Change) which has the role to develop original CO2 mitigation solutions, disseminate scientific results to the public and to inform policy makers and regulators (http://www.climatechangecentre.org.uk/).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>350290</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project has just ended and currently we are interpreting and writing publications</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2005</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B88249B0-5ED0-4DB1-914A-89AD54F1FB7B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has just started</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project has just started</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D70F131C-B2CA-429A-B7E0-F2087989DE12</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5B777C57-3BFE-444E-B945-CE2A7A9458DA"><gtr:id>5B777C57-3BFE-444E-B945-CE2A7A9458DA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Silica burial enhanced by iron limitation in oceanic upwelling margins</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature Geoscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/246c3a49289a97dcbe2b41e698ef243c"><gtr:id>246c3a49289a97dcbe2b41e698ef243c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pichevin L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5ED96A7C-4EE0-4AA7-BF93-6DBF44929810"><gtr:id>5ED96A7C-4EE0-4AA7-BF93-6DBF44929810</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cryptic ecotypes of G. bulloides as potential bias for proxy reconstructions of past climate</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature Geoscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a9f17d0e1050dfb60e7a451e5bf85c3f"><gtr:id>a9f17d0e1050dfb60e7a451e5bf85c3f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Raja Ganeshram (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/J02371X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62DCC1BF-B512-4BDB-A0C3-02BC17E15F6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biogeochemical Cycles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>723BA0F8-3ECD-4E2A-A39E-44936EAC1517</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean Circulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
