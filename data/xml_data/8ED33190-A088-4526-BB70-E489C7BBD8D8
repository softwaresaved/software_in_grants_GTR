When they were written down, medieval songs were rarely gathered together in 'song-books' but occupied a remarkable array of manuscript contexts, from books of sermons and devotional writing, books on law and medicine, romances, historical and political texts, to courtly anthologies of prose and verse. Even investigating medieval song in its written forms, then, requires expertise from a wide spectrum of scholars in languages and literature, music, history and art history. Going beyond the written sources to the original performance traditions and sound-worlds of medieval song involves further specialist attempts to bring them to life from various kinds of descriptive and pictorial evidence.\nThis project aims to bring together researchers who often work in isolation, to pool knowledge and share ideas, and to generate new research initiatives that will enable research in medieval song to be carried out in richer, more efficient, interdisciplinary collaborations. Communication between members will be carried out through an email discussion list, through newsletters and postings on the group's website, and through three events which will enable face-to-face contact. The first two events will be scholarly workshops, spaced a year apart, to generate proposals for specific research projects and to develop them further with the unique benefits of wide consultation across the group. The third event will be performance-based, in which specialist performers of early music will build on the research in progress to present a programme of medieval song to a public audience. Feedback from the performers and audience will lead to further discussions in the ongoing communications of the Network.\nThe project will focus initially on medieval song in England, which raises a number of specific problems that the group will be well placed to address. Most importantly, medieval England was a tri-lingual society, and songs were written in Latin, French and English. Manuscripts regularly contain songs in all three languages, and numerous translations of songs between languages were also made. Much earlier work on songs has been divided up along linguistic lines, creating artificial divisions between the experiences of medieval audiences and readers. The Network will facilitate the sharing of literary expertise in different languages that is necessary to understand this significant literary-musical culture. Numerous connections between England and the Continent in the domain of song can also be traced though, and the Network aims to go on to explore these connections further, marshalling its uniquely comprehensive body of expertise to make possible cross-disciplinary, international collaboration that has never before been attempted. \n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond the academic constituency, this research is of direct benefit to the following groups:\n\nspecialist performers of early music\nconcert and festival organisers and promoters\nmuseums, libraries, and galleries\nthe wider public\n\nMembers of the first and third groups identified here already form part of the Medieval Song Network. From its outset, there has been interest in the Network from performing musicians, whose access to repertoire and the latest research on it will be greatly enhanced through the personal and virtual contacts fostered by the Network; these benefits will in turn feed into the performers' future programming choices for concerts, festival performances, and recordings, and in these ways impact upon the concert-going and record-buying public. The performance of medieval song has often been hampered by the range of expertise needed to understand this music and its context; the performers and promoters accessing the research of the Network will help to bring to life a significant aspect of our shared cultural heritage that has only rarely been available to audiences in the past. Our membership includes certain individuals who have the rare capacity to work across academic and professional performance fields, such as Christopher Page and John Potter. We aim to follow their lead and also help promote the teaching of medieval performance techniques in UK conservatoires.\n\nConsiderable interest in the Network has also been shown by many library and archive professionals, particularly those involved with enhancing access to their resources through digital innovations. Members of the public can access digital images, along with descriptions and studies, of medieval sources through library and other websites: the Network's web portal will provide an easy, one-stop access point to the many different resources available, thus enabling users to encounter - in visual form - these documents of musical and literary history. In due course, access to the Network will be of benefit to museum and library curators planning exhibitions of their sources of medieval song, many of which have rarely if ever been on show in public. Since the Network's activities will be focussed in the first instance on medieval song in the British Isles, its impact will be felt most directly in the UK cultural and heritage sector.\n\nIt is likely that performers, promoters, and museum and library professionals will learn of the activities of the Network gradually during the funded period. Word of mouth will be significant in reaching these parties, and the large number and wide geographical dispersal of participants in the Network will ensure many contacts by this means. The Network's website, hosted through the Institute of Musical Research, will also be accessed by many from outside the academic sector: the IMR website has already established itself as an important source of information about musical activities in London and elsewhere in the UK, and the IMR's events are often attended by music professionals and members of the public. \n\nFurther impact on the public, through performers, promoters and museum and library professionals, will be realised in the longer term, as the benefits of the Network and its expertise are disseminated through concerts, festivals, recordings, online and traditional exhibitions. The final event of the Network's funded period will be based around performance, and every effort will be made through the IMR's and other publicity networks to reach as many potential audiences as possible. UCL's Youtube and itunes channels are further ways of sharing the concert with a wider public. This performance event will, we hope, stimulate interest in medieval song beyond academic horizons, and encourage performers and audiences to venture into the new territories opened up by this rich soundscape. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36840</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I000232/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>950E3601-19AF-48B8-9030-FB18B0E0FB1A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medieval Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>120E89AC-386D-4E25-9417-A3FE4D6FE83A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
