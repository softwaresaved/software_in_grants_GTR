We place language training at the heart of our activities and actively develop the research agenda, focusing on key themes in these countries. By doing so, we put the UK in a leading position to engage with this important region. Our training of postgraduate students and young researchers to become specialists in the field of Russian, Central and East European Studies and our engagement with the academic and public policy agendas are crucial for the well-being of the United Kingdom. Many other European countries have held a competitive edge in this area for some time. 
The expansion of the European Union (EU), the impact of the current economic crisis, issues of security, welfare, migration, minority rights and developments in culture and society are key themes for CRCEES. We are well aware of issues surrounding migration as it impacts on this country, but why does this take place? What is going on in our chosen area which results in the flow of different peoples to this country and what are the implications of this? What is happening to the European Union? What are the economic and social implications of the current crisis and where does the EU go from here? Will there be further expansion, for example, to include Turkey? What is happening to our 'near neighbours' in Ukraine and Russia and in the former soviet space, particularly in Central Asia and the Caucasus? Why is nationalism on the rise and what does this mean for the stability of the region? We have seen the Greek crisis but there are many countries in our selected area of research which are equally vulnerable. In an increasingly competitive world we need to know more about these societies and cultures. 
We have long history of cultural engagement and have worked with various embassies and funding bodies in the promotion of public events, which is something we aim to continue in the next phase of the Centre. Awareness and understanding of different cultures is an important part of our work. Cultural discourse and interaction will continue to form a crucial theme for us and we have made links with many local migrant communities as well as public bodies and NGOs in furthering this agenda. We have been engaged actively in the development of new research and cultural agendas, such as exploring the ways in which Russian and East European cultures are translated and perceived across disciplinary, linguistic and academic-end user boundaries. 
In the first phase of funding for Language Based Area Studies, the Centre for Russian, Central and East European Studies and the other Centres have developed an international brand which has succeeded in producing a new cohort of specialists. These young graduates, who are now working in academia, public policy, the business community and in the NGO sector, are making a positive contribution not only in terms of the issues outlined above, but in making the UK a more competitive force in this vital region. These new specialists together with those already in academic life possess a solid grasp of the various languages of the region, which increases their ability to make a real impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We see the impact of our activities taking direct forms. We have strong national and international advisory boards, which contain figures not only from leading academic institutions, but from business, public policy, NGOs and cultural organisations. Our central aim is the training and development of specialists who can use their research skills and knowledge in a variety of ways. Thus our graduates find themselves working in the business, public policy and cultural spheres, and thereby contribute to the development of UK competitiveness. Our academic agenda focused as it is on issues of security, economic and social development, health, migration, minority rights, the environment, and developments in the cultural sphere have a direct relevance and feed into academic and public discourse.

It is our belief that CRCEES and the other LBAS Centres have created a dynamic research and training environment which impacts beyond both in and beyond academic life. Concrete examples are set out in the case for support, but here it is worth noting a few: Professor Smith's work on minority rights has had an impact on national discourse on this topic in Romania and Armenia and in the Council of Europe, and was noted as an example of excellence by the AHRC. GRAMnet ,The Glasgow Refugee Migration and Asylum network has worked closely with local and national government and the NGO sector on this issue, and members from these communities take part in its steering group. This has also fed into our ESRC Festival of Social Science, which for the third year in a row has worked with local schools with a large migrant community. We focus on their experience and how they interact with more settled communities and we also examine how the latter interacts with the former. Thus, at the individual and family level we feel that we have made and continue to make a real impact. These are on-going efforts with a strong public policy focus. This also has an impact on public services in that one of our tasks in working with policy makers is to examine immigration flows and the resources implications related to this issue In the creative arts we are continuing to develop a strong profile. We feel that this is one of our strongest areas and even a cursory glance at our website will indicate the scale of our involvement- from film, literature, poetry, music and cultural awareness events, which are supported by various governments in our area are open to the public. This has an academic side in that AHRC funded projects on cultural exchange and the development of the cultural space involving artists and diverse communities are on- going. Our Translating Russian and East European Cultures research group which is AHRC funded is central to these events. 
In the cultural sphere CRCEES works closely with the Scotland-Russia Business Forum, which has links with local councils in Glasgow and Edinburgh with the national government and includes UK wide practitioners, including businesses and the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce. It is also supported by the British Embassy in Moscow. These activities are supported by reference to our key research themes each of which has a strong public policy profile. In order to facilitate the continuation of these links between the various bodies we include representatives of non-academic organisations in the management of CRCEES and in each of its research strands, and in the development of research themes, a factor which increases the level of impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder
