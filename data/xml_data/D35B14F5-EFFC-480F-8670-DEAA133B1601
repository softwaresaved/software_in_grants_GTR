Primordial follicles consist of an egg (oocyte) surrounded by a layer of pre-granulosa cells, which support, maintain and control the growth of the oocyte. Women are born with a finite number of follicles which decline in number throughout life, and no new follicles are formed after birth. The menopause occurs when the follicular reserve is exhausted, which normally happens around the age of 50. However, in 1% of women the menopause occurs before the age of 40, a condition known as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). In addition to being a devastating diagnosis for women yet to complete their families, POI is associated with significant post-menopausal health risks, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, as societal trends move increasingly towards starting families later in life, and the supply and quality of oocytes in the ovary declines with age, the number of women experiencing sub-fertility is likely to rise. Despite the critical importance of the follicle formation process in establishing reproductive lifespan in humans, and other mammals (such as livestock species), we know very little about how the stock of follicles is formed in the fetal ovary. Improving our knowledge of this fundamental process is essential if we are to investigate how genetic, environmental or lifestyle factors can disrupt follicle formation and curtail reproductive lifespan. The cell to cell signalling molecule Activin A (ActA) is a possible key regulator of follicle formation. Elevated ActA signalling in fetal/neonatal mouse ovaries results in the formation of greater numbers of primordial follicles. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, but is likely to involve changes to pre-granulosa cell number or behavior, as ActA only signals to this cell type in the developing ovary. Pre-granulosa cells also express a protein called FoxL2, which activates genes important for ovarian development. In humans, mutations in the FOXL2 gene cause POI, infertility and granulosa cell tumours (a rare type of ovarian cancer). In mice, pre-granulosa cells that lack FoxL2 cannot function correctly, and so fail to form follicles (or form follicles that cannot mature). In the pituitary gland, ActA and FoxL2 work together to activate genes that are required for cells to respond to, and produce, reproductive hormones, and a similar FoxL2/ActA interaction activates genes in the granulosa cells of the adult ovary. Whether ActA and FoxL2 work together to regulate pre-granulosa cell function and follicle formation in the fetal ovary is not known, however. The aim of this project is to address this question, using the neonatal mouse ovary and human pre-granulosa cells as models. We will establish whether the number of FoxL2-expressing pre-granulosa cells formed in the ovary limits the number of follicles that can be formed, and determine whether activin increases follicle number by altering the size of the pre-granulosa cell pool. To gain insight into the biochemical processes they regulate in pre-granulosa cells, we will identify the genes that ActA and FoxL2 jointly-control, and investigate whether loss of either factor prevents these genes from being switched on or off correctly. Finally, we will investigate why primordial follicles fail to form correctly in FoxL2-deficient mouse ovaries, determine whether aberrant signalling by activin (or other signals) is the cause of this defect, and establish whether this can be corrected by restoring normal levels of signalling between cells. These studies will shed new light on how the number of follicles (and thus female reproductive lifespan) is established, provide insight into how mutations in FOXL2 in humans lead to infertility, and inform future studies to develop of new strategies to manage fertility.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Female reproductive lifespan is dependent on the assembly of cohort of primordial follicles during fetal life, which contain an oocyte and supporting somatic pregranulosa cells. As no new oocytes are formed after birth, disruption of follicle formation could lead to reduced fertility in adulthood. Little is known about how follicle formation is regulated at the molecular level. The growth factor activin A (ActA), and pregranulosa cell-specific transcription factor Foxl2, are key regulators of follicle formation: elevated ActA signalling leads to more follicles being formed in neonatal mouse ovaries, and follicle formation is impaired in Foxl2-deficient mice. In the pituitary, ActA and Foxl2 co-regulate expression of the same genes, and loss of either factor inhibits gene expression. Whether ActA and Foxl2 interact in pre-granulosa cells to control follicle formation is unknown, therefore this project aims to test the hypothesis that ActA and Foxl2 co-ordinately regulate follicle formation. In support of this, we have identified novel gene targets of ActA in the fetal ovary, which are also known to be regulated by FoxL2. We will determine whether pregranulosa cell numbers limit the number of follicles formed, and establish whether ActA increases follicle number by increasing pregranulosa cell numbers. Using microarrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation we will identify the genes regulated by ActA and FOXL2 in pregranulosa cells, and inhibit their function (using siRNA or small molecule inhibitors) to determine whether both are required for expression of target genes. Finally, we will determine whether dysregulated ActA signalling underpins the defect in follicle formation in Foxl2-deficient mice, and investigate whether this defect can be rescued by inhibiting ActA signalling in vitro. These studies will elucidate how primordial follicle formation in the mammalian ovary is regulated, and provide a framework to study how disruption of this process can impair fertility</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our work seeks to extend current knowledge of how female reproductive lifespan is established, by investigating how the signalling molecule activin A, and the transcription factor FOXL2, interact to regulate the process of follicle formation during fetal life, which in turn is a key determinant of female reproductive lifespan. The immediate beneficiaries of this research will be (1) the academic community (see academic beneficiaries) and (2) the applicant, postdoctoral research associate and students working on the project. These will benefit in the short term through employment, and the acquisition of project-specific and generic research skills which are in academic and commercial demand. Project staff and students will attend relevant training to improve transferable skills such as time management, presentations and staff supervision, and the Investigator will receive formal training on media engagement to maximize dissemination of project findings. This will contribute to a more skilled and productive UK workforce and thus enhance UK economic competitiveness. (3) Clinicians and allied health professionals working in the field of reproductive medicine; these will benefit in the short term through improved knowledge of how the ovarian reserve is established and maintained, and how disruptions of these processes contribute to subfertility, which in turn can be communicated to patients to promote improvements in reproductive health. In the long term, our work may inform the development of new strategies to manage/extend the ovarian reserve, which are needed as people increasingly defer starting families until later in life (when female fertility declines due to reduced quality/number of eggs). Female reproductive health problems are a significant public health burden: ~15% of couples experience difficulty in conceiving, and 1% of women experience premature menopause before the age of 40. These conditions negatively impact on quality of life, well-being and economic productivity, thus development of new treatments could improve the health, wealth and well-being of the population, and reduce demand on health services. Mutations in FOXL2 cause ~5% of ovarian cancers, thus reproductive oncologists may also benefit in the short term from improved insight into the etiology of this condition, leading to improved diagnosis/management strategies over the longer term. (4) animal production industry: short term improvements in the performance of this industry are not anticipated to arise from this work, although increasing awareness of optimum maternal health during breeding may improve productivity. Subfertility is a major problem in the UK livestock industry, leading to economic losses through wastage/culling of unproductive animals and repeated servicing by artificial insemination. As with (3) above, knowledge arising from this work may contribute to the development of new strategies for the management of livestock fertility, which may enhance productivity, improve animal welfare, and contribute to UK economic competitiveness. (5) The general public will benefit over the short term through increased awareness of how female fertility is established, and of reproductive health issues more broadly. Increasing awareness of reproductive health matters will promote behavioural changes in society that will mitigate the negative impacts of lifestyle activities (such as smoking) on the fertility of the next generation. Over the longer term, public benefit may be derived through development of novel means to measure follicle reserves, and manage subfertility (as in 3 above) enabling informed choices to be made when family planning, and improving the general health and productivity of a significant fraction of the UK workforce. By disseminating our findings in schools, students may be encouraged into careers in science and technology, thus contributing to a more skilled workforce and enhancing UK economic competitiveness over the long term.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>359772</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P003435/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9898EFC8-73AB-4E1E-A207-04A486D9F1A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal developmental biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1FD58B66-FDA8-4816-8F65-1B43122272E2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal reproduction</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
