The anatomy of a nematode is very simple - they only possess longitudinal muscles in their body wall and their nervous system comprises of ~300 nerve cells that are arranged in a similar pattern in species across the phylum. Despite this, they are complex, diverse and highly specialised animals. Indeed, one reason for their success is the diversity in their behaviour and their ability to survive in many different habitats throughout the world as both free-living and parasitic species. Nematodes can be divided into different clades based on their relatedness - the current train of thought is that there are five major clades (I-V). As parasites of livestock, nematodes can significantly impact the health and well-being of agricultural animals, thereby directly affecting productivity, economic return and animal welfare. For example, Haemonchus contortus is the most pathogenic nematode of sheep, leading to severe anaemia and sometimes death. As parasites of plants, nematodes can cause total destruction of plant material, and are a significant problem in many commercially important crops such as potato and tomato, amongst others. A key issue in the control of nematode parasites is that the drugs that are currently used to treat them are becoming less effective as the worms develop resistance. In fact, in some areas of the world (for example, parts of Scotland and New Zealand), sheep and cattle cannot be farmed simply because of parasite control problems. Therefore we need to search for novel drug targets so that livestock farming has a future both in the UK and further afield. In order to ensure survival a nematode must move, feed, and reproduce. Each of these behaviours rely on muscle, and are under the control of signalling molecules within the nervous system of the nematode. Unlike structure, the chemical make-up of the nematode nervous system is complex. One group of signalling molecules are the neuropeptides. In nematodes there are three main families of neuropeptides, the largest of which are known as the FMRFamide-like peptides or FLPs. FLPs have been shown to modulate feeding, reproduction and movement in many nematode species and therefore, the FLP signalling system is a potential novel drug target candidate. There are &amp;gt;70 FLPs in nematodes, and the same structures have been shown to be present in free-living and parasitic species. We don't know if these structures play similar roles in different nematode species. This information is important in order to select the 'best' candidates for drug targetting. For example, if an individual FLP was critical to the survival of one animal-parasite but not to another, then it would be a less attractive target than one that played an important role in several important nematode parasites. We have some preliminary evidence which points to functional differences in FLPs across the nematode phylum. This study plans to investigate the role of individual FLPs in nematodes by examining their distribution in the nervous system of a range of nematode species representing different clades and lifestyles and probing the effects of the FLPs on muscle-based behaviours. This research will increase our understanding of the FLP signalling system in nematodes, and comparative analyses will provide baseline data on the utility of FLP signalling as a target system for parasite control.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Parasitic nematodes impose a major economic and welfare burden on livestock, with global economic losses associated with animal death, reduced growth and productivity, in addition to the costs associated with anthelmintic treatment. Unfortunately, the current spectrum of drugs used to treat nematode parasites of livestock are compromised by resistance, compounding the economic impact. The nematode neuromuscular system has proved to be a rich source of drug targets, as it is responsible for governing many aspects of nematode behaviour that ensure survival. Indeed, most of the current broad spectrum anthelmintics target the classical transmitter component of this system, and yet the neuropeptidergic system is as important to the normal behaviour of the nematode parasite. Significantly, this system will not be burdened by resistance. A major hurdle to exploitation of the neuropeptidergic system is the lack of functional validation of neuropeptides and their receptors in key parasite species. In this study we will employ multiple techniques to investigate the function of the largest family of nematode neuropeptides, the FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs), and its conservation throughout phylum Nematoda. We will combine recent technical advances in neuropeptidomics and quantitative PCR with classical localization methodologies (ICC, ISH) to probe FLP and FLP receptor expression in a range of nematode species. In addition, we will use reverse genetics (RNA interference, deletion mutants), and a mixture of simple bioassays with computational behavioural platforms to investigate FLP and FLP receptor function. This will provide us with information on whether or not FLPs and their receptors are functionally conserved in different nematode species from divergent habitats or clades, and it will allow us to identify those receptors to which novel therapeutics can be directed.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Parasitic helminths are a major threat to global food security, and have been estimated to cost the livestock industry worldwide more than $50 billion/annum. The treat-all application approach of broad-spectrum anthelmintics has been the primary method to control parasitic worms in livestock in the developed world for over 50 years, and has made the production of cheap and plentiful food to a growing world population feasible. New control strategies are urgently needed as anthelmintic resistance in nematode parasite populations is spreading globally, and this coupled to the restricted portfolio of new anthelmintics, means that in some parts of the world intensive livestock farming is not sustainable in the absence of new parasite control measures. The programme of research outlined in this proposal, through the discovery and validation of novel drug targets, will help inform industry, government and funding bodies about the potential of developing a more effective control strategy for parasitic worm diseases of livestock. The non-academic beneficiaries of this proposal will range from worldwide farming communities, who would benefit directly from the development of a novel chemotherapeutic for parasite control, to a range of pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries that will have the opportunity to further develop and/or commercialize new validated targets. The applicant (Mousley) has established connections with the Animal Health Industry via current and past research contracts and collaborations (Merial, Pfizer and Jansen Animal Health). Her contacts in these organisations would be in a position to advise on exploitation of the research findings. With respect to the reduction of anthelmintic use, the general public also demand safe, chemical residue reduced food, produced cost effectively from animals maintained in a welfare friendly environment, and therefore would benefit from a novel drug that required fewer applications. In addition, Levy bodies (including the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board) and government will benefit from this applied research, which has the potential to shape future policy and strategy. The impact benefits of this programme will be revealed via website, media, public awareness events such as Science Weeks, Agricultural Shows and conferences. The UK applicant has experience in engaging the farming community through publications in Farming Journals and attendance at Agricultural shows. Public communication of our research in the UK will also be via stands, generic talks by research staff and academic staff at UCAS visits and Open Days to prospective students and parents in respective departments of the applicants. The integrated design of the programme and the questions being addressed should facilitate generation of at least one major headline publication with further impact capabilities. Publications from the research will be co-ordinated by Press and Public Relations Departments at QUB. In addition, the EU- and USA-based collaborators will further enhance international dissemination of the research findings worldwide.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>405069</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Cover image for Volume 46, Issue 10 of International Journal for Parasitology - adult Ascaris suum.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BB6C5034-1938-41C1-8D7D-30F09BFA205A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>International journal readership.

We have maintained a long-standing interest in helminth neurobiology at Queen's University Belfast that stemmed from the early work of Professor D.W. Halton, and continued through research activity in the Maule and Marks laboratories. In the early days, localisation of neuropeptides through immunocytochemical techniques in association with classical biochemical characterisation methods, PCR-based gene detection tools, and muscle-based functional assay systems 
provided data on the importance of neuropeptides to helminth biology, and flagged the candidature of the neuropeptidergic system as an anthelmintic target. Despite this, our understanding of the biology of neuropeptides and their signalling systems, especially in key therapeutically relevant pathogens, is limited. The recent growth in genomic and transcriptomic datasets for parasitic helminths, and positive shift in the cost and accessibility of gene sequencing technologies, provides a welcome gateway to the identification of neuropeptides, their receptors and pathway components. In addition, progress in the development of parasite-focused reverse genetics tools offers the ability to manipulate target function in key pathogens and opportunities for novel anthelmintic discovery. This presentation will provide an overview of the efforts to progress the identification and validation of neuropeptidergic system-derived drug target candidates in nematode parasites, and highlight recent advances in our understanding of neuropeptide biology across the phylum Nematoda.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster Presentation; BSP Spring Meeting 2012, Strathclyde, 3-5 April 2012; RNA interference in Adult Ascaris suum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A475D6F1-B933-4E6A-893B-FA104E620E16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>RNA interference (RNAi) is a reverse genetics technique that represents a valuable method of elucidating gene function. In parasitic nematodes, the efficiency of RNAi varies between species and lifestage. Recent successes in invoking RNAi responses in the larval stages of Ascaris suum provides an opportunity to validate potential drug target candidates and to further probe the biology of Ascaris. This poster reports efforts to establish an RNAi platform in adult A. suum. The approach employed includes the examination of four target gene transcripts whose selection was based on: (i) transcript abundance, (ii) expression and localization patterns, and iii) previous success as RNAi targets in animal and human parasitic nematode gene silencing experiments. dsRNAs were injected into the pseudocoelomic cavity of adult A. suum and changes in transcript levels post-RNAi were assessed using quantitative real time PCR. Specific, potent and statistically significant transcript knockdown (&amp;gt;70%, n_4) was induced in two of the four genes targeted; elongation factor (As-eft-1) and pyrophosphatase (As-ppase). This data demonstrates, for the first time, that adult A. suum possesses a functional RNAi pathway and that a simple injection method of dsRNA delivery was sufficient to trigger an RNAi response. These results highlight the potential for the development of a robust platform for the investigation of gene function in A. suum.

Current control strategies for nematode parasites of agricultural importance are limited to a small cohort of drugs upon which farming has become reliant. However, as anthelmintic resistance develops and residue concerns emerge, the need to develop novel control strategies intensifies with particular emphasis on target spectrum. Nematode parasite FMRFamide-like peptide (FLP) signalling is an attractive target system for novel control options as FLPs are structurally conserved between species irrespective of lifestyle. However, the broad-spectrum utility of drugs directed against FLP signalling targets can only be determined by comparative functional analyses in multiple, divergent pathogenic species. Here we use a range of analysis tools to investigate the utility of the FLP signalling system for nematode parasite control. We report the differential expression patterns of some of the most highly conserved flp-genes (flp-11 and 13) in nematode species including the plant parasitic nematode Globodera pallida. RNA interference of flp-11 and a putative flp-11 receptor in G. pallida provides validation of target potential. Results provide data on the utility of FLP signalling as a source for broad-spectrum parasite control targets.

The neuropeptide signalling system is an attractive resource in the search for novel chemotherapeutic control targets, as it modulates sensory and motor functions. The FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) form one of the largest families of neuropeptides, and are structurally conserved across nematode species, generating potential for a broad-spectrum drug target within the FLPergic system. flp-11 (RNxLVRFamide) is a commonly expressed FLP, encoding at least one, but up to three distinct peptides, in as many as 12 nematode species across Clades III, IV and V. This study investigates the role of flp-11 in G. pallida using a range of techniques to show that (i) Gp-flp-11 encodes a single peptide - AMRNALVRFamide, (ii) Gp-flp-11 is expressed in the nervous system, (iii) worm movement is increased in Gp-flp-11 silenced worms, (iv) the ability of Gp-flp-11 silenced worms to infect potato plants is enhanced, (v) a novel Gp-flp-11 receptor (Gp-flp-11 R) is expressed in G. pallida, and (vi) Gp-flp-11 R silenced worms also display increased movement. This work indicates that Gp-flp-11 and Gp-flp-11 R interact, and play a neuromodulatory role in G. pallida.

The recent growth in genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic datasets for parasitic nematodes provides a welcome gateway to the identification of putative drug targets, vaccine candidates, and diagnostic biomarkers. Indeed, omics-directed approaches to drug target identification have become widely adopted drug-finding strategies for human therapeutics, and have begun in earnest for nematode parasites where a cohort of 'druggable' targets, believed to have chemotherapeutic appeal due to their predicted 'essentiality', have been identified and prioritized in key nematode pathogens including Haemonchus contortus, Ascaris suum and Brugia malayi through in silico analyses. Despite this, a key hurdle to the exploitation of putative targets is the absence of validation tools that allow the manipulation of target function in therapeutically-relevant pathogens. Reverse genetics tools have advanced to the stage where sophisticated methods of transgenesis, gene silencing (RNA interference), and genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9 technology) are established experimental tools that are being applied to probe the biology of many organisms. Their application to nematode parasites has been eagerly awaited; however translation of these technologies has either been difficult or is in early stages of development, such that their potential to novel drug discovery in the parasitology discipline is yet to be realised. This presentation provides an overview of the genetic manipulation tools that are currently available for use in parasitic nematodes, and evaluates the advantages and limitations of these tools to the discovery of novel control targets.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>WAAVP conference (Liverpool UK 16-20 August 2015; Ascaris suum: A Novel Functional Genomics Platform for Nematode Parasites with Potential for Organism-, Tissue- and Cell-level Drug Target Validation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>52203BAD-9290-4810-A817-F6C099F266C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Abstract:</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop/Training Course: Next Generation Sequencing Course, Manchester, April 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>01E4F91A-B950-44AA-8544-6A33A8228FE0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Next Generation Sequencing Course</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral Presentation: BSP Spring Meeting 2011, Nottingham, Uk, 12-14 April 2011; Comparative analyses of FMRFamide-like peptide expression and function in nematodes.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E6CE622C-DCCE-4E7B-9BD6-DC2E67D7D326</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nematode FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) are structurally conserved between species irrespective of clade or lifestyle. However, through the use of immunocytochemistry (ICC), in situ hybridisation (ISH), mass spectrometry, and reporter flp-gene constructs, published datasets have provided preliminary information on inter-species flp-gene- and FLP-expression and highlight hyper-variability between the localisation patterns of homologous FLP sequences. We believe that this FLP variation represents what could be genuine functional differences that ultimately contribute to nematode behavioural adaptability and their success as a phylum. In this study we employ ICC and ISH to investigate the differential expression patterns of two of the most highly conserved flp-genes (flp-11 and flp-13) in a range of nematode species including the clade IV plant parasitic nematodes, Globodera pallida and Meloidogyne incognita, and the clade V free-living nematode, Panagrellus redivivus. In addition RNA interference (RNAi) of flp-11 and flp-13 in G. pallida and M. incognita provides information on the function of these peptides as determined by motility- and chemosensory-based post-gene silencing bioassays. Preliminary results highlight both differences and similarities in flp-11 and flp-13 expression patterns and function between different nematode species. This research provides baseline data on the utility of FLP signalling as a target system for broad-spectrum nematode parasite control.

Effective treatment options for livestock parasites are limited to chemotherapeutics that are subject to resistance pressures. As a result, future sustained control is dependent on the development of vaccines and/or drugs with novel modes of action. This relies on the establishment of drug discovery platforms in key parasites that facilitate drug target identification and validation. RNA interference (RNAi) is an appealing target discovery tool but its utility to the validation of drug targets in nematode parasites is limited because of their variable sensitivity to the available methodologies. Potential reasons for this relate to the inability to achieve optimized conditions that facilitate parasite culture / maintenance in vitro for prolonged periods of time, and appropriate trigger delivery methods. Ascaris suum, a nematode parasite of pigs, is an important veterinary-parasite model and a zoonotic pathogen. Successful RNAi has been reported in L3 larval stage A. suum and we have demonstrated its utility in adult A. suum. Here we report the optimization of an RNAi platform for adult A. suum that includes: (i) identification of the biotic and abiotic factors influencing adult A. suum vigour during in vitro maintenance; (ii) identification of robust methods for RNAi trigger delivery; (iii) approaches to the elucidation of RNAi-associated phenotypes. The optimization of an RNAi platform in adult A. suum has significant appeal in providing a route to target validation for parasitic nematodes.

The efficiency of RNAi in nematodes varies between species, life-stage, and gene target. The large size of Ascaris suum has facilitated its development as a key model species for nematode parasite biochemistry, neurobiology and physiology research, driving discovery biology and comparative studies with the free-living model Caenorhabditis elegans. Whilst RNAi has been reported in L3 larval stage A. suum, it has not been demonstrated in adults, limiting the utility of this gene silencing tool. Here we report the development of an RNAi platform for adult A. suum. Double stranded (ds)RNAs targeting genes expressed in a variety of tissue types (nerve, muscle, all cell types) were injected into the pseudocoelomic cavity of adult female A. suum; successful induction of RNAi was determined by monitoring target-gene transcript levels, encoded protein expression and worm phenotype. The data presented demonstrate: (i) a functional RNAi pathway in adult A. suum that can be triggered by the injection of dsRNA into the pseudocoel; (ii) the RNAi-susceptibility of target genes with disparate expression patterns (expressed in nerves, in muscles or ubiquitously); and, (iii) the ability to induce RNAi in tissues remote from the site of dsRNA injection. The optimisation of an RNAi platform in adult A. suum has significant appeal due to its tractability as a model for experimentation, the availability of genomic/transcriptomic resources and its negative impacts on food security and human health.

Most front-line anthelmintics disrupt parasite behavior through the dysregulation of classical signaling processes and encourage further interrogation of neuromuscular function for new targets. FMRFamide-like peptide (FLPs) signaling systems are core to nematode neuromuscular function and remain unexploited for parasite control. Some of our discovery efforts associated with nematode FLP/FLP receptor biology have uncovered subtle complexities that could compromise target selection in the absence of basic biology data - we present one example of this here. flp-11 is reported to be the most widely expressed flp in Caenorhabditis elegans and shows pan-phylum occurrence, promoting the appeal of the FLP-11 receptor as a putative drug target. A second gene (flp-32) encodes the homologous FLP AMRNALVRFamide, leading us to compare and contrast flp-11 and -32 biology. We found that: (i) flp-11 is not the most widely expressed flp in C. elegans; (ii) flp-11 displays a conserved and restricted expression pattern across nematode clades and lifestyles; (iii) multiple nematodes express both flp-11 and flp-32; (iv) flp-32 displays a broader and less conserved expression pattern in nematodes. Based on C. elegans data, the FLP-11 receptor had appeared to be an appealing target. However, the work here indicates that relying on C. elegans to inform target selection in parasites could lead to erroneous target prioritization. Even for highly conserved neuronal genes, biological data to support drug target value should be derived from parasitic nematodes

Unfortunately, the current spectrum of drugs used to treat helminth parasites are compromised by resistance, such that new control strategies are urgently needed. The helminth neuromuscular system is important in controlling a range of behaviours that are critical to worm survival and therefore represents a potential source of novel drug targets. Whilst parasite neuromusclulature is a proven drug target, most of the drugs that target this system act via the classical signalling pathways, leaving the neuropeptidergic component as an untapped resource. The recent surge in genomic and transcriptomic datasets for helminth parasites has facilitated the identification of candidate drug targets in distinct components of the neuropeptidergic signalling pathway including (i) enzymes involved in generation of active peptides (ii) receptors and (iii) enzymes responsible for peptide degradation. A major hurdle to the validation of these drug target candidates is the lack of functional information on the importance of the target to the survival or success of the parasite. Bioimaging is a central tool in the validation process. It offers a method with which potential drug targets can be localized providing information on their expression in therapeutically-relevant organ systems (e.g. reproductive system, digestive system) and consequently clues on function, and is a robust platform for the validation of reverse genetics (RNA interference) experiments.

Potential Economic Impact:
Research data generated through BB/H019472/1 have facilitated additional research funding through a BBSRC IP Award (BB/MO10392/1) with Merial Animal Health as the industrial partner. This will allow the researchers / pharma company to pursue targets identified through BB/H019472/1 (and other novel targets) as potential control candidates which will aid the further development and commercialization of new validated drug targets and the distribution of novel veterinary pharmaceutical products in the future. The direct link with a pharmaceutical company will potentially progress this project towards achieving economic impact in the future. 

Potential Societal Impact:
Farming communities: in the context of the additional funding stream described above, the farming community will benefit from research outcomes in the form of the development of more effective control strategies for parasitic nematodes of veterinary and economic importance. This will have direct economic impacts on animal health and farmer returns. 

Farmers have also already benefitted in the form of community outreach activities where research data has been, and will continue to be, communicated through attendance and participated in local agricultural events (e.g. presentation at NI Pig Event, attendance at local Agricultural Show, interaction with farmers). This has helped the farmer to have a greater understanding of the impact of nematode parasites on animal health and appreciate the importance of scientific research.

Educators and Students: the research outcomes from BB/H019472/1 have already had a direct impact in the educational sector through the engagement with primary school students (via Primary Life Sciences Scheme) and secondary level students and their teachers (careers events, work placements, school visits). In addition, the research linked to BB/H019472/1 has been presented to tertiary level students (undergraduate-, MSc-, PhD-level). In this context, students have learnt about the importance of scientific research in general, in addition to specifics associated with the impact of nematode parasites on agriculture in the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5ADE1B63-C8CB-4790-904E-36539133B200</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>SPECIFIC AIM 1: Examine flp-gene and FLP-receptor gene conservation in nematodes

Summary of progress: flp-gene and FLP-receptor gene conservation in nematodes has been examined using bioinformatics to trawl the genomic and transcriptomic datasets of 17 nematode species representing multiple clades and lifestyles. The data generated represents the most comprehensive insight into the flp and flp-GPCR complements of parasitic nematodes to date and have provided a database of conserved and unique nematode flp and flp-GPCR genes in free-living, animal-, plant- and human-parasitic nematodes. 
A number of key findings have emerged from this work:
? Multiple nematode parasites appear to possess a reduced complement of C. elegans flp-gene 
 sequelogues.
? flp-gene complement appears to broadly map nematode clade division, with some exceptions.
? Some flp-genes are more highly conserved than others.
? Only one flp-gene (flp-31) appears to be parasite-specific.
? Known deorphanised C. elegans FLP-receptors are conserved in parasite species. 
? Phylogenetic analysis reveals a further 13 putative flp-GPCR genes in nematode parasites. 

The objectives outlined in Specific Aim 1 have been met by output #2, #5 and #10, detailed below.

SPECIFIC AIM 2: Compare nematode FLP and FLP receptor temporal and spatial expression patterns

Summary of progress: The expression patterns of multiple FLPs have been examined in key nematode species through the use of immunocytochemistry (ICC - custom raised antisera), and in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques in five key nematode species (Caenorhabditis elegans, Panagrellus redivivus, Globodera pallida, Haemonchus contortus, and Teladorsagia circumcincta). We have generated data on the specific expression of structurally-conserved FLPs, enabling direct comparisons between nematode species representing different clades and lifestyles (free-living, animal-, plant- and human-parasitic nematodes). Work on the expression (ISH) profile of flp-GPCRs is ongoing alongside an examination of tissue specific FLP expression profiles (peptidomics) and flp-GPCR tissue specific expression profiling (qPCR) in the animal parasitic nematode Ascaris suum. The work completed to date has demonstrated:
? Distinct neuronal localisation patterns for FLP-2, 11, 14, 31, and 32 (ICC) in five key nematode species
? Comparative expression patterns for flp-2, 12, 13, 31 (ISH) in the nervous system of G. 
 pallida. 
? Comparative expression patterns of flp-11 and flp-32 across the five key nematode species highlighted above.
? A restricted and conserved pattern of localisation/expression (ICC/ISH) for FLP-11/flp-11 to one distinct neuronal cell body in the 5 key nematode species examined. 
? A less restricted and variable localisation/expression pattern (ICC/ISH) for FLP-32/flp-32 in the 5 key nematode species examined. 

The objectives outlined in Specific Aim 2 have been met by output #3, #4, #5, #9, #10, and #16, and #17 detailed below.

SPECIFIC AIM 3: Investigate motor-modulation by FLPs in distinct nematode species

Summary of progress: We have employed reverse genetics tools (RNA interference, RNAi) and a number of sensitive post-RNAi bioassays to measure nematode behaviour in both the plant parasitic nematode G. pallida and the animal parasitic nematode A. suum. To date we have:
(a) Generated data on the function of a highly conserved flp-gene, flp-32, and a novel putative flp-32 receptor in G. pallida. Key findings demonstrate that:
? The migration rate of G. pallida increases in Gp-flp-32-silenced worms 
? The ability of G. pallida to infect potato plant root systems is enhanced in Gp-flp-32-silenced worms
? A novel putative Gp-flp-32 receptor (Gp-flp-32R) is expressed in G. pallida
? Gp-flp-32R-silenced worms also display an increase in migration rate.
? Gp-flp-32 plays an intrinsic role in the modulation of locomotory behaviour in G. pallida, and 
 putatively interacts with at least one novel G-protein coupled receptor (Gp-flp-32R). 
? These data report the first functional characterisation of a parasitic nematode FLP-GPCR.
(b) Developed (and are currently optimising), a novel and robust RNAi platform in A. suum which will support flp- and flp-GPCR gene functional characterisation. The data show that:
? A.suum RNAi is readily achievable: Injection of dsRNA triggers knockdown of a range of gene
 transcripts (100% percent success rate; &amp;gt;10 gene targets; highly reproducible)
? Multiple tissue types are susceptible: neuronal and muscle based genes are susceptible to RNAi
? RNAi response is capable of spreading: silencing is detected in areas of the worm that are most distant from the site of injection
? Silencing of validated drug targets is achievable (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits)
? Double stranded (ds)RNA cocktail is as efficient as single dsRNA-approach
? Silencing persists for at least 8 days

The objectives outlined in Specific Aim 3 have been met by output #1, #3, #5, #6, #7, #8, #11, #12, #13, and #14 detailed below.

NON ACADEMIC:
? Industry/pharmaceuticals/biotechnology: Research data generated through BB/H019472/1 have contributed to further research funding involving the pharmaceutical industry (BBSRC IP Award BB/MO10392/1 with Merial Animal Health as the industrial partner). This will contribute to further research data which will aid the further development and commercialization of new validated drug targets and the distribution of novel veterinary pharmaceutical products in the future.
? General public/farming communities: will benefit from research outcomes in the form of basic research which will contribute to the development of more effective control strategies for parasitic nematodes of veterinary and economic importance. This will have direct economic impacts on animal health. Farmers have also benefitted in the form of community outreach activities where research data has been, and will continue to be, communicated through attendance and participated in local agricultural events (e.g. presentation at NI Pig Event, attendance at local Agricultural Show, interaction with farmers). This has helped the farmer to have a greater understanding of the impact of nematode parasites on animal health and appreciate the importance of scientific research.
? General public/food and drink industry: will benefit from the research outcomes as a consequence of pharmaceutical interest in the research data generated. If these data contribute to new pharmaceuticals which enhance animal yields this will help meet a growing public demand for cost-effective food production.
? Policy: Going forward government and levy bodies will benefit from the research in the form of enhanced information with which to aid shaping future agricultural strategy and policy. 

ACADEMIC:
? Education: research outcomes have had direct impact in the educational sector in the form of engagement activities with primary (Primary Life Sciences Scheme) and secondary level students (Careers events, Work placements) in addition to tertiary level students (undergraduate, MSc, PhD) who have become aware of the importance of research in our society by communication of the research project and outcomes. In addition the outcomes from this research have facilitated research-led teaching for undergraduate students at QUB.
? Research: the outcomes from this work have been published (with additional publications in progress) and presented at national and international conferences. This has facilitated new collaborations and provided opportunity for a further funding stream to continue the identification and validation of novel chemotherapeutic targets for nematode parasites.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7DDD47E2-B2E0-4BBD-8667-2BC58C18B39A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1638A656-D87E-4CE9-8341-F342CAD0BEA6"><gtr:id>1638A656-D87E-4CE9-8341-F342CAD0BEA6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parasitic nematodes: molecular biology, biochemistry and immunology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9952b932f530a93c5836ef27d84e7d82"><gtr:id>9952b932f530a93c5836ef27d84e7d82</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mousley A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1845937591</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A2801C5F-8E33-49F9-823A-CFD0AC587B1A"><gtr:id>A2801C5F-8E33-49F9-823A-CFD0AC587B1A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unraveling flp-11/flp-32 dichotomy in nematodes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International journal for parasitology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/36f3314676a7ebc5e6ca74d8d3efffd6"><gtr:id>36f3314676a7ebc5e6ca74d8d3efffd6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Atkinson LE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0020-7519</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7320C0E7-8D55-4085-B17E-2593108F4BFF"><gtr:id>7320C0E7-8D55-4085-B17E-2593108F4BFF</gtr:id><gtr:title>An eye on RNAi in nematode parasites.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trends in parasitology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/57ee2373867fbbcdb031d184baf155ec"><gtr:id>57ee2373867fbbcdb031d184baf155ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Maule AG</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-4922</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EBC4F9FC-501E-4C63-ADFD-9523F71FC4FE"><gtr:id>EBC4F9FC-501E-4C63-ADFD-9523F71FC4FE</gtr:id><gtr:title>RNAi effector diversity in nematodes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLoS neglected tropical diseases</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1b8d15c507371f16090a71c703cd3721"><gtr:id>1b8d15c507371f16090a71c703cd3721</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dalzell JJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1935-2727</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6B06E192-320C-42C4-9613-C311529412CD"><gtr:id>6B06E192-320C-42C4-9613-C311529412CD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parasite neuropeptide biology: Seeding rational drug target selection?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International journal for parasitology.
