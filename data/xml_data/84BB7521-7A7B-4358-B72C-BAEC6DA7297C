Recent literature cautions that simplified narratives about illegality in border zones are complicating efforts at addressing social inequities. This research examines social and political dimensions of rural livelihoods along the Zimbabwe-Mozambique border in conjunction with current debates about transboundary resource management in the region, focusing on perspectives in artisanal gold mining communities in Manica, Mozambique, where Zimbabwean artisanal miners live and work side-by-side with Mozambicans. The study explores what displacement means to different rural actors and how challenges are negotiated in pursuing resource-dependent livelihoods, with the ultimate goal of enhancing policies for addressing livelihood insecurity on both sides of the border.

The Zimbabwe-Mozambique border is a high priority for research, as large numbers of Zimbabweans have crossed into Mozambique as Zimbabwe's economic and political crisis deepened and are engaging in artisanal mining. Empirically, the study addresses three interlinked research questions: 1) How does mobility across the border represent new opportunities or, conversely, new challenges, for reconfigured livelihoods in artisanal mining communities near/along the border?; 2) To what extent are global and national institutions taking these challenges and opportunities into consideration in their approach to transboundary resource management policies?; 3) How are formal artisanal miners associations and informal groups of artisanal miners (on both sides of the border) socially engaged in processes of contesting land near/at the border?

Through in-depth life history interviews, focus groups, field diaries, visual methods and participant observation with artisanal mining associations, the study will explore how women and men in mining communities negotiate livelihood struggles, analysing social and economic ties that transcend the border. Analysing perspectives on mining, displacement and migration in relation to transboundary resource governance, policy documents will be reviewed and interviews conducted with national and district government authorities, companies and civil society organizations.

This study will generate original data and contribute new insights to engage conceptual and policy debates as well as associated methodological and ethical debates in borderlands research. The analysis aims to inform researchers in geography, development studies, African studies and the growing field of borderlands research, as well as policymakers. In 2011, the African Union signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the African Borderlands Research Network, based at the University of Edinburgh, highlighting the need for research to support policymaking that enhances livelihoods in border regions. This project is especially timely in light of a global environmental treaty signed by more than 120 countries recently, including Zimbabwe and Mozambique, requiring governments to take new steps to manage artisanal gold mining. Government officials have expressed the need for research to inform National Action Plans for implementing the treaty in the 2015-2020 period.

The project's regional workshops will co-produce knowledge while building local capacity of artisanal mining associations, government agencies, civil society and universities in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and the UK. Theoretical, ethical and methodological insights will be disseminated through books, articles, briefs, lectures and courses, to inform crosscutting debates at the intersection of borderlands research and extractive sector research. Building on past experiences working with United Nations agencies, this project will be transformative in cultivating new skills to lead North-South-South collaborative research that informs policymakers at regional, national and global levels.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit the African Union (AU) in pursuing its goal of &amp;quot;uniting and integrating Africa through peaceful, open and prosperous borders,&amp;quot; specifically assisting the AU Border Programme to promote evidence-based equity-sensitive policies for transboundary resource management.

The research will also benefit UK aid agencies and governments globally, informing debates at United Nations forums related to implementing the new international treaty on mercury signed by &amp;gt;120 countries, which includes special clauses on artisanal mining. Based on my past work, United Nations Environment Program officials invited me to share future research, creating opportunities over the next 10 years for influencing policies on mining and resource management that respect migrant rights and promote sustainable livelihoods. Donors and NGOs interested in promoting the treaty will also benefit from an enhanced understanding of cross-border livelihood issues to help orient their funding, education, training and service efforts. The project will particularly benefit the Southern African Development Community, as artisanal mining in the Zambezi River Basin alone affects 14 countries.

Government ministries (especially mining, environment, economic development and women/ empowerment) in both Mozambique and Zimbabwe will directly benefit from the study through deepened appreciation of the concerns of involved parties (see support letters). Incorporating findings into policy recommendations will further enhance their abilities to implement fair and sustainable policies, including those related to the above-mentioned treaty to which they are accountable over the 2015-2020 period. Both countries are explicitly seeking research to assist them in formulating their strategies.

Small-scale mining associations in both Zimbabwe (ZAMSC -Zimbabwe Artisanal and Small-Scale for Sustainable Development Mining Council) and Mozambique (UNIMA- Union of Mining Associations in Manica) will particularly benefit from this project. The data and more nuanced conceptualizations generated regarding livelihoods and migrant rights in border areas will enhance their abilities to work with diverse local communities, men and women; be they members or nonmembers; licensed or unlicensed; or other parties affected by the economics and social ties generated by borderlands small scale mining. As noted from my previous work (see letters), such research can contribute to valuable direct services (including health, environment, safety and livelihood security) through effective lobbying for improved government services and equitable policies.

Artisanal mining communities in border regions in other African countries will benefit, as the research informs debates on legalization of informal mining, risk mitigation, migrant rights, resettlement challenges and livelihood social and economic supports. With the head of ZAMSC being the president of the Africa-wide federation of artisanal miners, communities not only on both sides of the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border but in other countries as well will benefit from the data and insights generated to improve transboundary resource management, as associations across Africa will incorporate this evidence in their work.

Local governments, local training programmes and NGOs in Manica will benefit from the data, as well as network-building activities, enhancing their effectiveness in promoting social and economic benefits especially for communities in the Chimanimani Highlands. The most direct beneficiaries will ultimately be the migrant Zimbabwean artisanal miners and the communities where they resettled in Manica province. This benefit will be fostered through producing new conceptualisation and new evidence on migration-associated issues - including social, kinship and economic ties as well as challenges faced - that will stimulate new understandings and new approaches to harnessing opportunities and addressing migrant concerns.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>275501</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>I commissioned artwork from a cartoonist in Zimbabwe to develop images related to research themes on small-scale mining, for discussion.

I prepared a talk that included a 1-hour review of my research to date on mining, environmental governance issues and livelihood challenges in Zimbabwe, focusing on challenges that small-scale miners have faced in complying with environmental impact assessment (EIA) policy requirements and alternative proposals for reforming the EIA system - drawing both on experiences in Zimbabwe (over a 10-year period since I initially began doing research in Zimbabwe) and a review of international experiences. I was deeply fortunate that the ZImbabwean Ambassador to Canada attended this event, as did other people who were involved in international development organisations. Following the 1-hour presentation, there was another hour of discussion with audience members, with vibrant discussion involving questions, debate and exchanges on policy ideas. The talk was critically framed around the idea of moving beyond conventionally narrow 'engineering'-oriented solutions that presuppose what community needs are, and adopting a more flexible policy approach that requires the various types of artisanal and small-scale mining, as small-scale miners associations have lobbied for reforms to the Mines and Minerals Act that take into account definitions and guidelines for different types of mining (at the moment, there is a generic policy rather than a policy for different types of small-scale mining). The Ambassador was appreciative of the talk and expressed considerable interest in following up with these ideas further, as did 2 other staff members from the Zimbabwean Embassy who accompanied the Ambassador. Other people in attendance at the event also expressed interest in following up on the talk and included people advising international development organisations as well as people involved in other major international research projects spanning other countries in Africa. This included research teams involved in work in Mozambique, thus providing an especially important connection with my Future Research Leader project. Some of the researchers in attendance in the event subsequently cited my research in their work.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://carleton.ca/npsia/cu-events/14381-2/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Delivered keynote lecture at the 'International Conference on Community Mining in Indonesia: Minimising Harm, Maximising Benefits'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DB4C57C-238D-4E24-951B-F7EBD1A5F1F3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to give a keynote speech on community mining issues in Indonesia, sharing my research on small-scale mining to date.

My speech shared critical insights from research over a ten year period and the audience included a range of people - including policymakers in Indonesia (who are responsible for managing small-scale mining), academics in Indonesia, NGO representatives, and other organisations.

This took place in 2017.
