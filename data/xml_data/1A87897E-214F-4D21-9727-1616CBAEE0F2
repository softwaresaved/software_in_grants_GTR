Not only does it give you more opportunities in education and work, but it may also benefit other skills, such as improving your ability to switch rapidly between two or more task (a skill known as &amp;quot;executive control&amp;quot;). Yet in recent years there has been a marked decline in the number of secondary school pupils taking modern foreign language exams in England.

In July 2012 the Education secretary unveiled plans to introduce modern foreign language teaching in primary schools, from age 7+. One motivation for this change is that research has shown that children are more successful than adults at learning languages in naturalistic environments (e.g., when immersed in a different language as a result of moving to a new country). However, it is not yet known why children are better language learners in this situation. There is also some evidence suggesting that this advantage for younger learners may not hold in the classroom.

We plan to carry out a set of language learning experiments to explore which factors promote successful language learning in two age groups; 11 year olds (the age at which children currently (typically) begin second language learning in school), and 7 year olds (the age at which second language will begin in school if the proposed changes in the national curriculum are implemented). In each experiment, we will compare how well groups of English-speaking children of each age learn some aspect of a new language (either Japanese or Italian). Across the experiments we will see how changes to training materials and procedures (but not the amount of exposure) lead to better/worse learning in each age-group.

One experiment set will examine how details of the specific utterances which the children hear leads to different types of learning. For example, previous work suggests that it is important to hear new language structures with a variety of different words, otherwise they may not be learned and used in a general manner. However increased variety also means increased complexity, and this may particularly hinder younger learners who have lower processing capacity. Our experiments will explore this trade-off and investigate what type of &amp;quot;input structure&amp;quot; leads to better learning in each age group.

The second experiment set will explore how different learning schedules might affect learning. More specifically, we will explore whether information about a new language is consolidated overnight while we sleep. Using these findings we will then carry out studies looking at whether spreading learning out over multiple learning sessions, and thus including more periods of interleaved sleep, is beneficial; this will speak directly to the way in which language classes are scheduled in schools (i.e., is it better to have one long language class per week or lots of short classes spread out over multiple days).

Finally, we will examine whether explicit instruction about the new language is useful. In the previous experiments, children will have been passively exposed to the language, mirroring a more naturalistic learning environment. However there is evidence that explicit instruction is useful for adult language learners, though less is known for children's learning. Our final experiments will add in explicit instruction and see if this aids learning for either 7 or 11 year old learners. For instance, is it useful to explicitly tell children about differences between word order in English (&amp;quot;the girl carries the boy&amp;quot;) and Japanese (&amp;quot;the girl the boy carries&amp;quot;), or is it better to let them find and use these new patterns on their own? We are particularly interested in looking at which type of learning produces the most native-like language competency at the end of the study. It may be that explicit instruction is more effective than no instruction in the early stages of learning, but that no instruction results in more native-like competence by the end of the study.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research and how?

1. Academic beneficiaries will profit from the proposed research program, as described in the &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; section above. 

2. Language teachers will be key beneficiaries; our research will aim to determine the types of language input, learning schedules, and type of instruction that best promote successful language learning in the classroom. These findings will be particularly useful for primary school teachers who will (if the proposed changes to the National Curriculum are implemented in 2014), be tasked with teaching a second language to children who have much smaller processing capacities, and who may learn differently, from children who begin learning a language at 11 years of age.

3. Producers of language learning resources (textbooks, audio courses etc.) are also potential beneficiaries; the findings from our research may be informative with regards to designing materials for introducing new language structures, with a view to tailoring these to the needs of different age groups. 

4. Our research findings may also be relevant to educational policy makers. In particular, data from the proposed experiments exploring whether there is a beneficial effect of interleaving periods of sleep between exposure sessions, will be informative with regards to scheduling of language classes in school (i.e., is it better to have one long language lesson per week, or to have shorter language lessons spread out over multiple days?).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>346350</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Second Language Learning in the Primary Years Teachers Workshop:</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B47A487-E13D-43D8-8BE9-99DB3CD44671</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NOTE - this is a planned event and has not yet occurred (March 30th 2017)

In this grant we are carrying out a set of language learning studies to explore which factors promote successful language learning in two age groups; 11 year olds (the age at which children currently (typically) begin second language learning in school), and 7 year olds (the age at which second language will begin in school if the proposed changes in the national curriculum are implemented). In each study, we compare how well groups of English-speaking children of each age learn some aspect of a new foreign language. Across the studies we will see how changes to training materials and procedures (but not the amount of exposure) lead to better/worse learning in each age-group. A overarching aim is to make links between the literatures in experimental psychology on the role of (i) statistical learning and (ii) sleep associated consolidation in language learning, where experiments have primarily been done with adult learners acquiring artificial languages and English nonce words, to the study of children's second language learning language. The results will further our understanding of the process of language learning at different stages of development, and have potential implications for classroom learning and the development of appropriate teaching materials.

Progress to date: 
We have begun a set of experiments which explore the above questions in the context of English speaking children learning Italian gender and number marking systems. We have developed a computer-based word learning game in which children with no previous knowledge of Italian repeatedly hear Italian definite noun phrases which are marked for gender and number (e.g. il gato -the cat masculine singular, le case the houses, feminine plural). Children play this games over a period of 5 sessions of about 30 minutes (played in their schools on consecutive days) and are also periodically given tests of comprehension and production which probe the extent of their learning and generalization. We are currently collecting data on an experiment which compares 7 year olds and 11 year olds in two learning conditions where we manipulate the number of example nouns they hear for each gender class. Data collection for forty seven year olds is complete (each child tested in five separate sessions over 5 days) and we have conducted preliminary analysis on these data and presented the results at conferences and in invited talks (see outputs below). The results suggest that, in general, children's learning is very item based, with only weak generalization. Contrary to the predictions from some statistical learning experiments, children of this age do not generalize more when they encounter more exemplars for each noun class and in fact they showed greater learning of the number marking system when exemplified with fewer nouns. We interpret this result in terms of greater demands placed on children by more complex input. Interestingly, though generalization is weak, we have evidence that at the item level they are able to use gender information in the determiner to predict upcoming the nouns (i.e. if they hear &amp;quot;il...&amp;quot; they expect a masculine noun). This suggests that children of this age are automatically processing Italian in a predictive fashion, similar to the processing of native speakers. Data collection from 11 year olds is ongoing. Follow up experiments (using the stimuli and methods already developed) probe whether children's learning benefits from manipulations to input structure which allow them to initially learn from more simple input (with complexity gradually introduced) and from the addition of explicit instruction. In addition, we plan experiments which explore whether the automaticity in processing which we observe depends on memory consolidation processes associated with sleep. 

Additional experiments use a similar paradigm to look at aspect of phonetic training. Part of this work was originally developed in collaboration with Dr Anastasia Giannakopolou (University of Bedforshire) and supported by a British Academy small grant and Dr Wonnacott now has PhD students working on projects in this area. The research fills an important gap in the literature since there is a large literature in adult phonetic training but almost none with children. To date we have a full data set from 7-8 year old and adult native Greek speakers learning English (tested in Greece in a ten session training study). Interestingly the data show a similar pattern to the findings with seven year olds above: high variability manipulations, which are generally very effective with adults, may not have the same benefits for children who actually show stronger learning with less variable input. A paper presenting has been accepted (pending minor revisions) in the journal PeerJ. The data have been presented at various conferences (see Engagement Activities)

We also have data comparing 7 year old's and 11 year old's learning tones in Mandarin Chinese. There is very little previous work in this area in children. The results suggest that both age groups can pick up on tone contrasts simply by playing a word identification game, with no previous explanation of tones and how they work, and can transfer this knowledge to production. They also show that while 11 year old's start off better able to do tone discrimination tasks than 11 year olds (possibly due to task difficulty for the younger group), the two groups show equal learning of the tones when playing the games.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Teachers of second languages /those developing teaching materials can make use of our finding that children may actually benefit from more &amp;quot;narrow&amp;quot; linguistic input which allows them to focus in on key generalizations. 

In the long term, we hope that our findings may also contribute the debate about the age at which second languages should be introduced in schools and thus be of interest to educational policy makers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B89CD5A5-0888-449F-8F0D-A8BEAE2AD63E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/01A2BCDF-6FE9-49E9-878A-C1354738059E"><gtr:id>01A2BCDF-6FE9-49E9-878A-C1354738059E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Learning syntactic categories (gender classes): a language learning study with 7-year-olds</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d2142852a4c166267885a8aac04a0cda"><gtr:id>d2142852a4c166267885a8aac04a0cda</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Elizabeth Wonnacott</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9828C8D6-8EF3-4C3D-8FCD-769B434C3EEF"><gtr:id>9828C8D6-8EF3-4C3D-8FCD-769B434C3EEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do shared distributional contexts aid learning of Italian gender classes in 7-year-old children?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2003ff3cee1e4e2da427daf5183bc441"><gtr:id>2003ff3cee1e4e2da427daf5183bc441</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A60AE814-71E9-4D07-B7A9-84A71CF8326E"><gtr:id>A60AE814-71E9-4D07-B7A9-84A71CF8326E</gtr:id><gtr:title>High or Low?
