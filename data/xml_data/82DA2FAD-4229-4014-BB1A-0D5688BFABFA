It is presently treated with systemic infusion of Baclofen - GABA is a potent inhibitory neurotransmitter prevalent throughout the central nervous system. Although its primary action is in the spinal cord, its uptake is weak if administered orally (25 - 100 mg/day), so intrathecal infusion (ITB) in the spinal cord is widely used (50 - 1500 ug/day). Infusion of baclofen is highly effective in reducing hyper-tonicity of the muscles; however, long term use still has ill effects. This work will exploit standard Micro-Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) processing to form micron scale electrode arrays embedded alongside micro-capillaries with the lowest possible cross-section profile for localized stimulation and sensing in nerves. This is technically challenging and novel and would also permit for the first time a much more detailed and comprehensive study of neuronal interactions and their modulation with a precision at the micron-scale within the spine. Highly localised stimulation both electrical and pharmacological (using directed picolitre quantities of neurotransmitters or their agonist and antagonists), together with electrical sensing both near and far, is unique, allowing a hitherto impossible level of manipulation, understanding and thereby control, of neurological behaviour, and without the drawbacks of systemic or even intrathecal drug treatments. Ultimately the work will be aimed at external control of pain and motor responses using adaptable electronic and pharmacological signals.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Summary of Impact activities:

? Bring together colleagues, both within the University and external partners, interested in developing tools and technologies for use in preclinical and clinical studies in neuroscience and neurology.
? Initiate interdisciplinary discussions in applied neuroscience research
? Facilitate the formation of interdisciplinary research partnerships, with the intention that these lead, in the future, to the submission of funding bids to external agencies.

The workshop was attended by 35 delegates who collectively had interests which spanned the discipline: 11 Biological Scientists (all UoL); 10 Engineers/Physicists (8 UoL, 3 Ext); 7 Clinically-related (5 UoL, 2 Ext); Research and Innovation Support (4 UoL, 1 Ext).

Delegates were engaged with research goals and needs of different research groupings or fields through short presentations by Chakrabarty (FBS: Basic Neurophysiology), Alix (Univ of Sheffield, Clinical Neurophysiology), Steenson (Eng, Neuroengineering) and Williams (RIS, Medical Innovation). These were followed by the keynote lecture entitled &amp;quot;Monitoring Biochemical Parameters- Diagnostics, wearables and implants&amp;quot; delivered by Prof Dermot Diamond (National Centre for Sensor Research, Dublin City Univ).

Following a panel discussion sessions in which presenters responded to questions from the audience, delegates were allocated to three multi-disciplinary/multi-interest groups, each led by a facilitator, to explore the current and future research questions of neuroscientists and clinicians, the technological barriers they face in undertaking this research, and the tools and technologies that exist or could be developed by engineers or physical scientists to overcome these barriers. 

The outcome led to a Network + collaboration bid which was not funded but dialogue continues with some of those involved re a further responsive mode bid.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UK-Turkey Researchers Links Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CDF8AC4C-2E0E-4A58-84D0-FCAFA63F5948</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr C Russell on behalf or the Leeds group (Drs Steenson and Russell) and in relation to the Senseback and Microfluidics Work streams at Leeds attended the workshop with a view of forming alliances and follow-on funding applications for joint UK / Turkey collaborations.

 Considerable time has been taken to develop a methodology to encapsulate the fabricated microfluidic channels and the flip chip method was chosen as a possible path. An AML Aligner Wafer Bonder was required to controllably bond the separate pieces with the precision alignment of the wafers being carried out on a Karl Suss MJB 3 mask aligner. The SU-8 - SU-8 wafer bonding process requires very good temperature control to minimise outgassing, which degrades the bonding process (100+/-5&amp;deg;C and 5kN pressure). 

ADEX
Time has also been spent on studying a new material based on SU-8, trade name ADEX is a Bisphenol-A (epichlorohydrin) epoxy resin based thick dry film sheet (TDFS) manufactured by DJ DevCorp in the USA. It has very good thickness characteristics and its use eliminates many of the waste and complexities of liquid SU-8, due to edge bead and thickness variations obtained with the liquid SU-8 spinning process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Project is just at the half way point and the most challenging phase has been completed.

For the soft layered MEA an insertion tool and post insertion release mechanism, together with a soft and flexible interconnect needed to be developed. The key development was a bespoke end to end hardware and recording tool for both acute and chronic applications. The large number of addressable contacts is considered to help with the 3R's by helping to generate a richer data set requiring fewer animals for the research into neuro-electronics or electrophysiology.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E456A85-1E6F-4FFC-8A41-76E3188E6DD5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Still to be reported and related animal studies pending but several related publications are to be expected now that a firm technological base has been established</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Development of both hard shank and soft shank microelectrode arrays together with soft flexible interconnect and insertion tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Year one challenges involved the establishment of the appropriate research infrastructure and microfabrication processes and materials. This primarily centred around re-establishing previous SU-8 processes using a new set of tools and materials and to upskill and train the new research technician in the micromachining of the photo-patternable polymer SU-8. The previous research students that developed these processes had left after finishing their PhD's and a large part of this first year has been for the research technician to establish and refine existing process knowledge together with ncorporating new processing steps, such as wafer-bonding / capping, which was not used in the past.
Processes have recently been established to satisfy the manufacturing of low cost microelectrode arrays (MEAs) on silicon, and the focus of the work reported here is on forming microscopic microfluidic channels using SU-8 and similar materials with the ultimate goal of integrating these with MEAs for combined electrical and pharmacological measurement and control. 
In detail: SU-8 is used as a readily patternable material although the viscosity for the film thicknesses required for the microfluidic channels does present many associated problems. Controlling the curing (outgassing) and the stresses (effects of thermal shocking) in the films as well as substrate adhesion are all non-trivial, at least initially until the process variables have been understood. A change in patterning tool (KS MJB-3 to EVG610) has also complicated matters but offers the significant potential to pattern much larger areas in the long run, thus reducing fabrication costs and processing time.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1A68390D-274F-445E-8B2F-D6AF32F3A8AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In discussions with groups from UCL, Bristol, Newcastle and the US and Ireland re follow on research applications and adoption of techniques.
