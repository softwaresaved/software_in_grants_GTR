Although it has consistently been shown that children with lesbian mothers do not differ from children in traditional families with respect to psychological adjustment or sex-typed behaviour, the circumstances of children with gay fathers are somewhat different as it is rare for fathers, whether heterosexual or gay, to be primary caregivers. Although research on fathering has shown that heterosexual fathers influence their children in similar ways to mothers, it remains the case that fathers are believed to be less suited to parenting than are mothers. Moreover, children with gay fathers may be exposed to greater stigmatisation than children with lesbian mothers because gay father families possess the additional non-traditional feature of being headed by men. It has also been suggested that the gender development of children with gay fathers may differ from that of children with heterosexual parents or lesbian mothers due to the presence of two male parents and the absence of a female parent from the home. 

Although controversial, in recent years a growing number of gay father families have been created through adoption. The first investigation of adoptive gay father families in the United Kingdom was conducted by the present applicants. Forty-one two-parent gay adoptive families were studied in comparison with 40 two-parent lesbian adoptive families, and 49 two-parent heterosexual adoptive families. The average age of the children was 6 years and the average length of time that they had been placed with their adoptive family was 3 years. Where differences were identified between the gay father families and the lesbian mother or heterosexual parent families, these indicated more positive parental wellbeing and parenting in gay father families. Children's behavioural problems were greater among children in heterosexual than in gay and lesbian families. 

The aim of the present study is to follow up the families when the children reach early adolescence, the time at which identity issues become particularly salient for adopted children and when difficulties in parent-child relationships are most likely to arise. A major advantage of the longitudinal nature of the study is that it will enable the influence of both early and concurrent parent-child relationship quality on adolescent adjustment to be explored. Using standardised interviews, questionnaires and observational methods with parents, adolescents and teachers, data will be obtained on the aspects of parenting that matter most for the psychological adjustment of adolescents including parental warmth, appropriate control and the facilitation of autonomy, and on the social, emotional, gender and identity development of the adolescents. Data will also be obtained on the experiences, attitudes and feelings of the parents and the adolescents themselves regarding their family life. The study will test the hypothesis that adoptive gay father families will experience greater difficulties than adoptive lesbian mother families and adoptive heterosexual parent families when their children reach adolescence. 

Multivariate analysis of covariance will be used to examine whether there are significant differences in family functioning between the different family types; multilevel regression models will be used to examine the relative importance of family structure and quality of parenting in the prediction of adolescent adjustment; and multiple-group latent growth curve models will be used to examine children's behaviour trajectories from age 6 to age 11 and to establish how these vary as a function of parenting processes and family type. Qualitative procedures will be used to analyse the narratives from the sections of the interviews with parents and adolescents on experiences of family life.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The effects on children's psychological development of growing up in a gay father family has been considered in relation to three policy-related areas of family life: (i) child custody disputes involving a gay father (ii) the fostering and adoption of children by gay men, and (iii) access by gay men to assisted reproduction procedures such as surrogacy. The very same assumptions that were made about children in lesbian families more than 30 years ago, i.e. that the children would be ostracised by their peers and confused about their sexual identity, are being voiced today in relation to children raised by gay fathers. It is, therefore, essential that empirical studies are conducted to establish the actual consequences for children of being raised in gay father families in order that policy decisions are based on systematic evidence rather than speculation and assumption. The proposed study provides an opportunity to follow up a sample of gay father families when their children reach early adolescence and thus to establish whether or not the concerns relating to children raised by gay fathers are justified. The findings are of importance as policy decisions and guidelines are under consideration in the UK and other countries in relation to adoption by gay men and access to assisted reproduction by gay men. In addition to the policy implications, the findings will be of value to the clinicians, social workers, and lawyers and judges who make decisions in relation to gay men who wish to adopt a child, access assisted reproduction, or are involved in a custody dispute with the mother of their child. Empirical data on the outcomes for children in gay father families will help inform decision-making by the various professional groups who are confronted with these decisions in their daily lives. Furthermore, the findings of the proposed study will be of direct benefit to gay fathers and their children themselves by providing information about the experiences of other families in similar situations, the difficulties they have encountered, and effective ways of overcoming them. From a theoretical perspective, the findings will be of interest to social scientists, particularly developmental and family psychologists and academics from the related disciplines of sociology, social anthropology, education and child psychiatry, as they will increase understanding of the role of fathers and the influence of parental sexual orientation on the social, emotional, identity and gender development of the child. The findings will be of particular relevance to organisations such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission [EHRC] and Stonewall. The EHRC, established in 2007, is committed to using research to reduce prejudice and promote equality in relation to sexual orientation. Stonewall works with government, trade unions, business, NGOs and policy institutions to achieve equality and justice for lesbian women and gay men. Both organisations have stated that very little is known about gay fathers and their children. The findings from this study will help fill this gap in knowledge and help promote good relations among different groups. The study will also be welcomed by the British Association of Adoption and Fostering and individual adoption agencies as well as support groups for gay fathers such as Gay Dads UK, Pink Parents UK, LGB Parents Manchester and the Lesbian and Gay Foster and Adoptive Parents Network. In addition,the findings will help inform the general public about gay father families. They will also be of value to parents and children in these families who will be able to learn about the experiences of others in a similar situation to themselves.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>407737</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M010015/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>24C2FD61-D899-497D-8F52-D8C590EAD745</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Child Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
