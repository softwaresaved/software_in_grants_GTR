&lt;p>This study aims to develop and validate simple generic tools derived from NPT, to be used to improve the implementation of complex healthcare interventions. Our objectives are to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>develop a set of NPT based measures and formatively evaluate their use for identifying implementation problems and monitoring progress&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>conduct preliminary evaluation of these measures across a range of interventions and contexts, and identify factors that affect this process&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>explore the utility of these measures for predicting outcomes&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>develop an online users' manual for the measures.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>A combination of qualitative (workshops, item development, user feedback, cognitive interviews) and quantitative (survey) methods will be used to develop NPT measures, and test the utility of the measures in a variety of (n=6) healthcare intervention settings. The measures developed in the study will be available for use by those involved in planning, implementing and evaluating complex interventions in healthcare.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>439350</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NoMAD study launch event: Improving healthcare implementation through measurement</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>664D73A3-79A4-4829-B433-B04B2B63F146</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the end of project dissemination event, held at The Kings Fund in London.

The survey has been downloaded over 1000 times since launch (Nov 2015), and the research team are aware of NoMAD being used for data collection in research projects being conducted worldwide. In this report, we focus on three different examples of impact in relation to NoMAD, at this time.

Economic and societal impact ('changing organisational culture and practices'). 

The NPT website, interactive toolkit, and NoMAD survey tool are being embedded into training for care and support planning at Year of Care partnerships (http://www.yearofcare.co.uk )

Year of Care is an NHS based organisation that develops capacity for improving long term condition care using care and support planning. The objective of care and support planning as facilitated by Year of Care is to involve people in their own care, and to provide a more personalised approach and which supports self management. 

We are working with Sue Roberts and Lindsay Oliver, who lead the national training and support team (based in Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust). 

Developments stemming from the project include: 
(1) use of NPT (and interactive online toolkit items) in training workshops to identify barriers and facilitators of care and support planning; 
(2) use of NPT/toolkit to identify and address barriers to engagement of participants in training and delivery of care and support planning in localised NHS organisations; 
(3) adaptation of the NoMAD survey tool for assessing and monitoring the progress of care and support planning, within and across NHS organisations participating in Year of Care training. 

For Year of Care, the application of NPT (and tools we have developed) as part of their training programme represents a shift away from traditional theoretical concepts of practice change drawn from psychological/behavioural models, to a recognition of the need to understand and address wider (contextual, organisational, work-related) issues relevant to embedding practice change.

Academic impact ('enhancing the knowledge economy'). 

The NoMAD survey tool is being incorporated into a research project that is focused on improving tracheostomy care across the UK, funded by the Health Foundation. 

Led by the Royal College of Anaesthetists, Tracy Finch is working with the project team (Brendan McGrath (RCA, Mike Firn, Springfield Consultancy) on a consultancy basis to adapt, administer and analyse the results of a package of quality improvement interventions to improve safety and outcomes for tracheostomy patients, across a minimum of 20 sites in the UK. These sites are already recruited, with baseline survey data collected. 

Not only is the NoMAD tool central to the generating the research evidence, and so affecting change in the delivery of tracheostomy care, but this collaboration also represents a significant extension of ongoing validation on the NoMAD survey tool. This includes: (1) further testing and comparing results across large numbers of sites and (2) assessment of the survey for detecting change over time through repeated assessments.


Academic impact (Worldwide academic advancement). 

The NPT/NoMAD tools have been central to achieving multi-national research funding worth 6 million Euros from the European Commission (Horizon 2020). 

Commencing in January 2017, ImplementAll is a four year study involving 18 partners across the world. The project will develop, apply and evaluate tailored implementation strategies in the context of on-going e-Health implementation initiatives in mental health services. 

Tracy Finch and Tim Rapley (with Carl May) will lead the work on developing and delivering theory-based tailored implementation of e-health in a range of settings (with academic, public and private care providers) in the UK, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Kosovo, Albania, and Australia. 

This work will break new ground in the evaluation of theory-based implementation approaches as it represents a shift of focus away from evaluating effectiveness of services, to evaluating and advancing implementation strategies for maximising benefit of service initiatives. The evaluation will include the NoMAD tool as a key 'success' measure of the implementation strategies to be tested. 

Undertaking the project will require further translation of NoMAD into several European languages. NoMAD has already been translated into Dutch and Swedish since being launched in Nov 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>45EC6C34-E70F-4579-ACD4-3AED2748C727</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We describe four key achievements: 

1. We have developed and evaluated a 23-item implementation measurement tool (NoMAD) that reflects implementation process as explained by Normalization Process Theory (NPT) (Objectives 1-3). Tested on 6 different interventions being implemented in different settings (831 respondents), the tool has excellent face validity and construct validity, and adequate to good reliability (internal consistency) for the items representing the four theoretical constructs. Working with individual implementation project leads, we observed a range of ways in sites could use the data available from NoMAD, including making comparisons between groups, triangulating data sources within large projects, and achieving buy-in and staff representation during early stages of implementation. NoMAD provides users of NPT with a theory based assessment tool that is easy to adapt and administer in their work settings. The NoMAD tool has been downloaded over 300 times in 3 months since launch (18/11/15), by academic and non-academic users from all over the world.

2. We have upgraded the NPT website (http://normalizationprocess.org), and extended it to include the NoMAD survey tool (Objective 6). A new section for NoMAD is included, that explains the study, provides practical guidance on using the NoMAD tool, and allows users to download it. The website also has improved: aesthetics and design, interactivity with search engines, functionality with mobile devices, and linking with user metrics for assessing impact. 

3. Through NoMAD, we have significantly advanced knowledge in understanding and measuring implementation processes and outcomes (Objectives 1-4). We undertook a comprehensive tool development process, involving a range of approaches with different users (those delivering interventions, supervising/managing, evaluating, as well as 'experts' in NPT), in iterative rounds of data collection, analysis and project team workshops. This process has deepened our understanding of the complexity of implementation work, and of how any efforts at 'measuring' implementation activity must account for this complexity (see website: 'How to use NoMAD'). This work has extended our understanding of NPT and how to apply it (Objective 4), through the formal research activity undertaken (eg. experiences of working with site contacts, interpretation of statistical data supporting the theoretical assumptions of NPT); and through interactive workshops run by project members with diverse user groups (health care professionals, service managers/providers, complex interventions researchers, postgraduate students) where we have helped others work through examples using the NPT tools. 

4. We have already developed new collaborations nationally and internationally, as a direct outcome of the project. NoMAD is already being used in a study of person-centred care in nursing homes, led by Boston University (RECHARGE study). In Europe, NoMAD is being translated to Dutch for use in a study of the implementation of e-mental health (MasterMind project, VU Amsterdam), with other language translations expected to follow. Nationally, NoMAD will be used in a Health Foundation funded project aimed at improving Tracheostomy care at a national level, commencing in March 2016. Further collaboration opportunities are being discussed, and the project team (Tracy Finch and Tim Rapley) will continue to extend the work of NoMAD in these settings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our Pathways to Impact document still reflects our expectation of impact from the project. These plans focused on making Normalization Process Theory more 'usable' for a wide range of academic and non-academic users through the development of a survey instrument that could be adapted for use in different contexts, including research but also by those who are undertaking implementation projects as part of service development (e.g. within the NHS). As described under 'main achievements' above, we already have evidence of a high level of interest in the NoMAD instrument from diverse users, and have established collaborations with partners who are already using it in research (eg. RECHARGE study of patient-centred care, Boston University; MasterMind project implementing e-mental health in Europe, Vree University Amsterdam; The Royal College of Anaesthetists' Tracheostomy project, UK), or planning to use it (eg: Implementation of enhanced recovery after surgery, Bristol University; 'Checklist' project for patient centredness, University of Southampton). 
Through the contacts that we are receiving about NoMAD, we will particularly seek out opportunities to evaluate its impact in service development and implementation in non-academic (real world) settings as a tool for shaping and improving implementation success, as well as assessing progress in implementation efforts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6CAC9E53-DC2A-452A-A8B8-8EB451D3CC00</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.normalizationprocess.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This is the main practical output of the project. It is a 23-item implementation measurement tool (NoMAD) that reflects implementation process as explained by Normalization Process Theory (NPT). It is intended to be used by those implementing new practice based interventions (academic or non-academic settings) and has potential for understanding barriers and facilitators to successful implementation, and for helping to direct improvement efforts as an implementation process progresses.
