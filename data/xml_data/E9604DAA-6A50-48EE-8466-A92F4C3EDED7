Many of the genes which regulate fat and glucose metabolism are sensitive to changes in nutritional during fetal development, therefore may be affected by maternal over, or under-nutrition. If these genetic changes are long-lasting and persist into adulthood they may impair the physiological and endocrine systems in the offspring and lead to disease such as type 2 (or age onset) diabetes or obesity. Similarly, low birth weight offspring, who may have experienced sub-optimal conditions in the womb, are also at an increased risk of metabolic diseases and often develop greater fat stores than their normal weight siblings. The exact timing and type of nutritional imbalance may be crucial in determining the outcome for the offspring. The proposed study will use a pig model to investigate the effect of a high fat or high protein diet during 2 key stages of pregnancy; early, when the placenta is developing and; late, when the fetus is growing rapidly. The study will also investigate whether a high fat or protein diet at these key stages has any additional benefit, or risk for the low birth weight pig. The pig is an excellent model in which to investigate the effects of maternal diet, the digestive physiology is similar to the human and components of the diet can be altered easily. Tissue samples of fat and muscle, which are import in the regulation of fat and glucose metabolism, will be taken from the offspring at 7 days of postnatal age and at 6 months. Low and normal birth weight offspring will be examined to determine any birth weight specific effects. These times have been selected in order in investigate the effect of maternal diet on the newborn infant and also in the older pig. Expression of key genes which regulate lipid and glucose metabolism, such as insulin receptors, will be measured. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue will be examined to determine energy stores of fat and also glycogen (the body's long term storage of glucose); as in some cases of obesity, fat is stored outside adipose tissue in muscle. Storage of fat outside of adipose tissue is referred to as 'ectopic' and can be linked to type-2 diabetes, in a commercially important species like the pig, excess fat in muscle can be detrimental - especially with pressure from the public for lean meat. Hormones and metabolites, such as glucose, insulin and cortisol will be measured in blood samples from the sow and her offspring. These results will inform us of the effects of an increased diet during different stages on gestation on the outcome for the newborn and older pig. The results from this work will be useful in determining the gatekeeper genes which are altered during periods of increased nutrition in pregnancy and highlight potential strategies for intervention, such as public health information on diet or drug targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Animal and human epidemiological studies have established that sub-optimal maternal diet throughout pregnancy results in offspring that are at increased risk of later metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. This has become known as the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. Many DOHaD studies are based upon under-nutrition during pregnancy; however, dietary excess is more characteristic of the diets consumed by many pregnant women in the developed world. Many regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism are nutritionally sensitive in the developing fetus and, if altered, may transmit long-lasting adverse changes to the offspring. Low birth weight offspring may be particularly at risk. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of increased lipid or protein in the maternal diet outcome of median and low birth weight offspring. Sows have been assigned to one of 6 dietary groups assessing the impact of high protein or high fat in early or late gestation. Maternal blood and milk samples have been taken regularly during pregnancy and lactation. At birth, two median and two low birth weight piglets have been selected from each litter and humanely euthanased on day 7 or 6 months of postnatal age to enable sampling of all major organs and tissues. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle will be analysed using real time PCR and western blotting for expression of key regulators of glucose and fat metabolism. Histological analysis of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle will be carried out to establish the lipid content and location. Tissue lipid and glycogen content will be assessed using biochemical methods. Data from plasma and sow milk hormone and metabolite concentrations will be available to integrate with molecular findings. The findings from this study will provide key information on the effect of over-nutrition during pregnancy on offspring outcome and future health with particular reference to the metabolic syndrome.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>323449</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Schothorst Feed Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>SFR collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>990133F6-BB35-44E2-B7C4-83A0CC6AAC74</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The SFR partners conducted all of the animal work which would have cost at least EUR100K.

Influence of maternal diet on offspring mortality: we have demonstrated that both a fat (FS) and protein supplemented (PS) diet caused increased neonatal mortality - particularly due to crushing by the sow (postnatal mortality (% of litter) Control=3, FS=17 and PS= 12). The reason why there were many more neonatal deaths in the dietary intervention groups is unknown, but the FS sows experienced impaired glucose tolerance in late gestation. Impaired glucose metabolism in the sow may have exposed the fetal piglets to excessive glucose during late gestation; after birth, the sudden drop in glucose due to removal of the placental supply could lead to hypoglycaemia and impairment of piglet cognition. Contrary to previous work, we did not demonstrate an increase in litter number with FS or PS. 

Impact of diet and birth-weight on early muscle development: skeletal muscle (SkM) development was improved in the HF offspring at 7 days when compared to the HP and control groups. When SkM was examined, we found biochemical, histological and molecular changes which indicated accelerated maturation; these changes included increased muscle fibre cross-sectional area, increased storage of glycogen (a key energy source), increased expression of glycolytic genes and fatty acid profiles suggestive of muscle development. Piglets in the HF group also grew faster up to 7 days of postnatal age. Piglets that experienced a sub-optimal environment in utero - low BW (&amp;quot;runt&amp;quot;) and median BW piglets whose mothers had been fed a reduced energy content (inverse) diet in late gestation also demonstrated SkM changes. Most strikingly, piglets exposed to the inverse diet in utero displayed SkM and plasma changes indicative of reduced energy availability and potential delayed muscle development.
 
Effect of diet and birth-weight on adipose tissue at maturity: By 6 months, the impact of diet and low BW was most significant in adipose tissue, with little effect on SkM. Notably, irrespective of BW; offspring born to FS sows exhibited a fatty acid and gene expression profile indicative of beneficial anti-inflammatory responses. 

Effect of aging on adipose tissue: The fatty acid profile of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was acutely affected by aging; most of those increasing with age were saturated fatty acids. Increasing age increased expression of genes associated with inflammation but decreased the expression of genes involved in breaking down fat. 

Taken together these results indicate that a FS diet has opposing differential effects on piglet offspring outcome. FS (and PS) caused increased neonatal mortality, but the FS offspring that survived had improved SkM development at 7 days and by 6 months exhibited adipose tissue markers consistent with improved inflammatory responses suggestive of reduced risk of metabolic disease.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings only look as far as 6 months of age -
