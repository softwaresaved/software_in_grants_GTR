&lt;p>Using interviews and surveys with 108 people using services and carers in 27 case study organisations, across three English local authorities, this research will compare outcomes and value for money across micro, small, medium and large care providers (categorised by the number of staff working in them).The project will recruit and train people using services and carers as co-researchers, involved in research design, interviewing, data analysis and dissemination.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project aims to produce findings that are of direct relevance to local authorities, service users and other organisations as they commission care services, and to social entrepreneurs as they develop provision. It also aims to deepen social scientific knowledge of the relationship between organisational size and performance in welfare services, of relevance to academics working in fields such as social policy and public management.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries set out in the earlier section, this research will benefit a wide range of groups: 

- Service users as they develop support plans and commission care services. 
- Frontline social care staff as they support service users in developing support plans and commission care services. 
- Local authority care teams as they commission services.
- Social entrepreneurs as they develop provision.
- Think tanks undertaking research on the changes to provider markets in the context of personalisation and personal budgets. 
- Charities redesigning their services in the context of personalisation, including setting up social enterprises. 
- National government policy makers, such as those within the Department of Health and within arms-length bodies such as Think Local, Act Personal, who may particularly be interested in research into cost-effectiveness in care provision.
- National professional bodies such as the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and the British College of Social Work.
- Local policy makers, seeking to better understand their local care markets and how they are changing. 
- Regulators such as the Care Quality Commission seeking to better understand the relationship between organisational size and performance, and the relationship between qualitative and quantititave outcome data.

The research will contribute to the nation's health through enhancing understanding about what makes for effective practice and organisational design in care markets. This finding has enormous potential impact given that over 1.5 million people use social care services, but that services in the recent past have been characterised by large scale provision often dependent on 15 minute care visits by large care providers or the 'warehousing' of disabled and elderly people in large day centres (Glasby and Littlechild, 2009). As people move towards purchasing more of their own care through personal budgets, it is vital that service users themselves and those that support them (informal carers and social care professionals) better understand how organisational size and performance interact. This research will help care users, professionals and policy makers to understand when and how micro-enterprises can contribute to improved service outcomes and how far micro-enterprises can deliver value for money in a very tight financial context. It will also help people working in or setting up micro-enterprises to understand the advantages and disadvantages of their size and to work to ensure maximum effectiveness. 

Key to achieving impact is working with charities, professional bodies and the trade press to disseminate findings through their professional networks, as discussed in the Pathways to Impact statement. The topline findings from the project can start being shared through those channels as soon as the writing-up stage is complete, and should be able to make an immediate impact on those people who are currently designing their support plans. In the context of personalisation it is expected that no one will be tied into a long-term contract with a provider and therefore that they should be able to rework their support plan within a short time scale. However, in practice people are unlikely to want to make constant changes to their support plan, so it is recognised that maximum benefit is likely to come as service users are designing their support plans or those plans are being reviewed; and for service providers at the time that they start trading or undertake a service review. 

Staff working on the project will develop or consolidate skills at working with co-researchers, undertaking research with a range of organisational types; and comparing different types of data.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>357580</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog for the RSA</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8276C6B6-C629-44A9-8775-67A90C46B234</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog for the RSA to tie-in with the publication of their report about micro-businesses.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2015/06/why-the-future-of-social-care-lies-with-micro-businesses/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Warwickshire County Council - presentation of micro-enterprise research findings</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D4E3BC98-D834-466C-A2DC-9343BDD2024F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We presented the findings from the micro-enterprise project to an audience of 25 commissioners of adult and children's social care services, and discussed with them the dilemmas they face in encouraging micro-enterprise development in their area.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Social care for marginalised communities: understanding self-organisation for micro-provision'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27318809-08F5-440D-9EFA-D3DFB617440B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog on the Health Services Management Centre website, http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/social-policy/departments/health-services-management-centre/news/viewpoint/2014/social-care-for-marginalised-communities.aspx

The short-term impacts were to be on influencing the immediate research environment, particularly in building the research capacity of the 18 co-researchers (people who had experience of using care services or of caring for someone who used them). A year after the research has finished, we can see that this capacity-building has been achieved. Researchers with learning disabilities in one site have been approached by the local authority to discuss ways to use the research findings to reshape service provision in that locality. They are also working with a local provider to develop quality measures from a service user perspective. Researchers in another locality have contributed to experts-by-experience focus groups for a National Institute of Health Research-funded project on decommissioning health services. Most significantly, in terms of building long-term research skills, one of the co-researchers will be a co-investigator on a Department of Health Policy Research Programme grant into care market-shaping starting in October 2016. This involves working alongside the same team of academic researchers who undertook the Micro-Enterprise project, with a specific role in leading the co-researcher recruitment and training. The other 17 co-researchers from the Micro-Enterprise project will also be invited back to undertake interviews on this new project, providing an opportunity to use and further deepen the skills acquired through the earlier research. 
The medium-term impacts we set out in the Pathways to Impact statement were as follows. 
? In the year following the end of the award, the findings will be disseminated through a range of local and national events, academic and press articles and a website, involving case study sites and people, but also the broader social care practitioner, user and policy communities. 
In the engagement and publications section of ResearchFish we have detailed the activities we have undertaken to disseminate the findings, through reports and videos on our project website, as well as blogs and articles in outlets such as the Department of Health Social Care blog, the Social Care Institute for Excellence website and Community Care magazine. We also held an ESRC Festival of Social Science event for local commissioners and providers of care services, which was attended by over 40 people. Two county councils invited us to training events to present findings to commissioners from adult and childrens' social care teams. Within Kent, the event we ran (which was in association with Care Coops UK) encouraged Care UnLtd - a local social enterprise in Kent - to set up a funding programme specifically for micro enterprise, and our research will inform the design of that programme. 

Tracing a direct impact on social care practice is difficult to do, and we see our impact on improving the quality of social care as being a scaffolding process, where widespread interest in our micro-enterprise findings has led to us being commissioned to undertake further research. The quality and relevance of our research on micro-enterprises has enabled us to bid successfully for a large (&amp;pound;550,000) Department of Health Policy Research Programme grant on implementation of the Care Act. This project focuses specifically on market-shaping, and in the research proposal we drew directly on the micro-enterprise project findings to highlight both the problems exhibited in local care systems, and our own expertise in understanding the dynamics of care markets, and what constitutes 'good care'. Beginning this new project in October 2016 gives us enhanced access to Department of Health policy-makers, and opportunities to connect the micro-enterprise findings into broader initiatives to improve care systems. 
The long-term impacts we set out in the Pathways to Impact statement were to embed the findings in our university teaching. We have done this during the academic year 2015-16, delivering sessions for MSc students taking Healthcare Policy and Management, Public Management; for trainee social workers on the Step Up programme; and for a cohort of international MSc students from the University of Melbourne. Since these courses involve people who are working part-time in practice (or on placements in the case of social workers) we used the sessions to encourage students to consider how to utilize the findings in their own practice. For example, social workers have an opportunity to consider what our respondents meant by 'person-centred care'. Commissioners, taking the Public Management programme, are urged to examine how far their commissioning practices support or inhibit very small providers of care. These modules are delivered annually and provide an opportunity to embed the findings from the research among practitioners over the long-term.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D8DB5CF1-3F7B-439F-9346-4374968085DA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Micro-enterprises (MEs) in the care sector perform better than larger care provided on the four research questions addressed in the project (outcomes for individuals; person-centredness; innovation; value for money) 

1. Outcomes data for individuals (derived from the Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit) showed that MEs scored more highly than the national average on the two domains that were tested: could people do what they wanted with their time; and could they have more choice and control. In the case study sites, MEs also outperformed larger care organisations on the first domain question, but differences on the second domain question were not statistically significant. Qualitative data from the interviews indicated that, in relation to day activities, some interviewees enjoyed the wider variety of activities offered by larger providers. 

2. MEs offer more person-centred care than larger care organisations. The more personalised care provided by the MEs, especially for care and support delivered in the home stemmed from the:

a. Autonomy of front-line staff to vary the service being offered
b. Continuity of front-line staff 
c. Accessibility of managers to frontline staff and people using services

3. MEs were found to be more innovative than larger providers in delivering more flexible and person-centred care, and in involving people who use services and their families in setting up and running MEs. 

4. Price data indicated that the hourly rate for micro-enterprises was slightly below that of larger providers. This was not at the expense of quality, (as indicated by the interviews and ASCOT questions). With the larger providers the cheapest prices were offered by those that conformed to the 15 minute care visit model. The more expensive larger providers were able to match the micro-enterprise offer more closely, providing longer care visits and better staff continuity.

? Enabling factors for the sustainable success of MEs include: dedicated support for start-up and development; strong personal networks within a locality; and maintaining an independent status. Barriers for MEs include few local authority referrals leading to a reliance on self-funders; the difficulty of maintaining a staffing base with only a small number of clients; and the financial fragility of the organisations, some of which were failing to cover their costs. 

? We used a measure of size based on staff numbers and took a snapshot of performance at a given time. However we saw change in some organisations' size during the life of the research project, highlighting the importance of studying size in a longitudinal way in future research. We also found that size was an identity as much as a metric: some organisations which exceeded our size thresholds still identified as micro-enterprises, and articulated an ethos which had more in common with other MEs than with larger organisations. 

? The research was undertaken with co-researchers who had experience of using services (older people, people with learning disabilities and carers). This strengthened service user and carer perspectives throughout the study, assured greater validity of the research findings and brought new perspectives and skills to the academic researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>? Our findings are directly relevant to the implementation of the Care Act 2014 which creates a potentially fertile environment for micro-enterprises, given its focus on stimulating a diverse local market of community-based providers (and closer links to the health sector). We envisage that our findings around enablers/barriers for MEs will be relevant to national and local care commissioners as they develop market-shaping capabilities, and to providers as they learn the benefits of small-scale provision. 

? Local launch events have raised the profile of the research with service users and carers, and the organisations that represent them. 

? Project partners and co-researchers are starting to make use of the research findings. For example SCIE and Community Catalysts are citing the work in their own publications. Co-researchers in one locality have been asked to work with the local authority on improving local disability services. 

? Academics will be able to draw on the findings from the research to develop knowledge on: the link between organisational size and performance (Public Management); the links between process, quality and price in care services (Social Policy); and the implications of working with co-researchers (Methodology).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>198FFCF9-EA21-413D-B20C-157B0F656523</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/micro-enterprises/index.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/254BE41E-48A5-47D7-89F8-C6440D3C50C8"><gtr:id>254BE41E-48A5-47D7-89F8-C6440D3C50C8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Organisational size and performance in public services: what is the right scale for delivering care services?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a6b02df60d7b018b4c566857e56e0e7d"><gtr:id>a6b02df60d7b018b4c566857e56e0e7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hally, K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/806DBDC1-FFB3-4FB6-8475-F1DE2F192FA9"><gtr:id>806DBDC1-FFB3-4FB6-8475-F1DE2F192FA9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Micro-enterprises and personalisation: what size is good care?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3439a5253ed64cac17ccd1b8f205a0cb"><gtr:id>3439a5253ed64cac17ccd1b8f205a0cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Needham, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4651141D-75A9-4245-B133-04EF1FB1D31F"><gtr:id>4651141D-75A9-4245-B133-04EF1FB1D31F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Micro-provision of Social Care Support for Marginalized Communities - Filling the Gap or Building Bridges to the Mainstream?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Policy and Administration</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1d43d9e0438839386fccb2c77159514b"><gtr:id>1d43d9e0438839386fccb2c77159514b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Needham, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/180DF1B8-CF21-475E-B918-A8287939B0C0"><gtr:id>180DF1B8-CF21-475E-B918-A8287939B0C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Grass Roots Entrepreneurship and Innovation: Micro-Enterprise in Social Care</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Research Society for Public Managers (IRSPM)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ba67feb2555b4f3d869131cab49874b0"><gtr:id>ba67feb2555b4f3d869131cab49874b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Kelly Hall (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AECCA407-E975-4A61-9C70-4518A6919CE3"><gtr:id>AECCA407-E975-4A61-9C70-4518A6919CE3</gtr:id><gtr:title>'The Goldilocks Question: What Size is 'Just Right' for Social Care Organisations?'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1d43d9e0438839386fccb2c77159514b"><gtr:id>1d43d9e0438839386fccb2c77159514b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Needham, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CCE8FA65-9BAA-4210-BBBB-B2BF7A097D50"><gtr:id>CCE8FA65-9BAA-4210-BBBB-B2BF7A097D50</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social care for marginalised communities: understanding self-organisation for micro-provision</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4ee7bd5c75649656f8a7a7336ee57980"><gtr:id>4ee7bd5c75649656f8a7a7336ee57980</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carr, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/757B83AF-8CDD-413C-B9C5-228B953CE010"><gtr:id>757B83AF-8CDD-413C-B9C5-228B953CE010</gtr:id><gtr:title>Micro-enterprises: small enough to care?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3439a5253ed64cac17ccd1b8f205a0cb"><gtr:id>3439a5253ed64cac17ccd1b8f205a0cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Needham, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K002317/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp;
