Turbines for power generation and aircraft propulsion contribute a notable fraction of emissions; it has been estimated that aircraft alone will be contributing 5-15% of anthropomorphic warming by 2050. If emissions are to be reduced these turbines must become more efficient. The most recent 4th generation of superalloys offer the possibility of running safely at higher temperatures, which would significantly boost the turbine's efficiency. However, these alloys are critically dependent on rare, strategic metals like Rhenium with considerable volatility in price and availability - to the point where the use of these new alloys may be restricted. An alternative alloy or material, with excellent high temperature properties but lower dependency on scarce resources, could be significantly more sustainable in the long-run. The materials known as in situ composites are one option.

In situ composites consist of a matrix, normally a conventional nickel superalloy, that contains many aligned micrometre-scale transition metal carbide fibres that are grown as the composite solidifies. The carbide fibres are very stable and strong, even at the extreme temperatures in a gas turbine, and reinforce the matrix allowing it to operate at higher temperatures than normal. Importantly, this can be accomplished without the addition of Rhenium. However, the deformation behaviour of in situ composites is difficult to understand and we currently have little ability to predict their long-term reaction to use in a turbine. A particularly interesting phenomenon thought to be exhibited by in situ composites is the 'memory effect'. In most cases, a high temperature component, such as a turbine blade, must be removed from service and replaced when it has deformed beyond a critical amount. Damaged blades made of in situ composites may only require a short heat treatment to recover their original life span and dimensions. Unfortunately, the memory effect has only been reported on a few occasions and at the moment little is known about how it occurs or the conditions needed to initiate it. If this phenomenon can be proved to occur and the underlying mechanisms understood, it would substantially increase the life span of turbine components. Used components could be returned to active service, at a greatly reduced expenditure of energy, and so greatly improving the sustainability of the industry.

The behaviour of in situ composites is thought to depend heavily on the interaction between the superalloy matrix and the carbide fibres providing the reinforcement, in particular the transfer of load to the fibres as deformation progresses. This project will use novel measurement techniques, such as synchrotron X-ray diffraction, to perform rapid experiments to directly determine the stresses and strains in the material as it is undergoing deformation and experiencing the memory effect. X-ray methods provide a direct measure of the strain experienced by each phase and so reveal how load is passed to the fibres, how the matrix is deforming and even the onset of fibre fracture. This data will be complemented by advanced microstructural analysis methods such as electron backscattered diffraction, which can quantify the state of the material after deformation. Combining these advanced methods will allow us to determine the underlying physics governing these novel materials. This data will be used to adapt a set of creep models in order to predict the behaviour of in situ composites. This data will be vital in developing the next generation of turbine materials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The UK has the world's 2nd largest gas turbine industry and the largest in Europe. There are several major producers with several thousand secondary companies feeding in components and services of all kinds. As such the industry is a major employer and generates significant export revenues (greater than &amp;pound;2 billion in the power generation industry alone). This industry is currently heavily dependent on rare strategic metals like Rhenium to produce nickel superalloys with the properties needed to operate in the fierce conditions inside gas turbines. Significant price fluctuations have been identified as a major short term issue for the uptake of the latest generation of superalloys which contain greater quantities of Re (and similar scarce elements). The limited number of sources for these metals is likely to create further pressure in the mid- to long-term and has strategic implications given the importance of superalloys in military aircraft. In situ composites offer the possibility of reducing our dependency on difficult to acquire elements while still providing the high temperature strength required by turbine materials. They will offer a distinct option for improving the sustainability of the gas turbine industry and will remove a key choke point in resource acquisition if it can be shown that they possess the necessary properties.

The reduction of CO2 emissions and improved efficiency is a critical issue with the UK legally committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. Turbines for power generation and aircraft propulsion contribute a notable fraction of emissions; it has been estimated that aircraft alone will be contributing 5-15% of anthropomorphic warming by 2050. The Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE) have identified improved high temperature materials as a &amp;quot;key enabler for most, if not all, of the future power plant improvements&amp;quot; and that such improvements will be vital if the aerospace industry is to achieve keytargets e.g. 50% reduction in fuel burn and CO2 emissions. The most recent 4th generation of superalloys offer the possibility of running safely at higher temperatures, which would significantly boost the turbine's efficiency, but the aforementioned issues may prevent their widespread use. In situ composites could offer the necessary high temperature properties and so contribute to reducing emissions while being practical and economical to implement. 

In situ composites are expensive to make but this could be offset by the 'memory effect' they exhibit where deformed components can be returned to their original shape by a simple heat treatment. This phenomenon would permit the easy and straightforward recycling and reuse of ageing turbine blades thus using far less energy and resources than the production of replacements. It is anticipated that companies like Rolls-Royce and Alstom could benefit significantly from the exploitation of this effect, which would potentially offer notable savings for operators. This can only occur if the memory effect is properly understood. Fortunately, modern experimental methods, such as those outlined in this research programme, offer excellent possibilities for elucidating precisely how in situ composites accommodate load and strain at high temperature, how they are partitioned to the different phases and subsequently relax during heat treatment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97484</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cambridge Metallurgy</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0FADBB9-CAEA-41A7-BB75-5D83A4028DAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>not yet applicable</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Production of specimens, technical expertise and advice, assistance in writing beam time application</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Writing and obtaining synchrotron beam time, performing the experiments and beginning data analysis</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project was undertaken in order to see if insitu composites, one of several alternatives to current turbine materials, show a 'memory effect', where the composite recovers its dimensions after deformation. 

The results gained so far do not suggest that such an effect occurs. However, this is mainly due to significant technical challenges that prevented us producing material in the expected form. The non-aligned composite (essentially normal cast material) is unlikely to show a large macroscopic memory effect so it is not surprising that none was observed. X-ray measurements on the material did not indicate a measurable relaxation of either the nickel base or the carbide reinforcement. However, the measurements were extremely noisy and a small relaxation would not be seen.

We have implemented a microbeam deformation method, where a micron-sized cantilever is made using a focussed-ion beam and then mechanically deformed. This was used to test the interfacial strength of the carbide and the nickel matrix. The results suggested that the assumption of excellent bonding between the two is valid. The material was substantially more ductile than is seen macroscopically suggesting a change in deformation/fracture mechanism at this length-scale. This work resulted in the recruitment of a PhD student.

We have developed an image analysis technique for dealing with saturation spots arising on X-ray detectors due to large grains of nickel dominating the image compared to the fine rings arising from the eutectic. Currently, noise arising from the spots results in noise rather greater than any expected signal. This method will have implications for a number of materials we are examining, especially in the High Temperature Centre, where grain sizes are typically large compared to ideal diffraction conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Given the failure to achieve the project objectives it seems unlikely the results will be taken on by other researchers or engineers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>60DA3165-B65F-489A-A33E-DA86504997DF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K016628/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3DA0C45A-BB41-4C35-A977-05FCC6966C8C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials testing &amp; eng.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
