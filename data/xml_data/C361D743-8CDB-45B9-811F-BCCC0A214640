In August 2016, Prof Michael Burton, formerly of the University of New South Wales in Australia, was appointed as Director, the first joint Director of the Observatory and Planetarium. One of his core remits was to ensure that the Research being conducted at the Observatory and elsewhere was better communicated to the wider public through the Planetarium and its outreach activities. AOP is core funded through the N. Ireland Executive through the Department for Communities who are keen for us to develop closer relationships with schools throughout N. Ireland, especially where astronomy can engage with topics in the School Curriculum. This bid for an STFC Public Engagement Small Award is part of this strategy.

This new initiative builds on recent work undertaken by both the Observatory and Planetarium staff. A highlight of recent outreach activities has been the work of its UK European Universe Awareness (EU-UNAWE) Project where we had a programme of primary-sector teacher training courses. As well as showing a range of shows in the Planetarium and visitor center, more specialised events such as Career advise in Science and Engineering, and `Minecraft' days, are held on a regular basis. To help meet the growing demand for more science education, AOP will contribute to the development of the Nation's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce of the future through a diverse portfolio of education initiatives that target students at all levels, including those in traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities.

In this bid we request modest funding to enhance our engagement with school children of all ages by inviting two of STFC's Public Engagement Fellows to give an initial series of talks to school children ranging in age from 6 to 18, careers advice to 15-18 year old female students and to assist AOP's Education Officers to continue these activities after they leave. We would anticipate the funding to cover the T&amp;amp;S costs of the Engagement Fellows each for a three-four day visit, with additional costs for materials and (essentially) part-costs of bringing the school children to the Planetarium.

We wish to cover two of STFC's astronomy research areas which are related to research being carried out at AOP; solar physics and gravitational wave astronomy. Planned workshops/talks include 'Our Dynamic Sun' - for secondary schools (11-15 year olds); 'The Sun, space and us' (also covering Tim Peake's flight on the ISS) for primary schools (~7-11 year olds), 'Beyond the rainbow' presentation to 6-8 year olds, using UV beads, art. Talks to groups of female students (~15-18 year olds) and teachers about 'Careers in Science, Engineering and Technology'. We also plan student masterclasses and workshops on gravitational wave astronomy to be given to A-level students.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As part of the preparation for these events, we would work closely with Drs Mason and North and the associated Artist to create information packs and material which can be taken away by the school groups. This material will be used for future projects which AOP will develop and the skills and knowledge gained from these events will be retained. As part of the post-project evaluation AOP will hold sessions where staff will access how they thought which aspects of the events worked well and which worked less well. This will directly influence future events. Although Drs Mason and North have presented similar education projects to the ones outlined here in England, neither has presented them in Northern Ireland. These events will therefore be `tried and tested' although presented in a new setting and environment.

Also, we will:
a) use the AOP social media outlets i.e. Facebook Page and Twitter to raise awareness of the project
b) set up an event for the project to raise awareness on Facebook in which teachers can view the workshops.
c) use images on Facebook/twitter/Instagram to raise awareness
d) utilise the Planetarium and Observatory websites to have information on the project and have downloadable information available as PDF's
e) send information to schools about the project through the AOP teacher Packs which are given to each school that visits AOP.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P005837/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
