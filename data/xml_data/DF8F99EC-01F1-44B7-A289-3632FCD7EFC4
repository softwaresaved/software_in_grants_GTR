Definable sets (solutions sets of first order formulas in a structure) play a central role, akin to that of constructible sets in algebraic geometry. Model theory has successfully identified abstract notions of independence (e.g. non-forking) which generalise linear and algebraic independence, along with notions of dimension and measure for definable sets, and orthogonality between them. These have come from model-theoretic stability theory, but techniques from stability theory have recently been shown to apply in much wider contexts (simple theories, NIP theories, theories where part of the structure is stable, even `NTP2' theories). As a result, the techniques have had applications not just for stable structures, but in much richer mathematical contexts.

The usual objects of model-theoretic study are infinite, but in this project we adapt and apply model-theoretic methods to classes of finite structures, often going via their infinite limits; these are usually ultraproducts, but sometime direct and inverse limits. The project has several facets, but at the heart is a brand new notion of a `multidimensional asymptotic class' (m.a.c.). This is a class of finite structures in which definable families of definable sets satisfy a very strong uniformity in their asymptotic sizes, which takes into account that orthogonal parts of a structure can vary independently. For example, for any positive integers d,e, the set of all groups which are direct products of at most d finite simple group of Lie rank at most e, is an m.a.c. The precise definition of `m.a.c.' is complex, but has much clearer meaning in any ultraproduct, where each definable set is assigned a value in a certain semiring, related to the `Grothendieck semiring'. We will develop the model-theoretic properties of m.a.c.s and their ultraproducts, and search for what looks like a plentiful supply of mathematically interesting examples, coming from algebra (especially group theory and representation theory) and from graph theory. 

In the project we aim for group-theoretic applications (e.g. to the active current topic of word maps) and to connections to related work of Hrushovski on approximate subgroups, of Gowers on quasirandom groups, and to zero-one laws in finite combinatorics. We will also develop a slightly distinct but related model theory for profinite structures, aiming, for example, to classify profinite groups which, in a 2-sorted language, have NIP theory.

We approach this subject from infinite model theory, but there are connections to finite model theory, which takes its motivation from theoretical computer science and complexity theory. Our methods will give understanding of definable sets in very many classes of finite structures, some (e.g. graphs) of strong interest to finite model theory. We will actively develop links between finite and infinite model theory.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is expected to have academic beneficiaries not just within model theory, but in other parts of mathematics, in particular group theory and possibly other parts of algebra, and combinatorics. We also expect benefit for finite model theorists working in computer science departments. There is already UK strength in model theory, and in its connections to group theory. Thus, the project will reinforce research activity in an area of UK strength, and stimulate interactions with other academic fields.

The project will have considerable impact through the training of a researcher -- the postdoctoral research assistant (PDRA) employed for three years -- at a very high level. At the completion of the project, the PDRA should be excellently placed for an academic career in mathematics, or possibly in an area closer to computer science (e.g. finite model theory), and the general research training and development of wider skills will also support a successful future career in industry. The University of Leeds is wholely committed to such training, e.g. through career mentoring and the provision of general courses appropriate for early career researchers, and the PI is also committed to maximising the career benefit of the appointment to the PDRA. The activity generated by the project will have wider benefit to other PhD students in model theory in Leeds, through additional seminar activity and the presence of the Visiting Researchers. Society as a whole can only benefit from high level and broad scientific training of this kind. 

Beyond the above benefits through training, non-academic impact of the project is very hard to predict, but the project team will energetically pursue potential impact. This could arise through research on asymptotics of definable sets in finite structures (e.g. graphs), or through applications to expander graphs, a subject of high current interest. (Such graphs have extremely varied computational applications, and previous work by Hrushosvki and Pillay, related to the project, has been used by Lubotzky to obtain new constructions of explicit families of expander graphs from finite simple groups.) The PI has also recently worked on Vapnik-Chervonenkis density in model theory. This is an invariant of families of sets which refines Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a central concept in statistical learning theory, and there is a potential that the project will lead to new work on VC families in finitary settings, with further applications. In another direction, there is a tentative possibility that work around the model theory of finite fields (with extra structure) will have significance for cryptography.

Richard Elwes, a Visiting Fellow at the University of Leeds and former PhD student of the PI, will have some involvement in the project, at least at the level of seminar participation, possibly through formal collaboration. Elwes has embarked on a career in writing about mathematics, and has written a series of recent popular mathematics books, and articles in New Scientist about topical mathematical issues. His connection to the project will reinforce his writing, partly by giving him close access to current research with links to a range of topical subjects, but more generally since the process of writing about mathematics can only benefit from continued personal experience of the activity of research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>271926</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Workshop `Model theory of finite and pseudofinite structures'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>47374F74-1685-486B-8127-E97E225A07F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a research workshop aimed particularly at younger researchers (PhD students and postdocs) but also with some senior researchers, from a range of research areas, primarily researchers in the general area of the project.

In `Profinite groups with NIP theory and p-adic analytic groups' (BLMS) Macpherson and Tent (Visiting Researcher) achieved Objective 3a, showing, among other results, that a profinite group G, enriched so that its open subgroups are uniformly definable, has NIP theory if and only if it has NTP2 theory if and only if it is virtually a direct product of finitely many compact p-adic analytic groups. 
2. In his 2016 PhD thesis at the University of Leeds under Macpherson's supervision, Bello Aguirre answered Objective 3(b) completely describing neostability possibilities for ultraproducts of finite residue rings (supersimple not NIP, NIP not simple, NTP2 not simple or NIP, not NTP2. He also showed that in the supersimple case the ring is an ultraproduct of a `multi-dimensional asymptotic class' (mac). One paper has been accepted in Archive for Mathematical Logic, another in preparation.
3. The core findings of the project form a large body of work around Objective 1. In `Pseudofinite structures and simplicity', Garcia, Macpherson and Steinhorn (Visiting Researcher) give a strong answer to Objective 1b, initiating generalisation of asymptotic classes, linking to Hrushovski's quasifinite dimension, finding conditions guaranteeing stability-like properties of ultraproducts, linking to Tao's Algebraic Regularity Lemma and word maps (Objective 2). In work in preparation, Anscombe (PDRA), Macpherson, Steinhorn, Wolf (PhD student of Macpherson) have defined macs and generalised measurable structures (it took effort to find the right definition) and an analogue
(mecs) where the estimates are exact, and developed the general theory, also in Wolf's 2016 PhD thesis. They have many interesting examples of macs, eg finite dim vector spaces with a bilinear form over a finite field (2 sorts), finite modules of path algebras of quivers of finite representation type, over a finite field (sorts for field, algebra, module). Wolf showed that for fixed d, finite structures with at most d orbits on quadruples form a mec. Finite graphs (or relational structures) of bounded degree form a mec, as do finite abelian groups, any mec of finite groups consists of soluble-by-bounded groups, and we have a conjecture, with partial results, on when a homogeneous structure is approximated by a mec. Anscombe has further results (manuscript in preparation) showing that `free' homogeneous structures are generalised measurable, and Harrison-Shermoen (PDRA in year 3) and Macpherson have a paper near completion on a notion of `embedded' m.a.c.
4. As part of his Career Development as PDRA, Anscombe continued research related to his thesis on model theory of valued fields. He and Fehm have two major papers in excellent journals. One (in Algebra and Number Theory) proves an existential version of the Ax-Kochen-Ershov principle, and thereby an unconditional proof of the decidability of the existential theory of F_p((T)). The other (PLMS to appear) gives a uniform characterisation in terms of the residue field of when, for a henselian valued field, the valuation ring or maximal ideal is existentially definable, thereby generalising all known results, and obtaining extra uniformity results. He has one other related published paper and two submitted.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>All the key findings are likely to lead to further research by others. As examples, D'Aquino and Macintyre have current research closely related to Key Finding (2).
Aspects of the work on Key finding (3) are likely to be followed up in several directions, by researchers in model theory, combinatorics (eg our conjecture on homogeneous structures as limits of mecs), conceivably representation theory (our result on quivers), and group theory. There are also possible links to algorithms and computational complexity -- for example with our result that finite graphs of bounded degree form a mec. Anscombe's results around Hilbert's 10th Problem concern questions of wide current interest on the number theory/logic border, are published in excellent journals, and likely to be followed up.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D84CC219-8F7B-41B6-9E95-1D02BF4F0486</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A613925C-F787-492A-8913-57735FEAFDDE"><gtr:id>A613925C-F787-492A-8913-57735FEAFDDE</gtr:id><gtr:title>REDUCTS OF STRUCTURES AND MAXIMAL-CLOSED PERMUTATION GROUPS</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of Symbolic Logic</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/16b03fea05c8798d5e1e87d4af7a4e0f"><gtr:id>16b03fea05c8798d5e1e87d4af7a4e0f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>BODIRSKY M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E2CD3029-4481-4BC9-B30E-E4D11F840378"><gtr:id>E2CD3029-4481-4BC9-B30E-E4D11F840378</gtr:id><gtr:title>The existential theory of equicharacteristic henselian valued fields</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Algebra &amp; Number Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/255793bf837a0c4ce644f3d7695ba525"><gtr:id>255793bf837a0c4ce644f3d7695ba525</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Anscombe S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0687C7C3-AFEC-4AAF-93C8-BD5FA77B7BF5"><gtr:id>0687C7C3-AFEC-4AAF-93C8-BD5FA77B7BF5</gtr:id><gtr:title>NOTES ON EXTREMAL AND TAME VALUED FIELDS</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of Symbolic Logic</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2785d28efd13ae5cc2d711c267fee5eb"><gtr:id>2785d28efd13ae5cc2d711c267fee5eb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>ANSCOMBE S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/79BE38AE-7F85-48B7-B561-02171FD3B7C0"><gtr:id>79BE38AE-7F85-48B7-B561-02171FD3B7C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Model theory of finite and pseudofinite groups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Archive for Mathematical Logic</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fe17864a886bdf2fd517bfcb3788f828"><gtr:id>fe17864a886bdf2fd517bfcb3788f828</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Macpherson, H.D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5CF38BFC-C6CE-40A7-9EA5-EFB49B0AF4F6"><gtr:id>5CF38BFC-C6CE-40A7-9EA5-EFB49B0AF4F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pseudofinite structures and simplicity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Mathematical Logic</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7804fef6669da1175b0e3ab2b3a31d9c"><gtr:id>7804fef6669da1175b0e3ab2b3a31d9c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Garc?a D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D5B9996B-FE5A-4125-89C2-4FE8ED824554"><gtr:id>D5B9996B-FE5A-4125-89C2-4FE8ED824554</gtr:id><gtr:title>Profinite groups with NIP theory and
