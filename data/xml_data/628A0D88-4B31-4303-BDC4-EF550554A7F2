(abbreviated to 'Challenging liquid place') brings together two research teams - Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London, and Aberystwyth University - and three community arts project partner organisations: Half Moon Young People's Theatre, London; Oldham Theatre Workshop (OTW); Cyrff Ystwyth, Aberystwyth. Using recently devised performance practices with each organisation, the research asks to what extent contemporary theories of dislocation and transience are evidenced in particular 'real world' contexts, how performance practices can be used to consider relationships to place and how dislocation can be eased through such practices. The projects will stimulate theorisation together with 'best practice' models for further dissemination as material for facilitation in community arts organisations.\n\nTraditionally, 'place' is associated with longevity, continuity, community, the normative and security - as well as boundaries, defence and exclusion. In contrast, contemporary existence is more frequently described as place-less, characterised by transience, wayfaring and deterritorialisation. This project makes use of current academic thinking about place, mobility, globalisation and cosmopolitanism while also raising questions about how we define and experience place and 'dislocation'. In real social contexts, there is wide variation and the situation is hugely complex: whilst deterritorialism has led to geographical dislocations, with all the concerns and problems that displacement can imply, other people may experience place very differently. \n\nThe research comprises three stages, each of a year's duration. First, three participatory performance-related research projects will be developed and refined. The research teams will work with project partner organisations (all of whom have established reputations in community drama) to create place-based projects that use models of performance practice previously derived within research environments. The community groups comprise newly located refugee families (with OTW), unemployed predominantly second generation translocated migrants (with Half Moon) and learning and physically disabled adults who do not have mobility of place (Cyrff Ystwyth). The choice of the three organisations offers a diversity of location, target community group and form of practice. While all the participating groups might be described as socially vulnerable, most importantly they have been selected as demonstrating different relationships to place. \n\nIn Year 2, a range of performance manifestations will take place. Forms of performance will include fully realised devised performance, a workshop series and short residencies. The researchers will provide guidance, 'training', oversight and evaluation as well as some hands-on facilitation. The focus is the participants' response to their sense of place and 'locatedness'. The projects will be documented through recorded interviews, questionnaires, film footage and observation notes. This will provide material to judge the effectiveness of the practical research, to prompt refinements of both the models of practice and current theory.\n\nIn Year 3, analysis and organisation of the outcomes of the research will take place. This includes re-forming the models of practice into material for use by other community arts organisations, the completion of three journal articles and a book proposal. The models of practice will be disseminated through an industry-related symposium held at Central with approximately 75 representatives from international and UK community-related organisations. The flexible models of practice will be presented through web-based documents that offer a series of performance-based activities with graphic representations, DVD clips and reflections on appropriate usage. This work will then be made available on dedicated website pages at Central.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Users and beneficiaries of this research are: 1. participants in the project working with the research team and project partners 2. the project partners 3. additional community drama organisations, their own participants and partners such as local authority officers.\n\n1. Community participants in the project will be the primary users. Through undertaking work with arts facilitators the intention is that participants will consider their relationship with their dwelling place. The new refugee families in Oldham face loss, mourning, deep unsettlement, discomfort and prejudiced local people. This project will look specifically at how the past might be reconciled with the present and how, once a place is performed, it could become an environment that is more familiar, comfortable and re-visioned. It is sensed by Half Moon staff that the young adults not in education, employment or training (NEET) who will take part in the Half Moon project perceive themselves as in a position of stagnation and uncertainty in an inner city environment. Many are expected to 'inhabit' dual places: the homeland of their elders together with contemporary, quotidian inner city London. This research project is expected to enhance the quality of life and creative output of these users with a particular emphasis on understanding place as a site of fusion. The members of Cyrff Ystwyth have lived and worked together for over twenty years in rural west Wales. As CI Ames says of them: 'They are overly located and defined in terms of community and disability' because their disabilities limit their ability to move away. But, she suggests, they are dislocated in other ways: from the centres of power, from art, from a normative aesthetic. One of the aims of the work with Cyrff Ystwyth will therefore be to open up responses to long-inhabited, embedded place through physical performance, whilst simultaneously enquiring into less obvious perceptions of dislocations. \n\n2. Project Partners comprise the staff and artists of OTW, Half Moon and Cyrff Ystwyth. These partners will benefit from developing new performance practices for realisation in community contexts, from participating in discussions about theoretical interpretations of place and from the findings of the research in which their work will be strongly represented and used as 'best practice' for further organisations. It is anticipated that the evaluation of the impact of the research will be of particular use when planning further projects. (See Impact Plan for further details.)\n\n3. With an increasing focus on understanding how we inhabit places 'successfully' (see Case for Support), this research could benefit many hundreds or even thousands in the long term. The dissemination of the research includes a symposium for around 75 community arts organisations where the results of the research will be presented. This will comprise, specifically, the launch of the webpages where the facilitation 'pack' will be placed; this will be the result of the remodelled practices from the three community projects. Central has excellent relationships with its industries. 80 undergraduate and postgraduate students a year undertake placements in community theatre settings and Central's outreach work has attracted Leverhulme Trust funding. Together with Aberystwyth University, we fully expect to disseminate this work very effectively to the current and future practitioners in community theatre settings. \n\nPlease see Impact Plan for further details.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>136882</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>8 months of first fortnightly and then weekly workshops with refugees and asylum seekers have taken place as stages in the PaR project at Oldham Theatre Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:id>70CBA486-C7CE-47CC-9061-46FD3487403E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In Greater Manchester, England, the project worked with the local authority and Oldham Theatre Workshop to address potential feelings of dislocation and enhance adaptations to local place.

The exercises or activities are offered as a structured approach to working on a place-related project or as a set of practices which can be drawn on individually or in combination to address issues of place within the context of workshops, lessons or other similar contexts.

'About Performing Places' (a page within the website) offers background through focusing on the theory which underpins the work and the people who have been part of this project. It also suggests navigation routes through the site as a whole and is therefore a good place to start.

'Place Practices' is the main section of the site, offering examples of work carried out with community groups in the three linked projects.

'Other Places' offers links to examples of additional work in this field.

This website is for arts practitioners devising work around 'place' with community groups. It uses three linked projects as examples of practice (Half Moon Theatre, Cyrff Ystwyth, Oldham Theatre Workshop). These were at the heart of a three year research project looking at how performance-related practices can affect people's responses to their locations.

How innovative research into personal experiences can help the EU address intra mobility and third country migration, London Higher Europe, Brussels, Belgium, February.

This event brought together policy, research and practice in migration studies with a particular focus on understanding the social context of migration and migrants, at home, on their journey and in their new countries.

The agenda set out for the session was:
How can academic research help policy makers frame the best policies to manage the emerging reality of internal and external migration across the EU? This event brings together policy, research and practice in migration studies with a particular focus on understanding the social context of migration and migrants, both at home and in their new countries, as it pertains to young people and the non-migrants who now find themselves at the very heart of the immigration debate. It poses the question: how can we use what we have learned from past and current migrations to craft effective but fair social policy to better manage the current process of migration and ease integration for both the migrant population and their host countries?

I was an invited speaker.

Fellow speakers on the panels were:
Professor Ravinder Barn, Centre for Criminology and Sociology, Royal Holloway, University of London
Professor Ann Phoenix, Thomas Coram Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education, University of London
Thomas Huddleston, Programme Director Migration and Integration, Migration Policy Group
Professor Nira Yuval-Davis, Director, the Centre for Research on Migration, Refugees and Belonging, University of East London
Professor Sally Mackey, Chair of Applied Theatre and Performance, Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London
Domenico Rossetti di Valdalbero, Principal Administrator, Commission, DG Research, European Commission
Second panel chaired by Ana Feder, Policy Advisor, Migration &amp;amp; Integration, EUROCITIES

The event provoked a range of discussion about the impact of research on practices and policies on migration and how Horizon 2020 might be influenced by current research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.londonhigher.eu/site/agenda/border-stories-from-there-to-here-how-innovative-research-into-personal-experiences-can-help-the-eu-address-intra-eu-mobility-and-third-country-migration</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper for Psi conference, 'Two Aberystwyths', University of Leeds</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D3E59963-93BB-4120-805D-B9EB057D03B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A paper reflecting on the project work done in Aberystwyth as part of a panel with Gerry Harris and Roberta Mock entitled: 'Dis-connected communities?

Findings were used to:
i) Encourage the forging of new friendships that surfaced new understandings of Oldham for both 'locals' and 'migrants'. Forging partnerships with local services, like the library and lifelong learning centre, was key to engaging these participants and the project sharings provoked transitional pathways between 'places' through culture.

ii) Make the 'everyday' into 'extra-ordinary' performance art. Half Moon Theatre's senior youth theatre group took their daily routines as exploratory material and performed this to create and exaggerate a new environment according to contemporary humour and place interaction. This was shared in two production showings.

iii) Cyrff Ystwyth, Aberystwyth: This project was led by Margaret Ames and Mike Pearson worked with this project. Participants in the project were members of Cyrff Ystwyth, some of them longstanding members who created responsive performances that surfaced textured identities in response to concepts of the 'rural' and 'local'. 

The Performing Places website has offered 'Place' exercises that were introduced and explained to an audience of more than 75 people during the Performing Places Symposium held on 9 October 2014 at The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. 

The website is a comprehensive facilitation pack with exercises that are clearly illustrated with the help of video clips, lesson plans and annotated comments for external use.

Practitioners who attended the Performing Places symposium found this website very useful and some have directed practitioner colleagues and students to this website. The Performing Places website, and its speakers, have been quoted in blogs towards A New Direction's work on Place (Judge 2014), and ongoing PhD Research for the Understanding Everyday Participation - Articulating Cultural Values (UEP) project' (Webber 2014a; Webber 2014b).

Speakers at Performing Places have also: 

i) recommended the Performing Places website to postgraduate students, urban performance artists and early career researchers interested in architecture, urban planning and literature about 'the city'.

ii) used exercises from Performing Places website in work with recovering substance abusers, to open up reflection, aid situational awareness in recovery and encourage mindfulness. 

iii) cited Performing Places website practices in peer-reviewed articles for Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance (20th Anniversary issue in 2015 and a forthcoming article in April 2016).

Challenging Place asked whether performance-related practices could ease or enhance personal feelings about local place. In an age of unwelcome rootedness as well as extensive movement and dislocation, it was found that such active engagement can make a difference to people's lives.

Place-related practice is a large and growing field with potential applications in applied theatre, environmental studies. 

A new book series, Performing Landscapes, is being put together. This will be published by Palgrave Macmillan. With its unique focus on particular and singular sites, Performing Landscapes will develop in novel ways the debates concerning performance's multiple relations to environment, ecology and global concerns.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The website (one output from the research project) can operate as a resource for a range of applied practices engaging with place. The exercises or activities are offered as a structured approach to working on a place-related project or as a set of practices which can be drawn on individually or in combination to address issues of place within the context of workshops, lessons or other similar contexts.

'About Performing Places' offers background through focusing on the theory which underpins the work and the people who have been part of this project. It also suggests navigation routes through the site as a whole and is therefore a good place to start explorations in using Place related work if one is considering site-responsive practices with communities.

'Place Practices' is the main section of the site, offering examples of work carried out with community groups in the three linked projects. The video clips here augment the description of workshops and exercises in the 'Outline of Place Practices' facilitation pack.

'Other Places' offers links to examples of additional work in this field. Each contributor has highlighted the place-related interventions made, providing inspiration to other practitioners.

The range of published outcomes and engagement activities have - and are expected to continue to - inspire discussions and debates.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4249351C-E4C6-476A-94CD-4B8456E6A37C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.performingplaces.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This website is for arts practitioners devising work around 'place' with community groups.
