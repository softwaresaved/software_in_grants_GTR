The purpose of this research is to contribute new knowledge of the complex interface between policy intentions and educational practices and outcomes through a comparative analysis of the ways in which the intended outcomes of such reforms are mediated and enacted by school leaders and teachers in a diverse range of effective and improving secondary schools in England and Hong Kong.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will begin with a mapping exercise of perceived challenges of current government reforms in Hong Kong and England and a secondary analysis of two existing national surveys on senior and middle leaders' perceptions of their principals' contribution to change and improvement in their schools. These analyses will inform case studies of eight successful secondary schools (four in each country) across diversified school populations in different socio-economic contexts. Pupil surveys will also be conducted to explore their views on the impact of changes (or no change) in their schools and classrooms on their motivation to learn and achieve. The research will make a distinctive contribution to knowledge of how mandated reforms are enacted in schools for the improvement of pupil outcomes. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will generate new understandings about how schools mediate mandated models of systemic change, and through these, have potentially positive benefits for end users in policy and practice communities in the following ways: 

i) For government officials and non-government public bodies, quangos and schools in England and Hong Kong in terms of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of current models of and strategies for systemic change at school level; 

ii) For school leaders in terms of increasing their knowledge of new strategies and skills through which they can mediate reforms and reform intentions in ways which result in context sensitive sustained successful change;

iii) For classroom teachers in terms of support for acquiring new skills in teaching and learning which will improve pupil achievement;

iv) Given both the distinctive focus of the research and the use of a mixed methods methodology that entails in-depth complementary qualitative and quantitative analyses, it will have the ability to have a direct impact on academic communities in education and other disciplines, particularly in adding a new dimension to current understandings of and ways of designing research into the ways schools mediate centrally driven reforms;

v) We anticipate, also, that the research findings will be of value to international NGOs such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which may use the outcomes of our research to inform their cross country evaluation work on the design and evaluation of the ways in which systemic reform intentions are realised in practice.


To ensure access and increase the likelihood of beneficial impacts we plan to disseminate the research widely to different educational stakeholders:

i) to the academic community via publications in internationally recognised and widely read journals (as detailed above in the section on Academic Beneficiaries); 
ii) through a series of workshops specifically designed to attract interdisciplinary participants from within academia along with professionals from local and national government, non-government quangos, think-tanks, and where possible international institutions. 
iii) by a web based 'School Forum'. This will not only permit ease of interaction with researchers based in different parts of the world, but also attract members of the policy community, interested members of the school community and public, and media to access and discuss the progress of our research. The forum will be available for open access through the websites of the respective universities. Each participant in the research will be invited to upload comments and contribute actively to the research process.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77129</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Association of School and College Leaders Annual Conference 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8946D75B-DF77-4B58-BB3F-BD94C85FAF23</gtr:id><gtr:impact>20+ executive headteachers and headteachers of secondary teaching schools attended the workshop on the role of teaching schools in the policy landscape of self-improving system in England.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>symposium at the European Educational Research Association Annual Conference, Dublin, 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B76CF5D6-DEE0-49BC-9622-86E181E408E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 100 people attended our symposium entitled 'Leadership and Policy in Schools: How School Leaders Enact Government Policies for Improvement'.

Using rich illustrations from a diverse range of effective and improving secondary schools in Australia, Hong Kong, Sweden, the UK and the USA, this symposium discussed how school leaders, especially principals, play a key role in successfully steering their schools through changing social and policy landscapes; in providing optimal conditions, structures and cultures for learning and teaching; in enabling teachers to respond positively to the unavoidable uncertainties inherent in their everyday professional lives; and through this, sustain their commitment, wellbeing and effectiveness in making a difference to the learning, achievement and life chances of children and young people. The symposium sparked questions and discussion afterwards.

User community 

1. An invitational national end-of-project seminar successfully brought together 30 experts from the academic community and school leaders, teachers and representatives from the government agencies and engaged them in a debate about issues related to policy, leadership and improvement in schools. 

2. Following an initial discussion and agreement with the Hong Kong Education Bureau (EDB) in July 2014, the Hong Kong team will discuss the potential impact of the research knowledge on school leadership and improvement with middle-rank EDB officials in detail in July 2015. This provides a good example of how the team is using the research to influence policy makers.

3. Knowledge of how effective school leaders use national policies as opportunities for school improvement has become an integral part of the MA in Educational Leadership and Management programme at the University of Nottingham and two postgraduate leadership programmes at the Hong Kong Institute of Education. Over the last two years, these programmes have influenced 100+ senior and middle leaders from schools in England, Hong Kong and internationally.

4. The research findings have been presented at regional and national school leadership conferences and workshops to influence the thinking and practice of school senior and middle leaders. A system leader conference in the East Midlands region of England alone involved more than 300 leaders. 

5. The Hong Kong team took the advantage of their participation in the 17th TALIS Board of Participating Countries Meeting 27-28 Nov, 2014 to share the research findings with the OECD researchers. One particular focus was the role of school leaders in using mandated and non-mandated policies to promote teacher professionalism and professional learning. The research knowledge that emerged from the project was regarded as insightful and enhanced their understanding of the performance of Hong Kong in PISA. 

6. Outcomes from the project have been made available on a web-based forum for members of the school community to access. We are in the process of encouraging wider participation in the School Forum by using it specifically as a resource of postgraduate students and senior school leaders. Over time, we will build up the resources to disseminate case summaries and other materials that can be used for educational purposes and policy discourse. http://hkukeducatoinalpractice.net; https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/education/research/crelm/projects/reshaping-educational-practice/index.aspx . 

7. The pathway that has the most effective, direct impact on the practice and performance of schools has been through working closely with school leaders to enact and embed the knowledge that we have gained from the project, including using various professional networks and partnerships. For example,

a. As governors of local schools and directors of federations and multi-academy trusts, members of the England team have played an important role in encouraging, guiding and supporting headteachers in capturing and participating in a number of national policy and funding opportunities (e.g. those associated with the teaching school initiative) and importantly, to use the additional resources to build leadership capacity for improvement. Since 2016 Professor Gu has been leading two research projects investigating and evaluating school-based innovation programmes and systemic change. Both projects provide formative feedback to the implementation of nation wide education policies.

b. A local school in which we applied the research evidence and knowledge to challenge and develop their senior leadership team over the last year received a 'Good' Ofsted rating - an improvement from 'Requires Improvement'.

c. The Association of School and College Leadership (ASCL) has invited us to contribute two research summaries on leadership and educational change from this project between October 2016 and Feb 2017.

In sum, the knowledge gained from this research has been widely disseminated and enacted in the context of use to influence the work of various stakeholders in the education system in England and Hong Kong. 

Academic community

8. To date, the research team has communicated findings to the academic community through participation in a series of major national and international conferences, including symposia at the European Educational Research Association (EERA) annual conference in 2014 and 2016, the British Educational Research Conference (BERA) in 2014, and the American Educational Research Association (AERA) annual conferences in 2014 and 2015.

9. Research findings will be published in a special issue of Policy and Leadership in Schools in 2017 (vol. 16, issue 4) and in book form with Routledge in 2017. A journal article has been published in Education Administration Quarterly, a high impact international journal on school leadership.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA66E550-16E9-4EE6-9D22-2290DD48751C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project investigated how 'successful' secondary school principals in England and Hong Kong -leading schools in different socioeconomic contexts - enact government policies.

In the research, &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; defined as those schools that had shown sustained improvement in student academic outcomes over time (measured by pupil progress and attainment outcomes between 2003 and 2012) and as measured by national inspection results. The research identified principles and practices of effective leadership and educational practice in these schools and classrooms in the context of externally generated reforms; and through these, extend knowledge of how some school leaders and teachers are able to successfully maintain the broad educational purposes of learning and teaching in their schools and classrooms in times of change and reform. 

We identified four key findings.

Key Finding 1: Policy enactment is not the primary focus of successful principals' work. It is part of, not an addition to, their own purposes and processes of school improvement.

In successful schools in our research, policies are conceptualised as 'opportunities' and resources that leaders weave into the processes of school improvement to ensure that the policies serve their longer term, broad educational values. This is in contrast to Ball et al.'s (2011) findings in so-called, 'normal' schools. 

Key Finding 2: Sustained school improvement is built through the synergistic effects of the combination and accumulation of a number of leadership strategies that are related to the principals' judgements about what works in their particular school context.

Using structural equation modelling to analyse surveys of successful principals and their senior and middle leaders, complemented by case studies, the research provides new empirical evidence of how successful principals directly and indirectly promote improvement over time through tailoring their leadership strategies to their particular school contexts and to the improvement trajectories of their schools. The combinations and accumulations of these strategies are 'layered' within and across school development phases through which improvements in the school's work, culture and achievements are progressively embedded. 

Key Finding 3: Successful schools are driven by shared educational values and standards. Strategically mediating, integrating and embedding policies in ways that secure consistency and coherence with these values and standards is the key.

The connections made by successful school leaders between their values and how they position themselves (and their organisation) in relation to external policy are in contrast to the observation in so-called 'normal' schools where &amp;quot;there is a dearth of values-talk in our data&amp;quot; (Ball et al., 2012: 10). Related to this is that we also found a high level of consistency in perceptions of what constitutes of and contributes to quality and improvement between principals and their senior and middle leaders. 

Key Finding 4: Successful principals express their educational values and monitor standards through values-aligned staffing structures.

Successful principals in our research re-designed systems and staffing structures in correspondence with the values that direct their schools' improvement agenda. They create new roles and responsibilities, building high performance middle and senior leadership with high levels of responsibility and clear lines of accountability.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We organised an end-of-project testing seminar in England and Hong Kong involving experts from the academic community alongside school leaders and teachers from the case study schools and government agencies. We have also presented key findings in forms of papers and symposiums at key national and international academic conferences. These dissemination events have enabled us to verify the authority of the research findings and also provided us with evidence to envisage how our research outcomes might be taken forward:

1) By academics: Our research has provided sound evidence to the academic community which suggests that more educational research needs to focus on successful schools and their leaders that do the right thing and do it right within the international contexts of 'high stakes' testing environments. 

2) By teachers, school leaders and their professional associations: The research- informed examples and accounts of how government reforms (mandatory and non-mandatory) are received and mediated by principals, senior and middle leaders in improved and effective schools serving communities of contrasting socio-economic advantage will be of direct relevance to the daily work of many schools and their leaders and teachers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0614F8EF-7962-44B5-9F6D-843E964E2BDD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/education/research/crsc/researchprojects/reshaping-educational-practice/index.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>A Director of a multi-academy trust</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>846FE5ED-2C9E-4829-A6A7-22DA211297E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a Director of a multi-academy trust, I am accountable to the performance of 9 primary schools in the Trust.
