In the cultural realm, pluralism raises issues about value and values: whether we critically embrace plural value systems, or merely uncritically and almost unconsciously accept them; or whether we assume that some value systems are more valid and even intrinsically 'better' than others.\n\nIn terms of art, the distinguished historian Benjamin Buchloh recently wrote: 'One response to [the] new historical conditions governing the art world... has been to embrace the principle of a totally noncommitted pluralism. It is not even clear whether that principle originated in political conviction or whether this default position simply resulted from both indifference and de-differentiation (of criteria, of judgment, of a commitment to history or anything whatsoever).' (Artforum, 2005). Throughout his career, the critic and theorist Lawrence Alloway was very aware of the inadequacy and danger of this type of pluralism, arguing that 'A criterion of diversity, cued by the production of art as a whole, is not the same as tolerance or goodwill on a basis of indifference.' (Art in America, 1977)\n\nIn order to avoid an art world in which everything, on the one hand, is passively and uncritically accepted or, as it had under Clement Greenberg's influence, was made to conform to a single set of criteria, Alloway argued that\n'...a real pluralist aesthetics would have to relinquish pyramidal and stratified forms of order to allow multiple possibilities and real oppositions of direction within the general field of art.... A pluralist aesthetics, which allows for irreconcilable differences of taste between people, for multiple possibilities within an individual's choices... is demanded by the pattern of the communications network in which we all experience art today.' (Canadian Art, 1966)\nPluralism remains a key issue in contemporary art, underlying the surface of many debates and controversies. Its dominant mode is what Buchloh terms the 'liberal-pluralist model' that usually results in a situation of laissez faire and a diminution of critical responsibility. Alloway's understanding of, and approach to, pluralism offers an alternative that was important historically, but which still has great contemporary relevance. \nThe research/book is divided into three parts:\n1) 1949-1961: Continuum\nThis stage was dominated by Alloway's working through of the continuum model of culture during and after the activities of the Independent Group. Pluralism was expressed as a spectrum of diverse, overlapping possibilities rather than as the conventionally ordered hierarchy of certainties. Alloway embedded the model in writings about not only art (primarily), but also movies, graphics, design, interiors, and architecture and the city. \n2) 1962-1971: Abundance\nAlloway argued that critics had to come to terms with a wide range of art practices and values, because prioritising any one tendency was to close down other options and possibilities. Within this pluralist situation, the main task for the critic was to interpret new forms of art, and to develop a critical mode that was founded on a positive acceptance and understanding of abundance. Abundance was a new social condition and value, replacing restraint and scarcity, and art should reflect society. \n3) 1972-1985: Alternatives\nThe Vietnam War had an impact on a significant number of leading artists and critics from the early 1970s, and led to the formation of the Art Workers' Coalition. Alloway was involved in the debates concerning the representation and selection of artists by museums and galleries in terms of gender and ethnicity. However, his greatest influence was as a critic of feminist art.
