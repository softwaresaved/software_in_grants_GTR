This project focuses on the recent protests in Turkey, particularly in Gezi Park in Istanbul. This project examines the aesthetics of protest, in particular, how protestors use social media to communicate their messages to the public and how they attempt to engage the public, politicians and fellow protestors. Protestors have a range of options open to them in order to have their voice heard and increasingly protestors use aesthetics in order to communicate their ideas. This project looks at protest aesthetics, which we consider to be the visual, material, textual and performative elements of protest, such as images, symbols, graffiti, clothes, art, but also to include other elements such as forms of rhetoric, slang, humour, slogans, as well as the choreography of protest actions in public spaces. Through the use of social media, protestors have been able to create an alternative space for people to engage with politics that is more inclusive and participatory than traditional politics. The use of social media allows people to share ideas on protest activity and deliberate with one another in an online environment. What was significant about the protests in Turkey was how images were shared across social media platforms in order to communicate the messages of the protestors, to unite the public and to challenge the unpopular policies of the government which had provoked the protests in the first place. The project will explore how the public and politicians in Turkey interpreted protest aesthetics and if they attached any significance to particular protest aesthetics, and whether these have changed since 2013, particularly in light of the electoral defeat of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the national elections in June 2015.

The recent protests in Turkey are notable because protestors inhabited public spaces in urban areas and used public spaces to communicate their ideas, emotions, and interests to the public in order to foster support and raise political awareness of issues. However, the power of the protestors was strengthened by social media platforms where members of the public, who were sympathetic with the protestors or lived in a different part of the country or beyond, did not have to occupy the same physical public space, but could engage and deliberate with one another through social networking sites and blogs. Social media platforms are increasingly an interactive space which form part of the political world where people can engage with one another and potentially become powerful. Drawing on McGarry's research on marginalised voices in politics and his work on identities and social movements, this research will provide new insights into how protestors come together and make the choices they do.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will benefit diverse groups including: activists/protestors; Studio X gallery; V&amp;amp;A Museum; individuals in the creative arts; the media; policy audiences; the wider public. Activists and protestors will benefit from the project by inputting into the design of the research project including helping to formulate research questions and objectives as well as identifying areas of research which are meaningful to activists. The project's activist reference group has already specified that they are keen to understand how the political aesthetics resonate with the public which we will uncover through the survey and want to comprehend why protestors deploy particular aesthetics and how. Activists and protestors will benefit from the increased attention on Gezi Park protests and benefit from insights into how protest aesthetics are communicated across social media platforms. The website has the potential to act as a resource for teaching and learning about the protests which activists can use to promote their ideas. Studio X gallery will benefit from a high profile exhibition being held in their exhibition space focused on a key event in contemporary Turkish history. The curator of the exhibition at Studio X will build an international profile for his work. V&amp;amp;A Museum will benefit by hosting a seminar to discuss the findings of the project which will feed into the V&amp;amp;A design and protest series providing an international dimension to its work and will benefit the museum-attending public interested in the role of art in protests. The project will benefit curators and artists around the world by contributing to the digital galleries commission and exposing them to a wider audience including to activists and academics which will generate debate concerning the role of creative arts in protest including how protest aesthetics can capture and communicate the meaning of protests around the world. The media will benefit from covering the exhibition. We will issue press releases and invite key news media and current affairs reporters and cultural critics to a press preview to generate interest in the exhibition and simultaneously generate interest in different media outlets. Policy audiences will benefit from the website, blog and research updates which will document and inform visual aesthetics from protest aesthetics from around the world. The wider public will benefit from attending the exhibition in order to understand better how protestors shaped the Gezi Park mobilisation and why particular protest aesthetics were deployed. The website will also act as a learning resource for the public to understand diverse facets of the Gezi Park protests as well as generate understandings of protests around the world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>203086</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of the original proposal we planned to have an exhibition in Istanbul addressing the theme of 'The Aesthetics of Protest'. Our partner was Studio X in Istanbul. Due to the changing political context in Turkey with increasingly authoritarian measures, Studio X were reluctant to get involved as they were concerned about the content of the exhibition. Recently, artists, journalist and academics have been targeted, fired from jobs and arrested. This required a serious rethink about whether the exhibition could proceed. The PI went to Istanbul in September 2016 and met with artists and discussed what could be done. He met with a curator who suggested exploring how artistic communities have responded since the protests in 2013 and the coup attempted in 2016. One response has been the flourishing of collectives and community art projects and we felt this emphasis on community and participation would be important as it is often neglected by mainstream arts and academic endeavours. A new gallery space and partnership has been established with 'Hakta Art' in Istanbul. The exhibition will be a series of 'live' performances on themes of food and neighbourhood. Most significantly, the Istanbul Biennial will take place in September 2017 and our gallery space has been hired for this month. We are in negotiations to include the exhibition as part of the main Istanbul Biennial Programme.</gtr:description><gtr:id>55FEF4EF-A7DD-472D-AA18-64599F1C3F31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None, as yet.

We formulated a rationale/specification to provide guidelines for the production of the digital galleries.

Aesthetics of Protest - Digital Galleries/Films - Specification

The Digital Galleries concept is an important element of the Aesthetics of Protest project. In our bid to the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities Research Council we described them as follows:

Digital galleries: The digital galleries aim to offer a visual and/or audiovisual response to visual data. This innovative methodology draws on theories developed within the field of the academic audiovisual essay, demonstrating the potential additional insights gained from extending the analysis beyond 'textual' analysis of visual data, to incorporate critical responses in other modes than written ones. Artists and digital media practitioners will be invited to respond to data sets or emerging themes of the research project and their work will be curated in the project website. The output can be still or moving digital images. The technical specifications will be set to meet the requirements of the AHRC should the research council wish to showcase some of these image sets or films on their website.

By the end of the project, in December 2017, we will deliver three 'galleries' as a core outcome of the project. The intention is to offer a creative opportunity to those we commission to direct each gallery. The opportunity must advance the ideas developed during the project and help communicate them to a wider public. We hope each opportunity will enhance the experience and profile of those we commission to work with us in collaboration. While each Digital Gallery 'Director' will have autonomy and the full backing of the project team, there are particular benchmarks and milestones that need to be adhered to.

Specification
We require each Digital Gallery to take the form of either a film (less than 30 minutes) and to be accessible on Vimeo. The AHRC define a 'Film' as 'a series of moving images, but the nature of the images is open and unspecified'. Or, we can accept a digital gallery as a set of images that could be delivered in the existing framework produced by the AHRC. (I will be speaking to them directly about this format and its suitability - we may want to produce all the 'galleries' as films on Vimeo)
http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/funding/opportunities/archived-opportunities/rifa-2016/

Synopsis and rationale
Each Digital Gallery/Film needs to be accompanied by a 150 word synopsis.
We require each Director to produce an accompanying text relating to the ideas and the process, this will be published on the AoP website. (2,500 words)

Directors
Each Digital Gallery should be credited to those involved in its making. It should be led by a named individual who is responsible for communications with the AoP co-ordinator.

Fee
The fee for each gallery is &amp;pound;4000 and this should be spent on production and contributors'/director's fees. Details of the payment process will be agreed with the AoP co-ordinator.

Selection, timeframe and delivery
Each prospective Director should prepare a short proposal (500 words) and a selection of indicative images, making the case for their project. This proposal will be discussed by the AoP investigators who will then approve the decision to proceed with each commission.
Work should start on the Gallery/Film in the spring of 2017 with the Director providing brief monthly progress reports to the AoP team. In July the investigators would like a brief presentation of work achieved to date.
Each Digital Gallery should be made available in its completed form by 1 October 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:id>65A24F82-DC59-45D9-BE39-2DA94DFB3E71</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None, as yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Digital Galleries (Rationale)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Advisory Board</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>720244EF-00DF-45CD-B940-91E804AA1E99</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We invited leading academics working on Visual Culture (Prof Gillian Rose) and Social Movements (Prof Clare Saunders) and Social Media (Dr. Dan Mercea) to an Advisory Board meeting in November 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social Movement conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B84338D3-BAB6-49A7-B3AA-00B93EA37D11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Aidan McGarry presented the outline and methodology of the research project at a Social Movement Conference in October 2016 to an audience of academics and activists.

We have collected 
- almost one million tweets using 'geziparki' as a word search in the tweet and separated those tweets which contain images. 
- a database of 750 images which have been coded. 
- a database of 2400 images from Tumblr 
- a database of 490 images from Pinterest. 
- a database of 121 YouTube videos

- The Twitter API was queried using 'Gezi Parki' keyword. The time period defined for this query was between the 27th of May and the end of June 2013. This was the time period wherein Gezi Park was a regularly trending topic on Twitter and the protests were in full swing.
- Gezi Park was chosen as a word as it was an unstructured and hence neutral term. As an unstructured query, the keyword was used in tweets both by pro and anti Gezi activists as well as tweets with factual information. 
- The data collection process was undertaken by a social media monitoring agency which compiled the data into large spreadsheets. The spreadsheets had to be converted into comma-separated value (csv) format. Excel was unable to open these files due to their size. Once the data was reformatted, the spreadsheets were broken down into smaller, more accessible files. Data retrieval operations were performed on these files using Bash, PHP and Python, three programming languages. 
- The operations performed include the separation of tweets into three separate groups: text-only, tweets containing images and tweets containing links to YouTube videos. 
- Once separated, links embedded in media-rich tweets were harvested using two separate scripts. To collect images, Bash was used to download the physical tweets from the Twitter API. Once collected, the images embedded within the downloaded tweets were extracted using a purpose-built PHP script. Duplicates were eliminated. A similar process will be deployed for YouTube videos. 

IMAGES

The images that were related to Gezi Park movement and that were still accessible were downloaded. The images were then imported into Nvivo for Mac 11.4.0 (2065). Qualitative data analysis was done from the existing data, to reach new categories and themes, and to interpret them within a contextual framework. In this process, meaning categories are determined and integrated in different stages of increasing abstraction, so that both commonalities and differences are established using the constant comparative method. The computer software package Nvivo for Mac 11.4.0 (2065) was used to systematically code and analyse the raw data and to develop and integrate the emerging analytic categories and themes. 

The first stage of open coding was used to generate descriptive and summaritive codes for the visual images. These codes will answer questions like where the photo was taken (i.e. location) or the style of the visual image. Later more specific attributes were coded (i.e. the specific place, inside Gezi park). The project team sought to reach consensus during the process of coding. The team members came together and coded a number of images together to develop a common code book. During this process, researchers evaluated the appropriateness of the coded segments of the data and aimed to reach consensus. During these sessions, the research team came up with the most salient categories. For example, the categories that emerged as significant in the relation to the emotions that a visual image evokes, we defined three categories: affection, demand and humour where the affection category also had two sub categories solidarity and other. These categories will later form the basis for the organization of our results. Memos helped interpret both what was obvious in the image and the subtext or what was not obvious / what was hidden, and served to guide the ''naming'' of categories. 'Memo-writing' during the coding helped move the analysis from content reflection to content interpretation and facilitated the process of raising focused codes to conceptual categories, it also enabled communication among the project team.

The project uses qualitative research including visual analysis, interviews and a qualitative survey of the Turkish public. The research is designed to capture the meaning of protest aesthetics, to understand why protestors used particular aesthetics, and to explore how this resonated with fellow protestors, politicians and the public. 

Our methodological tools capture aesthetics that are visual, audio/visual and material expressions which at once communicate a message and constitute the polity through performance. Pushing beyond analyzing images as text (in isolation) the research team will consider the mediated nature of still and moving images and their performative dimension across diverse social media platforms (including Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, Facebook, and YouTube) for protestors as they seek to subvert the monopolies of representations and interpretations and displace authorships and authorities (Alexander 2011). 


The participatory approach involves consulting activists and protestors from the outset -i.e. in co-producing the research questions and aims, and the research team seek to move participatory action research and socially-engaged arts and humanities research approaches more broadly speaking, up the research agenda by exploring its value in a diverse cultural context through reflection on associated methodological challenges and rewards (Banks and Manners 2012). The approach involves working with community partners and individual participants who engage as collaborators rather than being confined to the limited role of 'end users' (cf. Pain et al. 2011). The current political climate in Turkey makes this ambition of the project increasingly challenging. The aim remains nevertheless to be able to work with the activist reference group composed of a number of activists and protestors based in Istanbul and who were involved with the Gezi Park protests, at various stages through out the project. 

The project proceeds in three overlapping stages. At this time in point the team is mainly concerned with stage one, which entails Stage one will gather a wide range of data on the
visual and material culture produced and shared by protestors on key social media platforms suggested by the activist reference group as well as based on existing knowledge of important social media platforms. 

Using hashtags such as #gezipark and relevant keywords, data has been collected from Twitter, pinterest, YouTube and tumblr and a proportion of the visual material has been coded for the purpose of initial scoping (see Research Databases section). Data about Facebook will be collected via participant-led interviews whereby the participant guides the
researcher through their selection of content that is of particular importance to them rather than being guided by what is important to the researcher. This method can be described as a semi structured interview technique that incorporates elements of online participatory observations.

The project employs the data analysis computer software NVivo for the organization and processing of different types of data, including social media data and visual data. With training from an NVivo specialist we seek to use the full capacities of the software to work in a dynamic and collective approach to the diverse types of data we seek to bring together. We are tackling challenges relating to issues such as the size of data sets collected from social media; the diversity in types of visual genres within the data; the polysemous nature of images; and working in two languages (Turkish and English). 

The analysis of the images and videos collected will be analysed using critical discourse analysis to research language use as 'social practice' (Fairclough and Wodak, 1997) intersecting with political practice. Such analysis will be combined with visual analysis (Rose 2012) that attends to the images both as aesthetic and political communication. Analysis will focus on textual and visual rhetoric, formal aspects and composition, frames of reference and intertextuality as well as the participation frameworks and the socialised nature of the media technology in question.

In the next stages selected visual material in this dataset will be used to inform the interviews with protestors and politicians, as well as the public survey. 

Stage two, will comprise semi-structured interviews with 25 protestors, 5 politicians, 5 humanitarian NGOs, 5 journalists in Turkey, mostly, though not exclusively, in Istanbul. We will ensure the anonymity of interviewees who will be selected using input from our activist reference group as well as extant networks and those who participated in protest organisations such as Diren Gezi Park and Taksim Solidarity. The team has begun the recruitment for interviewees and developed interview guides. Given the somewhat volatile political climate in Turkey at the moment it has been decided to move forward on this in a careful and measured approach. There is a partial risk with interviewing activists who protest against the government which we need to continuously assess as we progress stage two. 

Stage three will determine the impact and future implications of the changing aesthetics of protest by gauging the opinion of the public through an online survey, aiming for 300 respondents who will be approached using active Facebook platforms and other social media forums focused on Gezi Park protests. If the aesthetics of protest have evolved
in recent years then it is important to show that these changes have been noticed by wider society. The survey will highlight selected protest aesthetics selected by the activist reference group, interviewees, and identified as of particular interest in stage one, as mentioned above, and then ask if the public recognises and attaches any significance to the protest aesthetics. The survey will comprise of a combination of open ended and closed questions in order to capture attitudes to and familiarity with the social media and other visual communication employed by activists. The survey will be designed to explore public attitudes, perceptions and understandings regarding protest aesthetics.


Data will be generated from the digital galleries to offer a visual and/or audiovisual response to visual data.

The interviews will be processed using the qualitative coding. The interviews will be transcribed and organised using analytic coding, to aid the identification of key themes.Researchers will work through the transcripts and assign thematic coding principles to the respondents' narrative. Through a process of comparing the individually assigned thematic coding dominant themes in the material will be identified and used to determine the focus for further discursive analysis. The responses to the qualitative survey will be analysed by researchers reading each survey response independently then sifting and sorting themes and pre-determined codes. Software available on the surveymonkey.com allows dominant trends and patterns to be filtered, highlighted and compared.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EFD84E1D-FF0B-42DE-A8FC-7BBDFC5EBBA6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NOne as yet as the research has not been published.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Research Methods</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N004779/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A41F90B5-A81F-42AC-908A-49DB7154F85A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art Theory &amp; Aesthetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8BB67751-1AD5-4EE8-9104-089D5F236DDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Digital Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
