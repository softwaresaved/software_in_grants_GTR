In particular, the use of intense magnetic fields has proven to be an invaluable tool in shedding light on novel magnetic, metallic and superconducting materials. Devices based upon such materials have the potential for transformative effects on technology. Although laboratory electromagnets can deliver large fields of up to 1 or 2 tesla, and superconducting magnets can reach up to 20-25 tesla, the most promising materials require significantly larger field strengths for their investigation. This EPSRC grant will enhance the pulsed-magnetic field facility at Oxford in order to achieve fields of up to 70 tesla and for longer durations than currently available. It would also foster the expertise to pursue a programme of pioneering magnet technology development. This would create a unique capability for the UK and allow specialised measurements to be performed by researchers in UK academia and industry that would not otherwise be possible. Furthermore, it would permit these scientists to exploit the scientific opportunities arising from their impressive track record in high field research and advanced materials fabrication.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>(a) Impact on Quantum Materials Research: 
The current UK quantum materials research effort comprises several important strands: magnetism, superconductivity, topological insulators, multiferroics. Ultrahigh magnetic fields can be used in each area to provide unique information and therefore have a transformative impact across the UK programme of investigation of quantum materials discovery. Typical laboratory magnetic fields are frequently insufficient to significantly perturb the large energy gaps or exchange energies in quantum materials. Pulsed magnet technology accesses higher fields and thus is able to (i) close energy gaps, (ii) drive quantum magnets to saturation, (iii) push novel superconductors above their critical fields into the normal state (thereby allowing investigations of the electronic structure and interactions), (iv) overcome the effect of disorder or small sample-size (permitting Fermi surface characterisation in a wider range of novel materials), (v) lift the frustration in low-dimensional magnets and (vi) push electrons beyond the quantum limit. Examples of these approaches may be found in the appendix listing current grants within Oxford and a statement of how the scientific impact of each would be enhanced.

(b) Impact on Chemistry Research: 
Research in high magnetic fields is closely linked to the development of new materials since the study of electronic and magnetic properties of these materials in a magnetic field is often one of the most informative, particularly when embedded in a tight feedback loop encompassing measurement and synthesis. Thus the funding of this Equipment has a high potential for impact in investigations in which novel chemical synthesis plays a leading role, and will increase the scientific impact of, for example, newly synthesised iron-based superconductors, single-molecule magnets (which show exotic magnetization and magnetocaloric behaviour), and metallic molecular networks. The ability to gain rapid access to ultrahigh magnetic fields within the envisaged access structure will allow immediate feedback on the hottest materials and thereby drive the necessary optimisation of desired properties and functionalities.

(c) Impact on Future Deployments of High Field Techniques: 
The Equipment will provide an environment in which longer-term instrumentation development can take place. This includes the integration of high pressure sample enclosures and ultrahigh magnetic fields for structure-property investigations of novel materials. Ceramic and plastic cells will be required in order to survive the high rate-of-change of flux inherent in pulsed magnets. This would create a state-of-the-art extreme sample environment unique within the UK. Furthermore, new pulsed-magnet designs will be built and tested within the enhanced capability with the view to possible future deployment in national facilities.

(d) Impact on Technical Expertise within the UK: 
An additional positive impact of the current strategic equipment bid is the retention of the necessary technical and scientific expertise within the UK to prevent the immediate loss of national capability and allow for future opportunities.

(e) Impact on Early Career Research Community:
Our key users contain a large number of early career researchers, including EPSRC-funded Career Acceleration Fellows and Royal Society URFs. Their early career stage will guarantee the sustained use and long-term impact of the Equipment. Furthermore the ready access to the state-of- the-art capability funded by this bid will positively benefit their scientific output and professional development at a crucial stage in their career.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CC2191A2-81C2-46C9-AA49-74D406458329"><gtr:id>CC2191A2-81C2-46C9-AA49-74D406458329</gtr:id><gtr:title>Robustness of superconductivity to structural disorder inSr0.3(NH2)y(NH3)1-yFe2Se2</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cd0a737f045057f0214409a12e9008c6"><gtr:id>cd0a737f045057f0214409a12e9008c6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Foronda F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1098-0121</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K024582/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
