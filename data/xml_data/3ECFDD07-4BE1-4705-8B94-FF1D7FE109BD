The aim of Born in Bradford is to find out more about the causes of childhood illness by studying children from all cultures and backgrounds as their lives unfold. Mothers joined the study when they were pregnant and we collected information from them and their partners about their health, their families and their social and economic circumstances. We have collected information on their babies' health and development at birth and as they grow up. 

Now the BiB children are in primary school and we would like to ask them and their families some new questions. We plan to collect information from at least 9,000 BiB children at age 7-10 years and their parents (8,500 mothers and 5,000 fathers/partners). We will work with schools in Bradford to ask children and teachers to complete questionnaires. Children will use laptop computers to complete assessments and answer questions about their lives, health and wellbeing We will also ask parents and children to come to a 'BiB bus' or another community location to complete questionnaires and have some measurements. There we will ask families about changes in their social and economic circumstances, and about their health and wellbeing, and we will ask children about their diet and how much exercise they get. We will take blood samples from children and parents, measure their height, weight, body fat and bone density.

This information will be used to understand children's health and wellbeing, how they have changed over time and the causes of differences in childhood health and wellbeing. In particular, we would like to understand the factors that affect: (1) child social and emotional wellbeing; (2) children's cognition; (3) healthy growth in children and heart health in children and adults. 

All information will be confidential. After all identifying information has been removed, we will share information with other researchers throughout the world, creating an international information source for exploring and understanding how health, development and social wellbeing change throughout children's lives in a deprived multi-ethnic population.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal is for a cohort-wide data collection sweep of Born in Bradford (BiB), a prospective pregnancy/birth cohort established to examine how genetic, nutritional, environmental, behavioural and social factors affect health and development during childhood and into adult life, in a deprived multi-ethnic population. We will conduct a full clinic and interview sweep of at least 9,000 BiB children at age 7-10 years (plus school-based neurocognitive assessments) and their parents (8,500 mothers and 5,000 fathers/partners). These newly collected data will be linked with all existing data and provide the first comprehensive follow up of BiB families since recruitment. Our objectives are to investigate: (1) the determinants of child social and emotional wellbeing at age 7-10; (2) the determinants of child cognitive and motor development in childhood; (3) the determinants of healthy growth in children and of adiposity and cardiometabolic health in children and adults. School-based child assessments will include cognitive assessments, a wellbeing questionnaire, and teacher-administered Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Community-based family assessments will include parent questionnaires and physical assessments, parent-administered SDQ, child diet and activity questionnaires and physical assessments. Multivariable regression analyses will be used to address study objectives. Anonymized data will be made widely available to academics, creating an international resource for exploring life course determinants of health, development and social wellbeing in a deprived multi-ethnic population.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our research will have wide impact for a number of key stakeholders. Our key beneficiaries will be national and international researchers, health and education professionals, policy and decision makers and families, and we are experienced in translating our findings into impact. 

Academic impact
Our strength is in the integration of the best social and biomedical science, combined with innovative approaches to data linkage, to understand key drivers of healthy development and a healthy life course. Our future impact will reflect this strong collaborative and integrative approach across disciplines.

The addition of a new wave of data to the current BiB cohort dataset will create a valuable longitudinal dataset, adding biomedical and social data at age 7-10 to baseline data and on-going record linkage. We will facilitate the use of this resource by the wider academic community, both nationally and internationally. We are committed to data open access and to date have processed requests for data from external collaborators for 128 separate studies. 

BiB will continue to contribute to a number of large European and international collaborations, pooling data in order to achieve high quality research with large sample sizes, and comparison of findings with cohorts in other contexts to generate internationally important policy-relevant findings. In the past, collaboration has led to impactful research on environmental pollutants in relation to development, growth and health, and the relationship between maternal socioeconomic position and preterm birth. 

Economic and societal impact
BiB's new wave research will enable us to continue BiB's positive impact on health and wellbeing in Bradford. Our experience to date has shown our ability to engage with local health care providers and policy makers to influence effective health service delivery (see list of impact to date in Annex 4). 

At a societal level, BiB facilitates knowledge and understanding of the factors that shape the wellbeing of children and families in a multicultural city. BiB has attracted considerable media attention and we will continue working with media organisations to disseminate findings widely to the public throughout the project. 

The professionals involved in BiB so far have developed strong ownership and involvement in the study, and catalysed change in the care and services provided as appropriate. We will continue this approach, which will enhance skills for staff working with BiB and continue to improve services provided in Bradford. 

Research from the new wave of data collection will generate findings that are relevant for policy at local, national and international levels. We will continue to work with national and international policy makers and politicians, as described in the Pathways to Impact, to raise awareness of key emerging research issues in relation to the health and wellbeing of children and their families.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2926217</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N024397/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E4AF608A-CDB6-4CE6-AA10-95B3E043E22F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.1  Organisation and delivery of services</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
