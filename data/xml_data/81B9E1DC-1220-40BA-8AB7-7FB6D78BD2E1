Previously there has been no research to support this assertion. This study, a randomised control trial that assessed the impact of providing reusable sanitary pads and puberty education on girls'
school attendance and psychosocial wellbeing outcomes, was the first to investigate this issue. The results of the trial support the hypothesised positive impact of providing sanitary pads or puberty education for girls' school attendance in a developing country context. Though the findings emerged at the end of the research project, and have only recently been disseminated, we are already seeing an increase in coverage of the issue in both media and policy circles. Menstrual Health was not included n the Sustainable Development Goals and in October 2016, the project team convened members of academia, nongovernmental organizations, donor agencies, and practitioners to discuss ways forward. Six core themes emerged as actionable avenues to provide guidance and improve the inclusion of menstrual management on policy agendas of education, health and gender sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:id>69247F70-2D7A-4A80-B566-F095EFD0578C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A randomised control trial (RCT) was conducted to assess the impact of providing sanitary pads and puberty education on school attendance and psychosocial outcomes for adolescent girls in rural Uganda. The project resulted in the following findings:

School attendance
Results of the study support the assertion that the management of menstruation presents a gender-specific barrier to education. The trial found that the provision of education and sanitary pad provision were both effective in improving school attendance in relation to the control group. Analysis of girls at follow-up found that while attendance declined substantially from the baseline for all girls in the study due to high levels of drop-out, those who received no intervention had a 17% greater drop in attendance. Where data was imputed for girls lost to follow-up, this effect was maintained, with a 25% greater drop in attendance for control schools in the worst-case scenario and 5% greater drop in the best case. Results suggest that providing puberty education is almost as effective in improving attendance as providing sanitary pads, suggesting that even in the absence of resources to provide sanitary pads, the inclusion of adequate and gender-sensitive puberty education in the school curriculum could improve attendance and target gender inequalities.

Psychosocial outcomes
The study found that neither the provision of sanitary pads nor puberty education produced significant differences in the psychosocial outcomes of adolescent girls. The reduction in shame and insecurity associated with the provision of sanitary pads in the pilot study was not replicated. Further, validated survey items capturing the psychosocial impacts of menstruation &amp;not;such as shame, insecurity, and self-efficacy are needed.

Effective Menstrual Management extends beyond the provision of sanitary care
The effective and hygienic management of menstruation requires more than knowledge or reusable absorbents. The project did not address needs for adequate latrines, access to water for washing the body and absorbents, access to soap, access to privacy, or methods for disposal. Each of these factors contributes to dignity and enables adequate menstrual management. It is vital to take a holistic view of girls needs and consider how access to other requirements for menstrual management may further contribute to school attendance and their psychosocial wellbeing. 

Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) 
A secondary analysis of survey data was conducted to assess the prevalence of MHM, using the definition developed by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. It found that 90.5% of girls in the sample failed to meet the criteria for adequate MHM (including change frequency, washing, drying practices, and privacy), with no significant difference between those using reusable sanitary pads and those using traditional methods such as cloth. The work demonstrates an urgent need for improved assessment and reporting of MHM, and for primary research that tests the links between menstrual management and health, education, and psychosocial consequences.

Formative Research is Essential
Our findings support the need for RCTs to include a component of formative research to identify factors that may impede the effectiveness of the intervention. Though attrition is a challenge faced in most RCTs, it may be compounded in contexts of poverty, where economic constraints can prevent sustained participation in an intervention. Formative research in this project would have identified the high levels of school drop-out and enabled the development of a-priori analytic strategies to mitigates its effects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We will be holding a scientific meeting at Oxford University in November 2016, which will bring together key international stakeholders engaged in menstrual hygiene management, from both Southern and Northern countries.
