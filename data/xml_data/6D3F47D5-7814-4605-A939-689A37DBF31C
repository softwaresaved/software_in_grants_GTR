My own book (Jugoslavija - drzava koja je odumria, 2003) promotes multi-factored analysis of the reasons for this collapse - which includes both ideology and the role of personalities. I would now like to take a step further by looking at the role that Josip Broz Tito, the central political personality of the 1945-1980 periods played in keeping Yugoslavia together. I would also like to offer a reassessment of &amp;brvbar; Tito's policy and ideology in light of new developments in Yugoslav and post-Yugoslav history and politics. The project examines the role of the Tito factor' (including the 'factor of Titoism' as a political doctrine) in both securing stability of Yugoslavia in the period of 1945 -1980, and - in the post-Tito period - failing to preserve its unity. 
The research will have following specific objectives: 
1. To assess the importance of Tito's personality and his policies for the development and preservation of the Yugoslav state from 1945-1980; 
2. To assess the post-Titoist decade (1980 - 1990) in light of the various attempts to continue or discontinue Tito's political legacy and his political will; 
3. To examine the relationship between the Titoist legacy and the actual collapse of Yugoslavia in 1989-1992; 
4. To analyse official and unofficial representations of Tito and Tito's Yugoslavia in the aftermath of the collapse including official memories (or the lack of them), and any eventual link between the political programs of new post Yugoslav elites and Titoist legacy; L 
5. To offer a reassessment of Tito's legacy from a distance of 25 years since his death; 
6. To enhance our understanding of authoritarian regimes (especially those which developed in Eastern Europe in the Cold--War), and of the role of the leading personalities in these regimes; 
7. To contrute to studies of transition from authoritarian regimes. 

In pursuing these main objectives, the following specific questions will be addressed: 
1. What were the origins of Tito's interpretation of Marxism - and of his political ideology of socialist self-management? 
2. What issues have not yet been properly addressed - related to his accession to power, exercising power, and/or ruling of the country? 
3. How important was Tito for the unity of Yugoslavia - and, consequently, his death for disintegrative processes in Yugoslavia? 
4. What mechanisms did he use to further his political and ideological objectives? 
5. How important was his ethnic background for the policies on the national question he developed for Yugoslavia? 
6. To what extent was he an autocrat - and was he always in position to impose his will to other relevant political participants? 
7. How important for his role domestically was Tito's position in the international arena? 
8. How was the official representation of Tito conceived and was it successful? 
9. To what extent did the new rulers of post-Yugoslav states model themselves as 'new Titos' - or as 'anti-Titos'? 
10. Have any of Tito's ideological and political successes been sustained - and if so, which? 
11. What is the source and explanation of the recent revival of positive images of Tito and Titoism? 
12. How will he and his time be viewed historically?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26276</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E50437X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>32A0976A-B577-4829-A940-9AB6B148F977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area &amp; Development Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
