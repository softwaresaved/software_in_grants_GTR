It comprises a series of linked projects forming a broad consortium of some 40 researchers, drawn across 14 Universities. The research focussed upon a case study area of five local authorities in London, to the south of the River Thames, namely Croydon, Bromley, Lewisham, Greenwich, and Bexley. As a study area, these boroughs comprise the 'South- East London Resilience Zone' (SELRZ). The SELRZ area is of economic significance and part of the strategic London Plan (Mayor of London, 2008), which states that the effects of climate change should be incorporated into the development of the 55,000 additional homes and 100,000 new jobs planned up to 2026. CREW was established to gain a better understanding of the effects of future climate change on extreme weather events and associated hazards, and to develop a range of tools for improving local-community resilience. Previous initiatives, such as the Stern Review (Stern, 2006), had considered high-level socio-economic impacts, but had not addressed sub-regional or local estimates pertinent at the community and individual scale.

The CREW research therefore sought to address the needs of a range of key beneficiaries and stakeholders including: (1) decision makers for community resilience; (2) property owners and householders, insurance companies and the building industry; (3) small to medium sized business enterprises (SMEs) such as housing associations, and (4) the research community.

CREW consequently investigated observed and potential local-level impacts on householders, SMEs and local policy/decision makers from a range of extreme weather-related hazards including flooding, subsidence, heat waves, wind storms and drought. The research has sought to investigate opportunities and limitations for local communities' adaptive capacity, considering the decision making processes across communities and the impediments and drivers of societal change. A web-portal, www.extreme-weather- impacts.net, provides projections of potential hazard occurrence for a range of future scenarios from UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) for the near- to mid-21st century, together with evaluations of coping mechanisms for building design in addressing the adverse effects of heat waves. 
Specifically, CREW has sought to follow an interdisciplinary approach, seeking to:
a) develop and apply new implementations of the UKCP09 weather generator to produce spatially-consistent, high-resolution, catchment and city-scale time series of current and future climate for the SE London Resilience Zone (SELRZ) study area;
b) gain a better understanding of the impacts of EWEs (current and future) on local communities, based on three community group: householders, SMEs and decision makers;
c) integrate social and physical research to develop an improved understanding of risk from EWEs at the community level;
d) study the complex inter-relationships between community groups in order to improve the understanding of risks, vulnerabilities, barriers and drivers that affect the resilience of a local community to extreme weather events;
e) quantify and rank a number of technical and adaptive coping measures for reducing vulnerability to the extreme weather effects of heat waves;
f) develop web-based information dissemination tools for integrating the project outputs. These deliver maps, reports and guidance on impacts and resilience measures for extreme weather.

The CREW research programme has been broad ranging and as such has secured achievements and impacts across many disciplines with over 50 publications and presentations (see Appendix Two) secured together with representations made to several influential committees and agencies. A wide engagement with industry, health practitioners, and policy makers at local, as well as national levels has benefited both the research team and the stakeholders alike.

A key outcome of CREW has been the development of the UKCP09 weather generator approach to produce spatially consistent high-resolution catchment and city-scale simulations of current and future climate for the SELRZ. This work has underpinned the development of a series of hazard models exploring projections for periods centred on the 2020's and 2050's, compared to the current time. This has included, for example, the development of detailed models for pluvial/fluvial flood at the local scale. Soil subsidence models were prepared to show the likely impacts of clay-related subsidence, whilst heat wave models have drawn on land use information as well as other factors to produce future estimates of heat events across London and producing mapped vulnerability and risk indices as outputs. Model simulations for exploring water resource drought have been produced that provide projections of water saving measures, such as the implementation of hosepipe bans, considering the effects of both water supply (climate and hydrology) and demands (population change). UKCP09 climate projections with particular probabilities were used to generate corresponding hazard projections, identified using a range of user-relevant thresholds. A notable achievement has been in how uncertainty in future hazards has been captured and represented to the various stakeholder groups.


The research has facilitated the development of a risk assessment framework for improved community scale decision-making and has led to a greater understanding of the issues faced by SMEs in interpreting extreme weather scenarios and in developing contingency plans to reduce their vulnerability, improving resilience and adaptive capacity. The risk assessment framework developed was supported by technical evidence of coping strategies as well as related field work drawing upon these inputs. The research has allowed for a greater understanding of the issues faced by local policy planners in preparing community level assessment plans for extreme weather events and has further led to a greater understanding of the inter-relationships between households, SMEs and local authority policy makers. For example, we have helped develop the first empirical model to quantify the negative effect that flood risk has on employment, and how this relationship will vary depending on the spatial concentration of employment (Chapter Four). This work has been facilitated through the integration of climate model output with high-resolution hazard models and the portrayal of these outputs utilising a web mapping geographical information system (GIS) interface.

The CREW research has led to a fruitful critical literature review being published concerning the shortcomings in existing theoretical and methodological frameworks as identified when applied to a world characterised by global climate change. This work has further led to the development of a published theoretical framework, grounded in the economic psychology and sociology of risk literatures that draws together the links between risk-adjusted house prices, observed house prices and flood risk, and posits how these relationships are likely to change in the context of climate change. The research has also led to an estimation of the first models of the effect of flood risk on house prices and employment, taking into account feedback effects from and to each sector. We also take into account spatial spill-overs - how changes in house prices and employment in one area can have knock on effects on surrounding areas not directly affected by flood risk.

Considering the development of coping measures for community adaptation, for the first time CREW has offered a systematic and quantitative assessment of passive coping measures for heat waves which will vastly improve building adaptation/retrofit decisions. Taking human factors into consideration, the CREW research has revealed 
the major importance of occupancy for building adaptation design options and has revealed the interaction between mitigation and adaptation - some mitigation measures would undermine adaptation, and vice versa. It has been shown how this could be prevented with minimum cost and disruption where mitigation and adaptation are both considered together.

Lastly, the CREW research programme has allowed the deployment of an interdisciplinary web-based portal designed to integrate information, model results and qualitative information summaries from the research outputs from the other programme packages. Key achievements include not only the use of the web-portal toolkit to represent phenomena indicative of the conditions prevailing under a range of uncertain future climates, but also the successful drawing together of coherent information representing the social sciences, atmospheric sciences, earth sciences, hydrological sciences and engineering disciplines. Use of the web-portal toolkits to support the project's stakeholder engagement activities has also represented an important achievement, where decision makers, SMEs and householders were able to utilise the functionality of the WISP tools to aid communication and understanding, guided by the project facilitator. Further to this, the engagement with user groups in CREW meetings and general assemblies have allowed the researchers to take on board and reflect stakeholder viewpoints. CREW has thus led to the development of 'real-world' tools that communicate effectively the many scientific outputs to affected parties.

Overall, CREW represented an ambitious, interdisciplinary programme of research focussing on the issues of community responses to extreme weather events in the SELRZ study area, coordinated to draw together the inter-disciplinary research undertaken. The research has also produced a transformative template which, looking forward, can now equally be applied in and transferred to other metropolitan regions of the UK to provide guidance in planning for adaptation and community resilience to extreme weather events.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>CREW considered the impacts of extreme weather on communities and small businesses, and the decision making process at this scale. An important element of the research considered geohazard modelling and the consequences of climate change.

One obvious development forwards for the research activity, is to consider the impacts of these changes on the wider built environment and the planning process for the provision of infrastructure.
