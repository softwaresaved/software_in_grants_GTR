We will conduct a detailed investigation and analysis of four contrasting types of chemosynthetically-driven communities, together with their regional tectonic setting. The communities chosen for our investigation comprise: those associated with high-temperature, bare-rock hydrothermal vents (East Scotia Ridge), high-temperature, sediment-hosted hydrothermal activity (Bransfield Strait), mud volcanoes (South Sandwich fore-arc basin) and methane hydrates (north of King George Island). We propose three cruises and subsequent laboratory-based programmes. Cruise 1 will be to the East Scotia Sea where we will examine the tectonic setting and sample the hydrothermal discharge using autonomous underwater vehicles and the hydrothermal sampler BRIDGET. Cruise 2 will be to the same area and will use the UK Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Isis to dive on, sample and characterise the biological and physical environment surrounding vent and seep sites identified during Cruise 1. Cruise 3 will be a combined geophysical, chemical and biological cruise, using the ROV Isis to dive upon and examine hydrothermal and cold seep environments both north and south of King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula. Subsequent analysis will compare the hydrothermal and seep chemistry among these four sites. We will use morphological, molecular, lipid and stable isotope analyses of microbial and metazoan populations to determine the phylogeography of species, and understand the food web processes. Our programme will determine whether colonisation of vents and seeps, in these most isolated of chemosynthetically-driven ecosystems, is driven by oceanographic or tectonic processes or whether any site is, instead, host to completely isolated evolution.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>69665</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Use of deep-sea footage in BBC Natural History Unit documentary series</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91FE5DB4-DFD0-4E20-85F9-F3AD6ED6C403</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Use of deep-sea video footage in BBC Natural History Unit documentary series Atlantic: The Wildest Ocean On Earth, broadcast on BBC in Aug 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02y7dd1</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Southern Ocean: The challenges in managing a unique marine ecosystem.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E2BD05CA-8C1C-4806-AC6F-EC053073EBC8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk describing Antarctic ecosystems, including newly discovered hydrothermal vents, and the importance of their conservation to the public.

? The discovery, sampling and description of the first deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities from the Southern Ocean located on the East Scotia Ridge.

? An analysis of the global biogeography of hydrothermal vents in the light of the newly-discovered Antarctic vent communities, suggesting 11 distinct vent &amp;quot;provinces&amp;quot;.

? Isolation of genetic markers for analysis of connectivity in three key vent species from the East Scotia Ridge and a vent site located in submerged volcanic crater off the South Sandwich Islands. These species were a new species of yeti crab, a peltospiroid gastropod and a vent limpet.

? Identification of high levels of genetic connectivity between populations located on the East Scotia Ridge separated by ~440km but significant genetic differentiation in populations of limpets between the East Scotia Ridge and the volcanic crater. In the latter case limited gene flow is from west to east, consistent with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

? A close phylogenetic relationship (sister species) between yeti crabs and peltospiroid gastropods species pairs located on the East Scotia Ridge and the South West Indian Ridge (Dragon vent field).

? Identification of low genetic connectivity between the Dragon hydrothermal vent field and the Central Indian Ridge vents in the scaly-foot gastropod.

? Discovery and description of a new genus and two new species of peltospiroid gastropods, one from the East Scotia Ridge and one from the Dragon vent field.

? The first phylogenetic tree describing the evolutionary relationships of the yeti crabs (Family Kiwaidae).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We see the use of the results from the CHESSO project having impact in three primary non-academic areas: management of marine mining; marine spatial planning for conservation purposes; education.



Management of marine mining

The refinement of the current understanding of the distribution of the biota endemic to deep-sea hydrothermal vents is relevant in the mining of seabed massive sulphides which are associated with vents. The first deep-sea mining operations targeting these types of deposits will take place within the next few years and it is notable that the Dragon hydrothermal vent field lies within an area licensed for exploration for mining by the State of China. Data gathered and synthesised during CHESSO is of direct relevance to understanding both the direct impacts of future mining operations on biodiversity and also the capacity for recovery via larval recruitment to impacted vent fields. It is notable that poor connectivity amongst Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents, for example, makes the potential for recovery low compared to highly connected vent ecosystems such as those along the East Scotia Ridge or on sections of the East Pacific Rise.



Marine spatial planning for conservation

The South Sandwich Trench and associated islands are unique features in the Southern Ocean. The vent communities found on the East Scotia Ridge and submerged volcanic crater near the South Sandwich Islands are also the only known to date, although other high temperature deep-sea vent ecosystems are likely to exist. It is important that these areas are protected both as a part of the unique biodiversity of UK overseas territories but also in the context of a wider network of protected areas within the Southern Ocean. CHESSO project data has fed directly into decision making on the intiation of protected areas in the waters of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, including direct protection of the submerged crater near the South Sandwich Islands from bottom fishing and the prohibition on bottom fishing deeper than 2,000m. In a wider context the Oxford team has directly communicated the findings of the CHESSO project to colleagues advising governments internationally (i.e. China) and also through CCAMLR and other international for a.



Education

During the CHESSO project the captivating and charismatic nature of the East Scotia Ridge vents and the animals that inhabit them have provided a strong vehicle for education. This has been achieved through a number of activities including:

Presentations to the public and to University and school students

High profile media releases associated with the publication of key papers for the project.

The creation of online teaching resources using materials from the CHESSO project. An example of this is the TED-Wiley-iTunes project (http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-816336.html) which between March and October, 2013, attracted 22,874 views, 5,643 subscriptions, 7,634 downloads and 6,275 streams.

Engagement with artists to produce a major exhibition &amp;quot;For Now We See&amp;quot; for the Invisible Dust Project.

Provision of the opportunity for two D.Phil. students and 4 undergraduates to complete their thesis or project dissertation.
 This information has been or is in the process of being disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals. This is not only the main route of communication to other scientists but is also the gold standard in terms of credibility of the work to non-scientists, including environmental managers and industry stakeholders. The main use of the data is in furthering understanding of the biodiversity of the deep-sea vent biota and also its biogeography, the patterns of distribution of vent species and underlying mechanisms that have driven this overtime. It has also been important in furthering our understanding of the connectivity of vent ecosystems. Both of these areas are of direct relevance to management of deep-ocean resources and the protection of marine biodiversity. The routes to exploitation of these data have been several including:

? Publication of project results in peer-reviewed policy journals (e.g. Marine Policy) and reports targeted at marine conservation and management policy.

? Direct communication of results through workshops, talks at conferences and also public presentations.

? High profile media releases associated with major publications arising from the
