Strawberries account for around 60% of total berry production. The strawberry market is worth c. &amp;pound;450 million based on retail sales, and UK production exceeded 108,000 tonnes in 2012. With annual growth of 10-15% p.a., production in the UK has shown the largest increase in Europe with a rise of 156% in the last ten years. New and improved cultivars and innovative technologies has enabled growers to extend the season of production to at least eight months of the year. This increase has led to a significant reduction in reliance of imported fruit; home production marketed as a percentage of total supply was 66% in 2012 compared to 53% in 2002. However with fresh strawberry imports worth c. &amp;pound;122.8 million, there is still scope to improve self-sufficiency of the UK industry. To do so UK growers will need to adopt new products and embrace new methods to further improve the efficiency of production and season extension. Following the withdrawal of the soil sterilant methyl bromide in 2009, the incidence of soil-borne diseases such as crown rot and Verticillium wilt has increased considerably. Chloropicrin has been adopted as a substitute product, but since this also faces an uncertain future, alternative strategies are being sought. Instead of planting directly in the soil, many growers are now utilising substrate bags to alleviate the risks posed by soil-borne pathogens. Soil-less culture has been growing steadily in recent years and currently around 40% of strawberries produced in the UK are grown using this system. In the last five years peat-based products have been replaced by coir, an arguably more sustainable alternative growing medium. In an effort to advance the sustainable intensification of strawberry production, a commercial-led breeding programme will be intrinsico the future of the industry. Currently most breeding programmes focus on cultivars for soil production but if the adoption of soil-less systems continues to rise, there is a necessity to promote economic sustainability by developing new cultivars that are adapted to substrate production. By improving efficiency, yield and fruit quality through a new generation of innovative technologies it is envisaged that the whole UK soft fruit industry, from grower to consumer will benefit.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>NOT INCLUDED</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The production of more resilient varieties for UK production is key to the continued success of this sector of UK horticulture. By maintaining, or even increasing the degree of self-sufficiency in sustainably grown produce the UK rural economy will be supported. The knock-on health benefits of a more affordable fresh diet will also lead to indirect benefits to the UK. 

Through the development of a belowground imaging system, the R&amp;amp;D capability of UK breeding companies and their ability to translate basic science into practical tools will be enhanced. The opportunity to robustly capture complex trait variation has long been a key challenge in plant breeding and accurate measurement techniques will enhance the output from the two breeding companies in this proposal. Globally, these UK breeders will be in a strong position to capture a large existing market, of which many varieties are currently non-UK bred. This increase in royalty share (of a &amp;pound;1.7 billion market), which will be of key benefit to two UK commercial breeding companies, will allow UK competitive advantage to be maximized. A fuller economic analysis is presented in the TSB case for support and associated appendices. 

The application of genomics approaches to plant breeding is also of key importance if the massive advances in genotyping and genomic technologies is to be realized in a commercial setting. This project will lead the way in showcasing the translation of basic research into practice and through impact generating activities with the largest soft fruit grower cooperative, effective knowledge exchange between end users and academic researchers will be possible. 

Project findings will be communicated through high-impact peer-reviewed papers, communications through the horticultural trade press and by conferences and other outreach activities. Within the consortium, key emphasis has been placed on alerting growers and end users of improved varieties to the economic benefits of more sustainable gowing practices. 

Through the exploitation plan there is the opportunity for multiple future interactions with other research and industry partners which will further cement the UK's international position in larger research collaborations. Enhancement of UK capability in research through extended links across the supply chain is of key importance, as it allows effective KE between industry and academics in this important area. It also brings international expertise directly to UK companies, allowing development of national capabilities, where currently these are lacking.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>447196</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Plant and Animal Genome Conference (San Diego)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E6F6170-CB7A-4FB1-95B8-5F4D27632E55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented a poster on my genetic mapping program at a major international conference.
