&lt;p>The project is due to begin in January 2013 and to be completed early in 2015. It will be based at the Centre for Business Research (CBR) at Cambridge University, and will involve collaboration with Monash University and the International Labour Organisation (ILO), as well as research organisations in the case study countries, namely Cambodia, China, India and South Africa. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The quantitative dimension of the work will take the form of econometric analysis of data on labour laws at national level, alongside relevant economic and labour market indicators (including GDP, employment, unemployment, productivity, and inequality). The qualitative dimension will be based on interview-based fieldwork, with around 40 interviews for each country, so around 160 in total, divided between legal actors, firm-level actors, government officials, and civil society actors.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of the research will include officials of the International Labour Office (ILO) charged with the responsibility for giving technical advice on labour law-related matters to national governments and other parties concerned with the application and operation of labour standards; officials of international financial institutions, in particular the World Bank, who have an interest in the implications of labour law regulation for the nature of the business environment in developing countries; to government officials, particularly in developing economies, interested in the conditions for the effective application of labour law rules; officers of trade unions and employers' organisations, at national, regional and global level, with an interest in the operation of labour law systems; managers in firms concerned with the interaction of labour law rules with other institutional and economic factors in shaping the business environment of developing countries; investors with an interest in understanding the legal, economic and political dimensions of countries in which they are considering making an investment; members of civil society organisations and NGOs involved in poverty alleviation; and the poor in low and middle-income countries, who will be in a position to benefit directly from the more effective implementation of labour law rules aimed at poverty alleviation and wealth redistribution.

In the immediate term, impact will take the form of dissemination of research findings through user workshops in the case study countries and a user conference planned for the summer of 2015, and of the diffusion through ILO and CBR working papers and national and international media outlets. In the medium term, the research has the potential to inform the work of ILO officials who give technical advice on the implementation of labour standards to the governments of ILO member states. The provision of technical advice has been one of the major functions of the ILO since the inter-war period (Bronstein, 2005). In recent years a substantial body of technical advice has been provided to countries at various stages of development, and in particular to low-income countries where difficulties of the transplantation and diffusion of labour law norms are often at their most acute (Fenwick and Vargha, 2011). The ILO recognises the principle that programmes of labour law reform need to be tailored to local country and industry conditions and should be based on a dialogue involving government and the social partners. The development of a robust analytical framework for identifying the conditions under which labour law rules can be made effective and thereby contribute to poverty alleviation will accordingly be of direct interest to the ILO. The ILO commissioned the research by Marshall (2010) and Deakin (2010a) which led to the formulation of the analytical template that will be developed further in the course of the current project. ILO officials have been centrally involved in developing the current project application and will play a major part in the conduct of the research. It is anticipated that the development of the refined template will contribute to operational change in the ILO, in particular in the way that it provides technical advice on labour law reform. 

In the longer term, the research has the potential to address interests of wider concern in the debate over the relationship between labour standards, international trade, and economic and human development. A robust and empirically grounded account of the conditions under which labour laws can be effective in meeting their explicit goals of extending social protection and addressing the needs of some of the poorest and most vulnerable members of society will be of interest to a range of policy makers and government officials, and of practical value to the poor in low and middle income countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>393777</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Report on labour court reform in Vietnam</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA1E68E5-9CC6-4A3C-BADD-C2B18B36DFC2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At the invitation of the Justice Partnership Programme for Vietnam, Simon Deakin prepared a report on labour court reform, drawing on comparative evidence obtained through the funding made available by the DFID ESRC Joint Fund project on which he has been PI.

In 2015-16 the data were made available to the Asian Development Bank for econometric analysis. All the above relationships are ongoing. 

During 2015 the PI used part of the findings in the course of consulting work on labour law reform for the Vietnamese government.

The quantitative dimension of the work took the form of econometric analysis of data on legal and institutional variables. The qualitative dimension of the work consisted of interviews in the case study countries (China, Cambodia, India and South Africa). Interviewees included those with legal knowledge and experience (judges, lawyers, politicians, regulators, civil servants, labour inspectors), private-sector firm-level actors (HR and other managers), and actors in civil society (trade unions, NGOs).

The main contributions of the research were as follows:

(i) The construction of a new dataset coding for changes in labour law in 117 countries over the period 1970 to 2013 (the CBR Labour Regulation Index or 'CBR-LRI'). The wide reach of the dataset and its decades-long time series make it unique in the field. Its nearest equivalent, the OECD's Employment Protection Index, codes for a times series only from the mid-1990s, and does not cover working time or most aspects of collective labour law. The CBR-LRI provides data on for five areas of labour regulation (different forms of employment, working time, dismissal, employee representation, and collective action) using a series of original coding algorithms. All codings are precisely sourced to specific laws or regulations in an methods document which runs to over 800 pages. 

(ii) Use of time-series and panel data econometrics in conjunction with the new dataset to estimate the effects of changes in labour laws on economic outcome variables. Exploratory analysis using the pooled mean group regression model suggests that strengthening worker protection generally increases the labour share of national income (after controlling for GDP growth and for differences in institutional quality as proxied by 'rule of law' indices). Improvements in employee representation and dismissal protection generally have positive effects on productivity and employment. The picture is more mixed for strike law. Overall the research suggests that worker-protective labour laws can contribute to poverty alleviation both directly, through their impact on distribution, and indirectly, through their effects on growth, but that these effects depend on context and may not be present consistently across all countries.

(iii) Qualitative fieldwork on the operation of labour laws in MICs and LICs. The Chinese case suggests that legislatively-mandated labour standards can be successfully implemented if there is effective state capacity, but also illustrates the limits of legal strategies in the context of global value chains. The Cambodian, Chinese and South African fieldwork highlighted the importance of labour arbitration systems for providing unions and workers with low-cost access to justice. The Cambodian case illustrated ways in which legislated standards interacted with monitoring by NGOs. The Indian case illustrated the problems that can arise from political deadlock over labour law reform.

(iv) Methodological advances. The project demonstrated the potential of quantitative approaches to the study of legal institutions ('leximetrics') to generate new knowledge and opportunities for statistical testing of law-economy interactions. It also demonstrated the value of multiple-methods approaches, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The new dataset we created, because of its long time-series and wide country coverage, will be of interest to academic researchers in the fields of economics, development and legal studies, and to research users in international organisations, governments, NGOs and companies, who are interested in the economic impact of labour law reforms. The dataset was used in this way by the ILO in 2015, in an analysis which formed part of ch. 4 of its World Employment and Social Outlook Report for 2015. Also in 2015 the Asian Development Bank commissioned the CBR to prepare data on labour regulation for econometric analysis. During 2016 members of the project team gave presentations to the European Commission and the OECD on aspects of the dataset. The qualitative findings of the research will also be of interest to users involved in labour law research. In 2015 members of the project team prepared a report on labour court reform for the Supreme People's Court of Vietnam and the EU-funded Justice Partnership Programme, drawing on the research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4FCE3AD7-BCC1-4F64-AC94-7C6A0F6A3B04</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cbr.cam.ac.uk/research/research-projects/labour-law-poverty-alleviation-in-low-middle-income-countries/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The CBR-LRI is a new, unique dataset which has been constructed using a version of 'leximetric' methodology which provides a basis for the quantitative analysis of legal rules. The period coded is, in principle, from 1970 to the end of 2013. In the case of post-socialist countries, the relevant period is that following the establishment of a market economy and the legal rules corresponding to it, which in most cases will be from some point in the early 1990s. This date differs across countries depending on the point at which new legal codes or rules were adopted or, in some cases, when a new state came into existence. The coding was done by identifying the provisions of law and relevant court decisions applicable to or answering the description of each of the indicators or variables in the index. Secondary sources, relevant databases of national laws, and the ILO's NATLEX database were consulted. Primary sources were retrieved from texts available in law libraries or online. Wherever possible, texts were consulted in their original language (the languages read in the original were English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish). Where translations of texts were consulted, it was generally possible to find a translation authorised by the government of the country concerned or by an international organisation. The coding algorithm for the CBR-LRI was devised collectively by members of the CBR when the Centre's leximetric coding project was initiated in 2005, and was first reported in Deakin, Lele and Siems (2007). The codings reported in the current (December 2015) version of the dataset were arrived at by a process of iteration involving discussion between the authors of the dataset. In some cases the reported codings draw on advice provided by national experts who were consulted during the coding process. Five areas of labour law are coded, producing five sub-indices. These are: the law governing the definition of the employment relationship and different forms of employment; (including the regulation of the parties' choice of legal form, and the rules relating to part-time, fixed-term and temporary agency work); the law on working time; the law relating to dismissal; the law governing employee representation; and the law relating to collective action.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CBCA2148-CF33-4DB6-A226-B1439F662E21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The dataset was used by the ILO in collaboration with researchers from the CBR in January 2015, leading to work which appeared in the ILO's 2015 World Employment and Social Outlook report.
