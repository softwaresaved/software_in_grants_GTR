These will include a substantial number of objects borrowed from Iran and will rely in part on research done by scholars associated with the National Museum and the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organisation. \n\nA century after Shiism became the official religion of Iran, Shah `Abbas commissioned major restorations at the Ardabil and Mashhad shrines in the early 17th century. Also, he made a substantial charitable gift of manuscripts and porcelains to the Ardabil Shrine and Arabic manuscripts to the Mashhad Shrine. His jewels, jewelled weapons, and gold and silver items were also part of this benefaction. Because the collections of the three shrines are only partly published, the research will involve visiting Iran and studying the works from Ardabil in the National Museum in Tehran and from Mashhad and Qum in the shrines' museums. Some manuscripts from the Ardabil Shrine requiring research are in the Russian National Library, St. Petersburg. \n\nIn order to understand the intention of Shah `Abbas in renovating and endowing the shrines, the research team (primary investigator, co-investigator, and research assistant) will study historical texts, endowment documents and building inscriptions. These texts should help explain not only what Shah `Abbas did but also how his refurbishments and gifts were perceived by the users of the shrines. Work on the Qum shrine should determine to what extent Shah `Abbas I promoted the shrine as a pilgrimage destination and whether he ordered any renovations to its buildings. Some evidence suggests that the Shrine of Fatima Ma`suma at Qum attracted royal women's patronage; further research will elucidat the situation during the reign of Shah `Abbas I.\n\nSince Shah `Abbas's gifts to the shrines included imported items, such as Chinese porcelains, the question of value arises. Did Shah `Abbas give his most precious possessions to the shrines or were his gifts surplus to his needs? Although it may be difficult to tease the answers out of texts, study of manuscript illustrations and album paintings from the period of Shah `Abbas should provide information about the types of objects in use in the first half of the 17th century. A comparison of these items with those given to the shrines should suggest which shapes, motifs, and genres of objects were in fashion in the period of Shah `Abbas.\n\nBecause the Ottoman enemies of Iran controlled Mecca and Medina as well as the holiest Shi`i shrines in Iraq, Shah `Abbas promoted the shrines of Mashhad and Qum as alternative pilgrimage sites. The research project will explore the ways in which Shah `Abbas informed the faithful of the merit of visiting shrines within Iran. Moreover, the architectural changes that he ordered appear to have been motivated by the shah's desire to rationalise spaces for increasing numbers of pilgrims. The project will investigate how Shah `Abbas balanced piety with pragmatism in his gifts and renovations.\n\nThe themes that this project will explore have strong parallels with Shiism in today's world. Pilgrimage to the major Shi`i shrines in Iran and Iraq is still central to the belief system of the Shi`a faithful. Political realities such as the war in Iraq and, previously, the Iran-Iraq war have made it difficult for Iranians to travel to the major Iraqi shrines (Karbala, Najaf, Kazimayn) which has, in turn, heightened the importance of the shrines of Qum and Mashhad. It is hoped that that the elucidation of the historical context of Iran's largest Shi`i shrines will lead to a better understanding of Shiism in modern Iran.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82784</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/491CB3CF-4204-4CF8-81A7-030249EB044F"><gtr:id>491CB3CF-4204-4CF8-81A7-030249EB044F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shah 'Abbas: The Remaking of Iran</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8acbe613209c2eff0d32ad6b8ea6917d"><gtr:id>8acbe613209c2eff0d32ad6b8ea6917d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Canby Sheila R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780714124520</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F007590/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>568F0BBC-BF8B-412D-B94B-C13277B157B6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Islam</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
