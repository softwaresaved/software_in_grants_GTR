For any species to propagate, be it a single celled microbe or a human being, it must be able to duplicate its DNA; thereby ensuring that it passes its genetic instructions onto its progeny. This research proposal outlines a series of experiments that will investigate the final step in the replication of DNA. In cells, DNA forms a double helix. For the molecule to replicate, the double helix unzips and both strands are copied to generate two daughter molecules. The structure formed as DNA unzips and is copied is termed the replication fork. Towards the end of replication, two forks will approach each other and collide. This collision of the two forks must resolved carefully so that two complete daughter molecules are generated. This process is called replication termination. We propose to study the molecular basis of replication termination in a class of microbe, termed the Archaea. The Archaea we work on grow in hot spring environments, such as found in Yellowstone National Park. Because the organisms grow at 80 degrees centigrade, their cellular machinery is unusually robust and this stability greatly aids our analyses of the organism's biochemistry. Furthermore, over the last few years it has become increasingly apparent that the machinery that Archaea use to duplicate their DNA is a simplified version of the machinery that our own cells use. Therefore, as well as shedding light on the process of replication termination in the archaea, our studies may also yield invaluable insights into the evolution and mechanism of DNA replication termination in human cells too. The experiments that we propose will determine if replication forks simply collide randomly or whether there are defined road blocks in the DNA that create specific stop sites for the replication forks at defined termination sites. If the latter possibility is found to be the case, we will investigate the mechanism by which the road block functions. Our studies will be extended to investigate a replication fork pausing site that we have previously identified. This pausing site does not lead to termination, but rather simply stalls the fork for a short period of time. Although our earlier work demonstrated the existence of this transient pause site, we do not yet know why or how it causes forks to briefly arrest at this site. We propose to perform a series of experiments to establish how this pause in fork movement is effected.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>At the gross cellular level, archaea resemble bacteria. This similarity extends to the nature of archaeal chromosomes - being circular molecules (like most bacterial chromosomes) and containing polycistronic transcription units. However, the archaeal DNA replication machinery is related to that found in eukaryotes. Furthermore, we have previously determined that Sulfulobus species have three origins of DNA replication in their single chromosome. Work by Lundgren and colleagues has indicated that all three origins fire in most cells (Lundgren et al, 2004, PNAS, 101, 7046-7051). The fact that replication initiates at three distinct sites around the Sulfolobus chromosome means that there will be three sites at which replication forks converge and must terminate accurately, ensuring complete and precise replication of the DNA. The process of replication termination is well characterised in bacteria. However, less is known about the process in eukaryotes and nothing at all is known about replication termination in the archaea. We propose to investigate the process of replication termination in archaea, using Sulfolobus as a model system. We will perform a series of 2D agarose gel analyses to characterise DNA structures in the 100 kb windows encompassing the replication fork collision zones between the origins of replication. A combination of neutral-neutral and neutral-alkaline gel analyses will determine fork direction and will also reveal whether specific termination sites exist. If such sites are found, they will be characterised biochemically. In parallel with these studies, we will perform a genetic and biochemical dissection of a fork pause site that we have previously identified (Robinson et al, 2007, EMBO J., 26, 816-824). Finally, we will investigate the mechanisms of chromosome dimer resolution by studying the Sulfolobus Xer protein and its site of action on the Sulfolobus chromosome.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>302639</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A702A88A-06E2-49BE-A435-6AC23FB73FB9"><gtr:id>A702A88A-06E2-49BE-A435-6AC23FB73FB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Termination structures in the Escherichia coli chromosome replication fork trap.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of molecular biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/764cf90fb6cb43bf7fd5d45f89310dc2"><gtr:id>764cf90fb6cb43bf7fd5d45f89310dc2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Duggin IG</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-2836</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C8917D10-36D2-44FF-A9F9-284143AA67A6"><gtr:id>C8917D10-36D2-44FF-A9F9-284143AA67A6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Archaeal orthologs of Cdc45 and GINS form a stable complex that stimulates the helicase activity of MCM.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d0cd56c5d6f324ffe01776b7518642ba"><gtr:id>d0cd56c5d6f324ffe01776b7518642ba</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xu Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G00028X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
