Human societies depend on bees. In the UK, insect pollination is worth &amp;pound;400-500m per year and in California commercial beekeepers transport truckloads of honeybees to pollinate orchards on an industrial scale. Across the world, glasshouse production of tomatoes depends on the supply of bumblebees commercially reared in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the same time, declining bee populations have seized the public imagination, shaping campaigns against the use of pesticides in agriculture, adding impetus to concerns about the decline in biodiversity of flowering plants in rural areas, and leading to an upsurge in interest in urban beekeeping, and a trend for architects to design spaces for bees. Given the growing recognition of our entanglement with the world of the bee, and the dependence of agriculture, livelihoods and environmental sustainability upon it, this project asks how can the social sciences contribute to understandings of bee-human relations? 

The project aims to transform approaches to thinking about bees (and by extension other insects or animals) in the social sciences, the natural sciences and the general public. It will do this by developing a methodology that allows us to see bee and human activities as taking place together, in contrast to more conventional views which see humans and bees living separately in society and nature. We will investigate the practices of three different kinds of beekeeper - commercial beekeepers in California and the Netherlands, urban beekeepers in the UK and Denmark, and &amp;quot;barefoot&amp;quot; beekeepers in the UK - and identify how they relate differently to bees. By comparing these three different practices of beekeeping we will be able to analyse how beekeepers use their understandings of bees' worlds (&amp;quot;beenotes&amp;quot;) in order to shape and direct the lives that bees live (&amp;quot;beelines&amp;quot;). 

The project also aims to transform the way social scientists and the general public think about nature and society by taking up the cas of the bee. Whilst most nonhuman animals are seen to be inferior to humans, historically the organization of bee society has been taken as an inspiration for our own. These days bees have become ciphers for environmental concerns, and so the project sets out to investigate how it is that bees enter the polis by raising questions for debate, and bring nature into the city via the increasing practice of urban beekeeping. 

In order to disseminate the research findings, the project investigators will not just write academic papers, but they will seek to engage a wider public with the issues arising around our close association with bees. They will do this by writing a book about the research findings in the popular genre of nature writing, and by engaging a round table of experts and practitioners in order to plan and develop a project pack for primary schools and apply for funding for a museum exhibition. 

The project findings will also be of interest to policy makers in the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and urban planners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
The research is intended to have an impact on diverse but interrelated constituencies of groups working at different levels. The first will be policy makers at a domestic level who are interested in the relationship between bees, beekeeping, agriculture and the environment. They include government officials at the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs in England and Wales, and The Scotland Rural Development Programme, and the National Bee Unit, as well as town planners in local government. The second, perhaps most important group, is the wider public - in particular museums, schools and school children. 
How will they benefit from this research? 
The research will produce detailed empirical knowledge about the nature of human relationship with bees: that is the ways in which bees shape human societies, and humans shape the environment in which bees live. The project will also produce clear evidence for the coexistence of humans and bees, and thus the important role that social science can play in the production of knowledge about the natural world. The project aims to contribute to efforts to promote biodiversity and our relationship with nonhuman species, by demonstrating how social our relationship with creatures like bees really is. 
The research will contribute to evidence-based policy-making by producing practical policy briefings about the place of bees in our society, especially in urban environments, and agriculture. The research findings will also produce new information about the extremely diverse field of beekeeping practice, which will be useful for practitioners and policy makers alike. This information will feed into DEFRA policy issues related to bee losses, and the ability to target information about healthy beekeeping practices to different kinds of beekeepers. 
The most significant area of impact will be to increase public awareness of the nature and diversity of human relationships with bees. It will aim to make visible to the public the interconnectedness between bees and human activities in the arenas of environmental sustainability, agriculture, and changing views of nature and the city, and raise debate about how the plight of nonhuman creatures like bees can pose questions about how we live our lives. First, a book will be authored in the popular genre of nature writing about the associations between bees and human society, which will have wide-ranging appeal to members of the public and academia. Second, a round table of practitioners and other stake holders will meet three times during the course of the project in order to plan and implement the following activities: 1) In collaboration with Edinburgh University Widening Participation, working with local primary schools to produce a project pack for school children to learn about how we depend on bees, how different kinds of beekeepers &amp;quot;make&amp;quot; different kinds of &amp;quot;bee worlds&amp;quot;, and how beekeeping might transform the ways that we think about the difference between the city and the countryside; 2) in collaboration with the museum curators, planning, and putting forward an application for a funding bid for an exhibition called Beelines (provisionally in 2018) which would follow the different trails (in cities, industrial scale pollination, and practices for biodiversity) that entangle humans and bees together, with the aim of encouraging the public to recognise the efforts that beekeepers go to maintain our interdependence with bees.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>186085</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This event is designed to demonstrate how human societies and bee societies are entangled. It will incorporate a range of existing and new interactive installations and activities from interdisciplinary research projects. As an important environmental indicator with rich global cultural and social heritage, the honeybee is a potent symbol. As evidenced by our previous extensive public engagement activities, this complex and fascinating insect captures the imagination - everyone has a bee story!

Take part in our Beespoon installation and find out how much honey a single bee makes in its lifetime!
? Our Beespoon is 1/12th the size of a teaspoon and represents the amount of honey a single bee can make within her lifetime. Help us to think about the work of a bee by doing some work to try and fill the beespoon! By making an origami flower and placing it on our wall display, you will earn the chance to press the beespoon installation button. If you're lucky, a drop of honey will fall onto the beespoon, filling it up, drop by drop. 
? This activity allows participants to engage in the act of making, learning about how little honey a single bee makes, and leading them to reflect on the honey that they might put on their breakfast toast, how many bees it takes to make a jar of honey, and how far a single bee will fly during its lifetime. We will ask participants to think about their own life-times achievement. 

Design a beehive!
? What are honeybees and what are they for? This activity introduces participants to different kinds of beehive that are designed to encourage bees to do different kinds of things: bees can make honey, they pollinate flowers which produces fruit and vegetables, they rear their young, they guard their colony, and they exchange information by dancing on the honeycomb. We will design posters to explain how different beehives work, introduce the importance of the 'beespace' to honeybee architecture, and then ask participants to design their own hive
? This activity will encourage participants to reflect on how human perceptions of honeybees lead us to reach into and shape honeybee worlds

Feel like a bee, feel like a beekeeper

? Make a pair of bee glasses, and see the world from the perspective of a bee. Bees have five eyes - two of which are compound eyes, each with its own lens that looks in a different direction. Can you imagine what it would be like to inhabit a world that looks like this? 
? Learn to interpret the waggle dance, and draw a map to find out how bees show each other where the best flowers are. 
? Learn how a beekeeper uses their eyes to spot the queen, larvae, and worker bees on a virtual frame from a beehive; their ears to listen to the sounds of the hive and find out what they mean; and their nose to smell the scent of a healthy hive</gtr:description><gtr:id>47F76A48-67D7-419E-8FD8-5531CB578BB0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing - the event is in April 2017</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Great HoneyBee Collider, Edinburgh Science Festival</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Annual Conference of The Finnish Anthropological Society, Helsinki, Finland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>98635FDD-1AB1-4B3A-89B0-305B3A54E19E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two conference presentations ('City Bees', and 'The Apis and the Pasture') in panels at the Annual Conference of the Finnish Anthropological Society, Helsinki.

Different kinds of beekeepers have significantly different understandings of what bees are. This has implications for bee health. Conventional beekeepers who use the modern hive, direct bees towards productivity and deploy a Pasteurian approach to bee health - preferring to open up hives for inspection, and to treat disease with antimicrobials and miticides. 'Sustainable' or 'natural' beekeepers are less interested in directing bees towards productivity, and see a bee colony as one organism surrounded by a skin. These beekeepers see conventional beehives as a cause of poor health in honeybees, and have a range of strategies to deal with disease, including allowing natural selection to take place. 
2. Beekeepers can be differentiated on the basis of the sensory information that they rely on to know their bees. Conventional beekeepers predominantly rely on visual inspection of the inside of the hive, large scale migratory beekeepers rely on olfactory information gained from quickly lifting the lid of the hive. 'Sustainable' or 'natural' beekeepers deploy a meditative approach to their interactions with bees. 
3. City beekeeping requires a careful balance between making visible and rendering invisible in order for the general public to coexist with increasing urban honeybee populations without fear. City beekeeping organisations deploy forms of mapping - of hives, of forage, of bee hotels, and of postcode honey in order to encourage neighbourliness. City beekeepers however, must also take great care to manage swarms, which in turn shapes the kind of beekeeping that is possible in urban areas. Swarms often cause fear amongst the public even though they are generally harmless. There have been innovative projects, for example in Helsinki, which have attempted to turn swarm into a natural event of curiosity to people in the city.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will be useful to policy makers, beekeeping associations and individual beekeepers. They will facilitate understanding of some diametrically opposed beekeeping practices in particular in relation to the management of bee health. The range of sensory practices used by different 'types' of beekeepers could be shared more widely amongst the beekeeping communities. Strategies for managing urban bees, in particular swarms, could be explored further in cities and towns.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4B466EE9-019B-4981-9719-B161ED51EFE7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.beelines.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Fieldnotes, photographs and interview transcripts resulting from research with beekeepers and beekeeping events.
