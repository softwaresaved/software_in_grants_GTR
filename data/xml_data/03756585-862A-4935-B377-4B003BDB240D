The most deadly disease caused by an apicomplexan is malaria that kills millions yearly in developing countries. Other parasites from the group are also responsible for diseases in people with compromised immune systems, like AIDS patients. Still more, apicomplexans cause disease in agricultural animals, resulting in major economic harm and damage to humans food supply. Toxoplasma, for example, is one of the most frequent causes for abortions in sheep.

These small, single-celled parasites live and multiply within the larger cells of their human or animal host. Accordingly, these parasites evolved elaborate tactics to minimize exposure to host defence systems while still harvesting their needed metabolites from this hostile environment. Two organelles within each parasite, called the mitochondrion and the apicoplast, play crucial roles in this struggle by providing essential centres of parasite metabolism. Consequently their function is essential and their maintenance is tightly regulated and synchronized with the parasites' proliferation. Each parasite possesses one mitochondrion that divides and changes morphology in full synchrony with the parasite cell division. This is unlike the situation in human and animal cells where the many mitochondria found in each cell replicate, change and function independent of the cell division.

Mitochondria were acquired via endosymbiosis whereby one cell was engulfed by another and was gradually enslaved to become a dependent organelle. Molecular transport mechanisms through which the organelle and the cells could exchange materials had to evolve to allow this take-over. One such example is mitochondrial tRNA import (MITI). Since the mitochondria kept some of the genome of its ancestor it needs tRNAs to express its genes to functional proteins. While in most organisms the mitochondria still retain its own tRNA genes, in Apicomplexa all tRNAs are encoded in the nucleus of the cell and the mitochondrion must import all the tRNAs it needs from the cell cytosol, making MITI absolutely crucial for parasite survival. This pivotal role highlights MITI as a key player in controlling the tight synchrony between parasite and mitochondrion division. 

Despite the crucial important of MITI in the evolution of mitochondria, scientists have only described MITI systems in detail in a handful of organisms, resulting in a very limited understanding of its origin and development. Moreover, despite the essential role of MITI in the control of mitochondrial function in Apicomplexa, its composition and functional mechanism in these parasites are entirely elusive. In this study integrated and complementary approaches will be used to catalogue and analyse the components of the MITI machinery in the most well developed experimental system in Apicomplexa, Toxoplasma gondii. A detailed model of the MITI composition and organization will be generated via tagging of individual components and dissecting their interaction with each other and with the RNA in transit. The function of the individual components, and of MITI as a whole, will be analysed by genetically removing one component at a time. Not only will this provide the first description of MITI in a new group of organisms, it will also developed our understanding of MITI evolution, and how in the case of these parasites it supports their deadly lifestyle. 
A thorough understanding of the apicomplexa MITI system will also provide a new potential avenue for the design of novel therapeutic strategies to fight diseases like toxoplasmosis and malaria.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Apicomplexa are parasitic pathogens causing diseases like toxoplasmosis and malaria. Most Apicomplexa rely on the function of an extremely reduced single mitochondrion for survival and proliferation. This proposal aims to characterize the divergent Toxoplasma gondii mitochondrial tRNA import (MITI) machinery, with a view to understanding its unique features and mechanism of action. Recent data suggests that the MITI machinery has significant differences to previously described systems: despite the mitochondrial genome encoding crucial components of the essential mitochondrial electron transport chain, it does not encode tRNAs. We ask what adaptations took place to support the full dependence of mitochondrial translation on cytosolic tRNAs. Furthermore, it was shown that amino acyl tRNA synthetases are absent from the T. gondii mitochondria. We ask which new MITI functions developed to accommodate this unique situation. We aim to answer these questions by mapping the T. gondii MITI translocon and establishing the properties and function of its components.
I recently expanded the T. gondii molecular toolbox by developing new and powerful experimental strategies: a bioinformatics approach to identify components of endosymbiotic organelles that would otherwise escape detection; an enhanced system for essential gene disruption, which significantly sped-up this previously cumbersome process, creating one of the most important recent technical innovations in my field. Using these tools we will generate a large number of conditional mutants, which will be systematically analyzed to identify MITI defects. We also propose a new strategy to decouple the mitochondrion from other transnationally active organelles in T. gondii, providing an alternative and unbiased approach to identify MITI components. These tools will allow the study of MITI in T. gondii, and provide a model for mitochondrial research for the phylum, while producing impact on broader cell-biology research.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will primarily have significant impact to a broad range of academics in the UK and globally. In the long term it will contribute to the improvement of global health and economy, through informing and providing tools to develop better intervention strategies. Impact will also be delivered through mentoring and training of young professionals and academics and via direct engagement with the public.

Academic impact
This exhaustive study of the apicomplexan mitochondrial tRNA import (MITI) translocon will provide direct insight into mitochondrial biogenesis control in these parasites, which is a critical aspect of their successful lifestyle. The project will also provide knowledge that will shape the theory of mitochondrial evolution. 
This work's insights and finding will be highly relevant to academics interested in the biology of apicomplexans, specifically in organelle biogenesis and mitochondrial functions. This work will also impact the broader group of academic researchers interested in RNA transport pathways all across the eukaryotic tree. Finally, the large cohort of academics interested in cell evolution and the biology of endosymbiosis will benefit by this study. 
The findings generated in this project will be widely disseminated via publications in open access journals, presentations and discussion at national and international conferences, during invited seminars and via the Sheiner lab website.

Translation
This project will provide knowledge and tools that will inform future drug development research. The phylum Apicomplexa consists of pathogenic parasites, like the malaria causative agents and the opportunistic pathogens of immunocompromised human and of farm animals. The organism studied, Toxoplasma gondii is a model system for the phylum. Research of the apicomplexan mitochondrion physiology and metabolic functions already provided validated drug targets (e.g. Atovaquone target). Mitochondrial biogenesis pathways, including MITI, are crucial to support these functions. Moreover, evidence suggests that MITI is conserved among most apicomplexans but divergent from their human and animal hosts. These features lend credence to MITI as a promising source for drug targets. 
Developing stable and reliable drugs for apicomplexans proved highly challenging. New insights into basic biology are required to inspire the efforts for evolution and refinement of current intervention strategies. In the long term this work will contribute to improved treatments, lessening the global health and economic burdens of these parasites.

Training
The PDRA and research technician will be trained in advanced molecular biology and genetic manipulation techniques. They will be trained in data analysis, communication and presentation. I will mentor the PDRA through project design and management. These skills are highly transferable to other aspects of academic or industrial biomedical research. I will mentor the career progression of both staff throughout the funding period and beyond. My lab provides ongoing opportunities for master and undergraduate research placements (in 2014 we hosted two MRes student, and a veterinary 3rd year and a Brazilian exchange summer students), providing a first direct exposure to research and a path into PhDs and further research careers. The training and education of staff and students provides ongoing impact to medical science and technology.

Public outreach
I will take advantage of the ongoing engagement activities at Glasgow and at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Molecular Parasitology to present an accessible summary of the relevance and outcomes of this project. These include university open days, institute school visits and science clubs at schools. Endosymbiosis and medical parasitology are popular topics with which I fascinated public crowds before, promoting appreciation of our field, and impacting the choice of future generations to take part in or support research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>362319</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mechanism of mitochondrial Oxidative protein folding without the key disulfide donor Mia40: The parasite Toxoplasma gondii system</gtr:description><gtr:id>AA5657CD-3F03-4B34-9CE1-5EB1D041DF66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a recent collaboration.
