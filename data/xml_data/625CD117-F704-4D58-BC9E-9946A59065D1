This project will foster collaboration between policymakers, academics and the UK media sector to improve understanding of how the public domain might generate value: for producers, consumers, and the enrichment of UK society. Project co-funders the Intellectual Property Office have called for activities to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Map the nature of works available in the public domain and the frequency of their use&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Analyse the role of public domain works in direct and indirect value creation for UK firms&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Assist UK media companies in developing business models that draw benefit from public domain material.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This 12-month program addresses each of the above aims through a series of planned activities. First, an interdisciplinary conference will solicit perspectives on appropriate methodologies for evaluating public domain works. Three research activities will then take place: qualitative case studies generated in consultation with media SMEs, a quantitative study of public domain materials in Kickstarter media projects, and a multiple case study analysis of open source video game projects. A hothouse event for media businesses, in summer 2014, will initiate new business model generation around public domain material.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this project will be policymakers and staff at the Intellectual Property Office, and business in the UK media sector. 

The IPO have called for empirical research and related activity to better understand the potential of the public domain and its role in the UK creative economy. To serve the public as effectively as possible, policy in this area must be based on sound empirical research and consultation with the business community. As primary beneficiaries of this knowledge exchange project, the IPO will gain actionable empirical findings to guide informed policy making, consisting of three key knowledge areas: the size and value of the public domain, the exploitation strategies available to media businesses, and the possible influence on the UK creative economy in the coming decade. Since Government IP policy directly concerns the UK creative industry and consumers, the impact of this activity will be considerable and wide reaching. In particular, the Government will be provided with the tools to be able to estimate the value of the public domain for the creative industries and establish how different policy approaches might heighten or reduce its productive use.

The knowledge produced and disseminated by this project is will assist media businesses in developing strategies to exploit public domain works. Impact will consist firstly of raised awareness, by informing media businesses about the existence and availability of public domain materials. This will be accomplished via published outputs in partnership with the Intellectual Property Office, direct engagement with the business community via planned events and via online dissemination on the Copyright Portal and other websites. Secondly, the project will have behavioural impact by providing business managers with actionable and strategically beneficial sources of knowledge (such as the forward-looking database of works entering the public domain). It is expected that media businesses will expand their repertoire of IP strategy to include PD works, potentially lowering costs and thus providing a viable alternative revenue model for risk-averse media firms. The project is expected to produce benefits for the wider economy in terms of increased UK creative industry revenues and an increase in creative output based on public domain material.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39720</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This video explores the use of public domain and licensed copyright materials as inputs to commercial innovation.

Kristofer Erickson (University of Glasgow, CREATe), Fabian Homberg &amp;amp; Martin Kretschmer, &amp;quot;Measuring the costs and benefits of copyright re-use for follow-on creators: evidence from a crowdfunding marketplace&amp;quot;

This paper exploits the patronage-like features of an online crowdfunding market to study the effect of transaction and licensing costs on the ability of follow-on creators to successfully re-use existing works. We study the reported costs of production of 1,993 projects seeking funding on the Kickstarter platform from January to March 2014 to investigate if re-use of copyright material has a measurable effect on the cost of creation under four different conditions: (1) the creator has obtained a copyright license; (2) the creator vows to seek a license if funding is successful; (3) the creator borrows from a copyright work but does not discuss licensing; and (4) the creator borrows from a work in the public domain.

Previous experimental research has explored the effect of copyright protection on the ability of follow-on creators to in-license and transform existing works. Crosetto (2010) conducted experiments on sequential creativity in which players were given the opportunity to exclude others from a solution to a word puzzle in exchange for a set royalty fee. When the royalty fee condition was higher, participants tended to protect their innovations, leading to anti-commons conditions and a failure to transact. In a low fee condition, players obtained higher payoffs by opening initial innovations and extending other players' open solutions. Bechtold et al (2016) employ a similar experimental approach to study creators' ability to judge whether borrowing or originating is the most beneficial strategy under different licensing cost conditions, on the assumption that copyright imposes costs on sequential innovators:

'According to rational choice theory, a would-be creator, faced with this borrow/innovate decision, should compare the costs and benefits of borrowing with the costs and benefits of innovating. Borrowing entails a variety of costs including, primarily, licensing fees and transaction costs. Innovating, on the other hand, may involve substantial investments in research and experimentation that borrowing does not.'

The authors analyse 1,993 product pitches on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter for the first quarter (January - March) of 2014. The sample includes successful, unsuccessful, and cancelled or suspended projects in the categories of publishing, video games, comics, theatre and film. These categories were selected because they consist of expressions which can be protected by copyright, and thus have comparable licensing parameters. Other categories include products which can be protected with patent or design right, which have different licensing requirements.

The authors estimate an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model on the reported cost of production for media products in five categories. Controlling for popularity, status of pitch creator, previous experience and other factors which may influence perceived value, we find a moderately significant negative effect of in-licensing of copyright works on the price of a good set by creators, compared to 'pure' original works. The authors interpret this to indicate that in-licensing has a cost-savings effect for creators. The result is somewhat confounded by the lack of a corresponding significant effect for the re-use of works in the public domain (non-copyright inputs). We interpret this to indicate that in-licensing of third-party IP confers additional cost-savings benefits to creators beyond simple permission to use an expression (such as valuable tools or assets related to the license). To test for the presence of increased payoff for original creators, the authors use a logistic regression employing the outcome of success or failure for product pitches as dependent variable. Holding constant the amount of funding initially pitched for (which is shown to significantly impact the outcome), we find a strongly significant positive effect for transformative use in both in-licensing and public domain adaptation, on the likelihood of a project's success.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://aoir.org/aoir2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited WIPO Seminar on Economics of Intellectual Property</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>46A0FFFA-4732-4886-B188-2A506FC1AE9B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Investigator Erickson was invited to present findings from the ESRC funded study 'Valuing the Public Domain' to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a specialist agency of the United Nations in Geneva.

Following primary research activities undertaken with knowledge exchange partner the UK Intellectual Property Office, a public stakeholder workshop was held in December 2014 to disseminate preliminary research results to business and policy stakeholders involved in creative economy activities. The event took place at the offices of Digital Catapult in London on 4th December 2014 and drew 55 attendees as well as 10 speakers, including representatives from creative businesses involved in the research, the British Library, Wikipedia, and the Intellectual Property Office Economic Research and Evidence team. 

Research outcomes from the project were published in an 81-page report by the UK Government in March 2015. The report has been shared with participant stakeholders and was widely cited in the press, including by Fortune Magazine, WIPO Magazine, The Conversation, Phys.org and Netzpolitik.org (a major internet policy media outlet in Germany). Wikipedia, which was a stakeholder partner in the research, made direct use of the results to inform internal policy on the collection and display of images on content pages. Our public domain research study was discussed at length by Wikimedia Foundation staff in the Wikimedia Research Newsletter Vol 5, Issue 4, April 2015, which targets research on and about Wiki practices for organisation staff, editors, and users. 

The Wikimedia staff wrote: 'At any rate, this reviewer thinks that the positive impact of the lack of copyright royalties is proven and confirms the authors' thesis. It is quite challenging to extend the finding to the whole English Wikipedia, all Wikimedia projects, the entire free knowledge landscape and finally the overall cultural works market; and even more fragile to put a price tag on it. However, this kind of one-number communication device is widely used to explain the impact of legislation and numbers traditionally used by legislators are way more fragile than this. Moreover, the study makes it possible to prove a positive impact on important literature authors and their life, i.e. their reputation, which is supposed to be the aim of copyright laws, while financial transactions are only means.'

Additional societal and economic impacts:

Our public domain research was featured in the August 2015 issue of WIPO Magazine, published by the World Intellectual Property Office, a specialised agency of the United Nations in Geneva. WIPO Magazine is distributed online and print around the world and is published in three languages: English, French and Spanish. In a press release by WIPO on 22 June 2015, Chief Economist Carsten Fink commented favorably on the study, 

'In the intellectual property system, there is this inherent balance that policy makers try to strike between, on the one hand, giving incentives toward creative and inventive activity, and on the other hand, recognizing that creative works and inventions have public-good characteristics and should be disseminated as widely as possible.' (WIPO, 22 June 2015).

In a speech to European MEPs on 3rd March 2015, titled 'Towards a new legislation on Intellectual Property in the digital single market', European MEP Julia Reda cited our public domain research while arguing for political action to preserve and enlarge the digital public domain in Europe. Discussing our empirical results on the value of Wikipedia, she stated:

'What these authors found was that first of all, for people of interest who have a Wikipedia page, when they died a very long time ago and there are pictures available in the public domain, it is a lot more likely that a site like Wikipedia is going to have a picture available on the page, and this is significantly contributing to the number of people who actually access it. So having these kinds of works increases the understanding, increases the attractiveness of a site like Wikipedia. So what you can see is that if we don't have a public domain, projects like Wikipedia, which are in the public interest, would not even be possible to start, because the commercial investment that would be needed to clear the rights to images would be a huge obstacle to any commercial business going in this direction.' (MEP Julia Reda, 3 March, 2015).

The 'Valuing the Public Domain' study continues to produce impact at the European policy level by supporting specific initiatives to re-balance copyright law in support of new economic opportunities and the public interest.

In an email to the principal Investigators on 14th July 2015, MEP Reda commented on her use of the research results in shaping and supporting her political effort to reform aspects of copyright law in Europe, writing that 'evidence on the value of the public domain and on the return of investment in libraries has been invaluable in making sure that at least some of my initial recommendations have survived the final vote.'

In 2015, The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) contacted the researchers to collaborate on further research arising from the public domain study. The EFF have launched an initiative to reform the legal, normative and commercial landscape for Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems. The effort includes the right of firms to launch innovative products that interoperate with the devices and services that consumers already own and use; and the right of security researchers to report defects in devices and systems. 

In a letter of support, the EFF write, &amp;quot;We were impressed with the methodological approach developed by Erickson and colleagues (in the 'Valuing the Public Domain' project) and we encouraged them to consider applying similar research approach to the question of the economic value of DRM circumvention, in order to map out the 'circumvention economy'.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4ABC1A3C-6816-4B0A-9556-62E589230C8D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project, titled 'Valuing the Public Domain', had the following aims: 1) map the size of the public domain in creative works and the frequency of its use; 2) analyse the role of public domain works in value creation for UK firms; 3) assist UK media companies to identify business models that derive benefit from the public domain. 

The non-rival, non-excludable nature of public domain materials would seem to limit their appeal to creators in a competitive market. Any observed commercial uptake of public domain material consequently raises important questions: What stimulates creators and firms to invest in transforming or re-publishing public domain works? How do firms gain and sustain competitive advantage when exploiting freely available public domain materials? What policy options are available to promote market uptake of public domain materials, and what are the likely impacts?

The researchers undertook three related empirical data collection exercises. First, an inductive study of entrepreneurial decision making inside of UK creative firms was based on interviews with 22 businesses that had successfully exploited public domain materials. Second, a computer-assisted content analysis of 1,993 projects on the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform enabled researchers to compare success rates of different kinds of IP in a live market, including public domain works. Third, a study of 1700 biographical web pages on Wikipedia permitted analysis of the value added to web pages where public domain photographs or those licensed under Creative Commons scheme were available. 

Overall, findings show that new works inspired by the public domain do perform well in the marketplace and can be a source of competitive advantage for innovative firms. Public domain materials appear to attract a higher rate of funding and success on the Kickstarter platform, likely because because public domain works are familiar to potential backers and operate as a signal of quality in a market characterised by information asymmetry and high risk. UK firms that have used public domain materials successfully report benefits at different stages in the value chain. For example, they might build proprietary technologies as wrappers around placeholder PD material, which is later commercialised at little additional marginal cost alongside other licensed copyright works; some firms develop original content within a user community of other fans and consumers of a PD work, producing creative products which connect with other offerings in the transmedia ecosystem; finally, some creative firms working on public domain materials find ways of connecting with public stakeholders around issues of local and national significance, essentially enrolling public stakeholders into the value chain as co-producers. Some firms use a combination of approaches and it is likely that new approaches will be developed. 

The theoretical proposition that overgrazing will diminish the value of public domain works does not appear to be a significant concern - firms are innovating with PD material despite the absence of exclusive rights in the source material.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The three main areas where action is encouraged on the basis of this research are in (i) valorising UK cultural heritage by increasing accessibility, (ii) clarifying the legal status of public domain works, and (iii) improving access to information about the public domain among commercial users such as SMEs. 

1) Valorising UK cultural heritage:
Research with individuals and firms revealed that creators struggle to locate public domain materials suitable for commercial exploitation. Where searchable archives of high-quality materials exist, innovators report significant benefits. A recent successful example is the British Library Mechanical Curator initiative and its various spin-out products. Unfortunately, digitisation efforts have until now taken place on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis and carry significant risk for archival institutions . Future efforts to digitise and make available works in the public domain should be particularly attuned to commercial and well as non-commercial uses. Members of the public are both consumers and stakeholders in relation to the public domain. As much as possible, members of the public and stakeholder communities should be involved in curating, preserving and disseminating public domain materials. Ideally, outputs should be of professional quality and should be presented in formats which are machine-readable, manipulable, and adaptable to different mediums.


2) Clarifying legal status of public domain works:
The creators involved in the study possessed varying degrees of knowledge about intellectual property. All expressed uncertainty when working with public domain materials. Specific gaps in knowledge included: when it is necessary to ask permission to use a work, and from whom; whether works by foreign creators may be used in the UK and under what conditions; what expressions are protected by copyright and what ideas or inspiration remain available for uptake; and what copyright rules pertain to digital or photographic reproductions of famous artwork. A number of academic initiatives in the USA and Europe in recent years have attempted to develop 'public domain calculators' capable of ascertaining the status of a given work, either automatically or with user input. However, these initiatives have failed to yield useful results, largely because of the complexity involved in determining the copyright status of a work, even within a single territorial jurisdiction. Government should provide guidance on those issues, in a format that is accessible to creators and businesses. Educational initiatives should be aimed at helping UK firms understand what is likely to be still in copyright and what is likely to be in the public domain. Increasing the strategic capabilities of the UK media sector with respect to intellectual property will likely increase licensing of copyright works alongside uptake of public domain materials - both types of usage require similar legal awareness and capacity.

3) Improving information systems:
This research demonstrates that entrepreneurs have developed business models that add value to underlying materials drawn from the public domain. Rather than express concern about the possibility of competition from later market entrants, creators were confident that they were able to retain competitive advantage on the basis of proprietary innovation. Respondents focused their concern on transaction costs: searching for and using public domain materials was often more costly than licensing a copyright work or developing original work, disinhibiting creation. Centralised databases of works with associated metadata, such as the Wikimedia Commons project, have sought to overcome the problem. Initiatives to increase the centralisation and searchability of public domain data will likely lower these barriers to entry and encourage innovation and new products. Government is encouraged to consider further research on markets where open innovation occurs, focused on enumerating the costs and benefits of open, searchable resources for creative entrepreneurship (as this is emerging as a key concern in debates about public open data).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A93C4EA0-3B7E-455B-BF83-9AD6430CCAE5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/copyright-and-the-value-of-the-public-domain</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation by MEP Julia Reda in support of copyright reform</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A791C8B-EF34-494F-914D-70F8ECA86E66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In a speech on 3rd March 2015, titled 'Towards a new legislation on Intellectual Property in the digital single market', European MEP Julia Reda cited our public domain research while arguing for political action to preserve and enlarge the digital public domain in Europe. Discussing our empirical results on the value of Wikipedia, she stated:

'What these authors found was that [...] having these kinds of works increases the understanding, increases the attractiveness of a site like Wikipedia. So what you can see is that if we don't have a public domain, projects like Wikipedia, which are in the public interest, would not even be possible to start, because the commercial investment that would be needed to clear the rights to images would be a huge obstacle to any commercial business going in this direction.'

The research shows that reducing the public domain would incur welfare costs for society, and the authors calculate those costs in terms of access to free content on Wikipedia, amounting to between USD $200-230 million annually in consumer surplus. Wikimedia Foundation used this evidence as a basis to argue for halts to copyright term extension and other restrictions on the size of the public domain.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Newsletter/2015/April#Excessive_copyright_terms_proven_to_be_a_cost_for_society.2C_via_English_Wikipedia_images</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>In support of the research project 'Valuing the Public Domain', the research team developed a bespoke software tool to extract information from the online crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and analyse its contents.
