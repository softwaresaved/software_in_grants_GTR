The neuronal circuits in the neonate are set up to interpret neural signals while the construction of the brain is still ongoing, with certain cell populations present only during such formation stages. These early cells and their functions are key components for the eventual maturation of the brain similarly to the dynamic transient scaffolds used for the construction of complex buildings.
We have a long-standing interest in studying these early-born cells and their involvement in both the normal and abnormal development of the brain. In particular, we focus on a transient compartment characterized by transient neuronal population and temporary synaptic connections called the subplate. Subplate cells are amongst the first born in the cerebral cortex, they initially represent a large cell group distributed in a zone between the site of neurogenesis and their final destination providing a platform for cortical development. However, these cells are only present during embryonic and early postnatal life and if the cortical development proceeds normally, they die at a particular stage. 
The transient nature of these cells highlights their importance in the assembly of a fully functional brain as well as their susceptibility to damage. We investigate the consequences of prematurity or perinatal brain damage on these cells, and the consequences of ablating them during the developmental time window for neurosecretion. 

With previous MRC grant funding during the past fourteen years, we characterised the early connections arriving to the cortex, gene expression patterns in subplate neurons at various developmental stages and also identified molecular markers for transient subplate neurons which now help us in the detailed study of these cells in animal models and in humans. This highlighted that many genes that are active in the subplate encode extracellular proteins. We recently described that subplate cells have the shape and intracellular machinery to secrete such proteins (Kondo et al., 2015). Protein secretation and vesicular release is downregulated following conditional knock-down of SNAP25 in subplate cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that one of these proteins - neuroserpin - is upregulated in a rat model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia, as well as in normal brains at the peak of cell death. Combined with evidence from the adult stroke literature, this suggests that neuroserpin may play a neuroprotective role.
We wish to capitalise on our previous achievements by identifying the role that secretion from subplate cells might play in normal brain development and in perinatal damage, particularly by testing whether neuroserpin can reduce the injury following hypoxia ischemia in mice.

Our major objectives are:
1. Characterise the timing and expression levels of neuroserpin and other secretory proteins in mice during development and after hypoxia. Study neuroserpin expression (mRNA and protein) in human.
2. Prevent secretion from subplate cells by blocking regulated vesicle fusion or by removing subplate cells altogether from early postnatal stages and study the consequences this has on brain development.
3. Study the effects of hypoxia in mice after viral delivery of neuroserpin into the brain or in neuroserpin knock-out mice.

The outcome of this project will bring fundamental insights into the workings of brain development as well as its susceptibility and response to early brain injury. They will help to establish methods of ensuring healthy brain maturation by developing for the understanding necessary for effective treatments of brain damage after hypoxic ischemia and management of development in premature infants.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our long-term research programme is to study the mechanisms underlying the formation of transient early cortical circuits that are crucial for the development of subsequent more permanent adult neuronal networks. Our hypotheses for this grant are:
1. Subplate cells have a secretory function. This function is transient and it is necessary for the normal maturation of the brain including vascularisation and myelination and maybe neuronal cell survival.
2. Neuroserpin, a serin protease released from subplate neurons in the developing brain has a stage-specific function in cell survival of subplate and/or surrounding cells. 
3. Neuroserpin has an additional endogenous function in preventing or reducing injury following neonatal hypoxia. This is based on our preliminary results demonstrating up regulation of neuroserpin following hypoxia in rats.
4. Increasing neuroserpin expression (via viral delivery) shall have a stage specific positive effect on the outcome (histopathological and behavioural) of neonatal hypoxia, whereas reduced neuroserpin levels (in neuroserpin KO mice) have a negative effect. 
These hypotheses shall be tested in animal experiments, and some findings extended to human post-mortem tissue. We will characterise the cellular localisation of proteins encoded by genes for extracellular molecules in mouse and human including neuroserpin and CTGF. We will test the proportions of these proteins that are made in subplate cells and the proportions that are taken up by them. We will characterise the role of neurosecretion from subplate cells by using animal models with reduced membrane vesicle fusion in subplate or without subplate cells. For this, we will use subplate cell specific Cre expression in the period combined with Snap25-flox or STOP-flox diphtheria toxin A mice. Neuroserpin protein levels will be analysed in hypoxic-ischemic animal models and the effectiveness of increasing or decreasing neuroserpin expression before hypoxia shall be tested.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Brain disorders are a major cause of human suffering and disability. In the developed world, there has been a gradual increase in the number of premature births and survival, but often with devastating disabilities. Additionally, a rise in the diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism has been documented. In developed countries, brain diseases impose a tremendous direct economic burden on public healthcare and, indirectly, an even higher burden on society as a whole through reduced ability to work and increased caring responsibilities of relatives. Advances in treatment and prevention of early-onset or developmental brain abnormalities will have a positive impact on an individual's well-being and their family, as well as reducing healthcare costs and improving economic prosperity of society. Our research will investigate new intervention and treatment strategies for neonatal hypoxia-ischemia and shed light on poorly described secretory functions of transient cell populations that may contribute to normal brain maturation.
The most common causes of brain disorders that have their onset at birth are related to hypoxic-ischemic brain damage and prematurity and current monitoring and medication of the diseased newborn brain is limited. Additionally, autism and schizophrenia are now generally considered to result from subtle developmental abnormalities of the brain. A complex interaction between the environment and susceptibility factors encoded in the genome drive a phenotype that only manifest after decades. Currently, we lack a basic understanding of the neurobiology of these disorders and our research intends to address some of those shortfalls. Both animal and human studies have shown that the immature brain is not just a small version of the adult brain - there are great differences between them. For example, an antiepileptic drug that is effective in the adult can in fact be harmful in the neonate. To be able to contemplate prevention, achieve early diagnosis and establish treatment, we need to increase our knowledge of the basic biology of the immature human brain, including non-classical neuronal functions like secretion of extracellular proteins, and this is where our proposed research programme is focused.

Early and effective causal treatment of brain developmental abnormalities has the real potential to have a huge impact on the life of the individual, family and society in general. Preterm and term infants who need early interventions and treatment will be the primary beneficiaries of our research and families of these infants will benefit from an increased understanding and better clinical care, possibly reduced caring burden.
Clinicians responsible for the care of infants with hypoxic brain injury will also greatly benefit from this research as it has the potential for informing best clinical practice and new clinical trials. We will have the greatest impact in this field by regular exchanges with practicing clinicians and by providing training and information to future practicioners. 
Our laboratory provides a wider benefit to society and the economy by training future generations of scientists and medics, and frequently hosting international student exchanges and visits (China, Germany, US, Canada, Brazil, Japan), which promotes overall economic prosperity by greater international understanding and cooperation. Our public engagement work also brings benefits by increasing understanding of animal experimentation. In addition, reaching the wider public can lead to greater understanding of brain abnormalities and disabilities which, consequently,brings a positive impact on equality and inclusion, especially amongst children.
Lastly, our image data can be of interest to artists and primary school teachers trying to engage children in science through art and collage techniques using scientific materials. AHS's images of fluorescent brains have previously been used for this purpose.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>797531</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>News release on: Autism and Schizophrenia May Develop During Short Period of Time in Infancy</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>09EAB01A-5B51-4FDE-B650-71A76FB28246</gtr:id><gtr:impact>News release was helped by our work and our interview:

Genes connected to the two disorders may only be active for a brief window of time.
The study, while in mice, could provide clues about how the developmental disorders develop. Focusing on a region of the brain known as the subplate, where the first nerve cells develop, researchers at the University of Oxford, King's College London and Imperial College London found that genes linked to autism and schizophrenia were only active in these regions during early stages of brain development.

Neurons in the subplate region form the foundation for the network of neural connections that eventually crisscross the brain. Studying the way that nerves develop and join this network can reveal where the growth can go wrong and trigger diseases such as autism or schizophrenia.

I regularly advise journalists on publications related to autism and schizophrenia and on general issues on brain development.

On 14th January 2014 a mini Symposium organised by Andrew King and Zolt&amp;aacute;n Moln&amp;aacute;r served as the first joint cluster meeting between the systems and cellular neuroscience groups of the DPAG. The meeting covered a wide range of topics focussed around &amp;quot;Mammalian cerebral cortical circuits&amp;quot;.

The joint cluster meeting brought together groups who are experts in the field of cerebral cortical circuit formation and plasticity in mammals. Their expertise extends from neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the establishment and plasticity of connections. These groups use various techniques: laser-scanning photo stimulation, 2-photon microscopy, confocal microscopy, electrophysiology and behavioural testing. Their aim is to understand how mammalian cortical neurons control cortical development and plasticity and how they are integrated into functional cortical circuitry responsible for some of the most sophisticated sensory and motor processing.

The cluster meeting was linked to the visit of Professor Anne Mc Kinney, Vice Chair of McGill's Brain Institute, who delivered a keynote lecture on &amp;quot;Dendritic spines, autism and epilepsy&amp;quot;. Her laboratory has made a great contribution to the insights into synapse maintenance and plasticity in the mammalian cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

The symposium gave an excellent opportunity to continue to build links between McGill and Oxford Neuroscience.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.mcgill.ca/brain/international-partners/oxford-university/oxford-neuroscience-news</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The 2015 Brain Awareness Week Lecture at Museum of the History of Science, Oxford 19th March 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>08D24F5C-2374-47F5-B8C5-3A5E011DDF44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 2015 Brain Awareness Week Lecture at Museum of the History of Science, Oxford 19th March 2015.

A collaborative study between the groups of Professor Juan De Carlos (Instituto Cajal, C.S.I.C., Madrid, Spain) and Professor Zolt&amp;aacute;n Moln&amp;aacute;r (Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford UK) has provided evidence for a new source of the earliest generated cerebral cortical cells, the subplate. In their recent publication in the journal Proceeding of the National Academy of Science USA (Pedraza et al., 2014) they describe that a considerable proportion of these early generated cells (known as the subplate) originate from an unusual and unexpected source, in the anterior and medial part of the telencephalon, outside the cerebral cortex itself. Previously, it had been generally accepted that they originate locally from the germinal zone of the cortical neuroepithelium. 

These subplate cells in the embryonic cerebral cortex are particularly interesting for clinicians concerned with brain developmental abnormalities, since they provide a transient scaffold for the developing cerebral cortex and assist in the development of cortical connectivity, effectively providing the foundation of the adult structure. Indeed, the first synaptic contact in the cerebral cortex is established between subplate cells and the first thalamic fibers that reach the neuroepithelium. Disruption or damage to these early cells could be the source of flaws that lead to cerebral cortical developmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, schizophrenia and autism. The discoveries that these scaffold cells arrive after a longer and more arduous journey might be significant to understand developmental disorders, because the process of their migration could be vulnerable and could be the cause of some cortical developmental abnormalities. If the scaffold is not assembled in the right time at the right place, then other aspects of the building work of making a brain can suffer which may only manifest in later life. This makes the discovery of this unusual origin and migration of the subplate neurons important for the developmental neurobiology and clinical neurology community.

The team in Madrid, led by Professor De Carlos noticed that some subplate cells originate from an unusual anterior and medial location (rostral medial telencephalic wall) and migrate tangentially through long routes to the cerebral cortex. The team at Oxford studied a selective subgroup of subplate cells expressing Lpar1 (Edg2) which had similar distribution and characteristics to the labeled cells found by De Carlos and his team (Molecular diversity of early-born subplate neurons. Hoerder-Suabedissen A, Moln&amp;aacute;r Z. Cereb. Cortex. 2013 Jun;23(6):1473-83). When the two teams compared their results on a meeting they decided to use cell-tracker to label rostral medial telencephalic wall in the mouse strain with fluorescently labeled Lpar1-positive cells. These experiments showed a very good match and clearly demonstrated that indeed this subset of labeled subplate cells originated from this unexpected and unusual anterior-medial source in mice. 

The layer of subplate cells is in the Cerebral Cortex of all mammals, but their size varies between species, being wider in humans and primates. This suggests that subplate cells are not a vestige of early neuronal structures, but a fundamental structure involved in early stage of cortical development. For this reason it will be important to study this source also in humans and hence, it will be imperative to study abnormalities of this particular subplate cell population in human cognitive disorders. It has been previously found that many of the schizophrenia and autism associated genes were expressed transiently in subplate during development (Expression profiling of mouse subplate reveals a dynamic gene network and disease association with autism and schizophrenia. Hoerder-Suabedissen et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Feb 26;110(9):3555-60). Studying the way that nerves develop and connect this network can reveal where things can go wrong and trigger diseases such as the mentioned cerebral palsy, autism or schizophrenia.

A total of 5,835 protein-coding genes and 66 noncoding RNA loci are differentially expressed (&amp;quot;patterned&amp;quot;) across the layers, on the basis of a machine-learning model (naive Bayes) approach. Layers 2-6b are each associated with specific functional and disease annotations that provide insights into their biological roles. This new resource (http://genserv.anat.ox.ac.uk/layers) greatly extends currently available resources, such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and microarray data sets, by providing quantitative expression levels, by being genome-wide, by including novel loci, and by identifying candidate alternatively spliced transcripts that are differentially expressed across layers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>48337D93-A43A-4A1A-8B9B-FC372B814171</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the first website that describe the layer-specific transcriptome of the adult mouse cortex using deep sequencing method.

The in utero electroporation method has enabled the field to administer plasmids to these neural progenitors, allowing temporal and cell type-specific control for the manipulation of gene expression.

Substantial populations of cerebral cortical neurons are generated in a specific sequence by the radial glia progenitors that line the ventricular surface during development. These radial progenitors self-renew and generate intermediate progenitors or neurons in a precisely choreographed fashion. 
in utero electroporation has become a central technique in the study of key aspects of neural development, such as progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and circuit formation. This method has also facilitated the exploitation of cell lineage and optogenetic techniques in various species from chick to gyrencephalic higher mammals. This chapter provides a description of the method and gives some examples for its utility in the study of cerebral cortical development and evolution.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>In Utero Electroporation Methods in the Study of Cerebral Cortical Development</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-3014-2_2</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A180EF5C-FE1B-4139-BB74-CDC29E605B55"><gtr:id>A180EF5C-FE1B-4139-BB74-CDC29E605B55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Neurodevelopmental disorders: Risks of Zika virus during the first trimester of pregnancy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature reviews.
