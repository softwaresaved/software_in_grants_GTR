The ways communities are connected with each other and with the 'outside world' vary. In some groups strong internal bonds may exclude outsiders, while in others the connections enable a more inclusive approach to the world. Troubled communities tend to have more connections of the strongly bonded, exclusive kind. 
? Structural and economic features of a society may affect the nature of connections within communities, and more work is needed on the effects of steep income gradients on the nature of communities locally as well as nationally. 
? Community cohesion initiatives appear in many cases to have been successful, but further research is needed on the conditions that enable communities to develop cross-cutting forms of connectedness rather than strong, internal bonds. 
? Social networking and other communication technology is enabling new kinds of 'virtual' community connections to form but these tend to reinforce existing kinds of community and may be restricted to particular kinds of user. 
? People need to connect with others and to find identity in the connections they make; where opportunity for connection is weak, criminal offending is higher. Gangs may serve the purpose of giving identity where other forms of connection do not exist.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>? Given the confirmation of the broad utility of bonding and bridging across a range of work (notwithstanding the tendency of the distinction to mask structural determinants of community characteristics), particularly in troubled communities, we suggest that research needs to be carried out on the activities, work, organisation, etc. that characterise bonding and bridging in practical circumstances. 
? While much research has been undertaken at a national level on the significance of income gradients, there has been far less work on their significance at community level. Research to explicate the effects of, for example, adjacency of communities between which there are steep gradients would be useful, given their significance at national level.
? Top down action, as for example in the community cohesion programme, appears to be successful in connecting communities, is valued by community group leaders and should be promoted. Research specifically on good practice is needed.
? Ways for brokering relationships within communities, fostering group membership, and promoting the employment of artefacts such as books and websites (as 'symbols' of community group identity) should be sought in any attempts to support community. Practical implementation should be researched.
? New technology offers opportunities for community connection, but is currently used by a limited range of people; research is needed on ways of spreading the benefits more widely, and how in schools and colleges young people can get the the opportunity to discuss and learn about a wider range of media.
? Gangs offer identity to disadvantaged young people; alternative sources of group identity for young people - for example in clubs, after-school activities and work schemes - need to be more widely available. Research should seek ways of making additional activity of this kind work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0AD3FC80-2915-44B3-A949-AE99E8C8B0B6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-social-sciences/education/projects/ahrc-discussion-paper-the-nature-of-connectivity.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J501030/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
