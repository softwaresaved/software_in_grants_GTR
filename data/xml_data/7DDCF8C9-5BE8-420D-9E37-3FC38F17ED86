The research program is entitled 'The production and application of Japanese alloys and patination' and will run from May 2007- April 2010. \nIn this application we seek funding to complete research in four areas of the overall fellowship program. This research was outlined in the original fellowship application and is central to the overall research program. Funding from the AHRC will ensure that the research is carried out to the highest quality. \nThe Western tradition of metal patination and colouring is based on the use of a small range of metals and alloys which are coloured by the application of a wide range of patination solutions. In contrast to this, Japanese metalworkers developed a wide range of irogane alloys which are coloured with a single patination solution (the niiro chakushoku eki or boiling colour patination solution). This approach allows different alloys to be combined in one piece and patinated, producing a multi-coloured piece of metalwork.\n\nThis study will examine in detail:\n1. Pre-patination treatment of alloys with daikon radish.\n2. Composition of solution ingredients and their effect on patination colour.\n3. The use of protective coatings on niiro patinated surfaces.\n4. Trial of the materials and techniques with non-expert metalworkers\n\nWork in the previous part of this project has demonstrated that the use of daikon improves the patination of silver alloys. In order to produce a consistent process it is necessary to determine exactly what the radish treatment is achieving.\n\nThe research will ask:\nWhat are the active compounds in the daikon radish?\nCan we achieve a similar effect with laboratory chemicals?\n\nThe patination process is not yet optimised, especially with respect to some of the vital secondary ingredients. \n\nThe research will ask:\nWhat is the effect of secondary ingredients on patination colour?\n\nIt is not known how effective are coatings used for the preservation of colour and for protection from handling and corrosion, which is of particular importance for commercial applications.\n\nThe research will examine the change in colour over time and the use of protective coatings:\nDo patinated colours change with time?\nDo waxes and lacquers work and if so what are they preventing? \nAre there new technologies which provide acceptable alternatives?\n\nThe applicant works with these materials and processes in his own studio work and evaluates their potential through his practice. It is important to also carry out a trial with a group of non-expert metalworkers to further evaluate practical application of the materials and processes.\n\nThe research will ask:\nCan these materials and processes be used by a group of non-experts?\n\nA limited number of researchers have published work on pre-patination surface treatments and the composition of the niiro solution. However, a full understanding of the process has still to be achieved. This study will be the first to focus on coatings for irogane alloys.\n\nThe research will be located at Sheffield Hallam University using the facilities and expertise of the Art and Design Research Centre (ADRC), the Materials and Engineering Research Institute (MERI) and the Biomedical Research Institute (BMRI). \nPapers will be submitted to an academic journal and an international conference. The research will also be disseminated through lectures and workshops. The University website will be utilized for the publication of papers, exhibited works etc. Commercial collaborators will be sought through SHU to exploit any materials or processes that are developed.\nThis project is a fundamental part of the larger research programme as surface cleaning, control of the niiro solution, and protection of the patinated surfaces are all crucial to the successful control and application of the materials and processes in studio work or in industrial applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research program will allow us to significantly advance knowledge of technical issues relating to niiro patination and irogane alloys. By developing a reliable and repeatable process, we can provide solutions to the problems faced by designers and makers working with these materials. The research is also important for those working with the preservation and restoration of historical metalwork as it provides insights into how this work was originally produced, and how to repair and preserve it. \n\nWe will be publicizing our research findings to jewellers and silversmiths through lectures and workshops at Higher Education Institutes in the UK, Ireland, and Japan. The studio work will also be publicized through public exhibitions.\n\nOur recent presentation at the Santa Fe Symposium to an audience of leading E.U. and North American manufacturers was received with great interest. As a result of this we have started discussions with an alloy producer about possible commercialisation. This dialogue with manufacturers will continue during the research project. As part of our dissemination strategy, we will present the findings of this research at an international conference in this field.\n\nThis project is an innovative practice based multi-disciplinary study involving both applied artists, material scientists and bio-scientists. We plan to reflect on this aspect of the project and produce a paper for a journal discussing our experience of this process.\n\nThe work is also of interest to curators working with historical metalwork in the area of preservation and restoration of historical work made using these techniques. We have recently begun working with the V&amp;amp;A museum to analyse work in their collection. This is a relationship we hope to develop further.\n \nThere are also a number of other areas where there will be possible impact beyond the main focus of the project. Researchers examining corrosion inhibition in precious metal and other systems will benefit from the findings. Producers and researchers who work in the areas of transparent protective coatings will benefit from the research information. There are also possible cross-links with those studying the health benefits of radish (e.g. iso-thiocyanates). We will consider dissemination of findings to their specialist audiences through our MERI and BMRC colleagues.\n\nThe research has the potential to develop new products for UK business to market internationally, for example a range of metal alloys, cleaning solutions, patination solutions and educational materials for jewellery producers or as finished pieces of metalwork or jewellery. \nFormal partnership, collaborative or exploitation agreements will be put in place with external partners as the need arises. Outputs with potential impact will be identified through discussion between the researchers in ADRC, MERI and BMRC. Full use will be made of electronic media through the University website for the publication of papers etc. We will seek a permanent repository through SHU/other agencies to ensure the preservation of the research output (samples, papers etc.) We will seek commercial collaborators to exploit materials or processes that are developed. SHU has extensive experience in the exploitation of intellectual property rights, particularly in metalwork and has a dedicated team to support this activity.\nThe main responsibility for dissemination is with the PI, however he will be supported by Dr Hywel Jones and Dr Jamie Young in the production of research papers. This will build on established relationships in SHU. The cross disciplinary nature of this collaboration is crucial to the success of the overall project. Dr. Jones has a clear functional role in the project but, as an experienced academic, he will act as both advisor and collaborator.

From Richard Rabel's blog discussing the Five into Four exhibition:

C?il?n ? Dubhghaill is one of the brilliant young designers keeping alive the age-old tradition of silversmithing. There are too few artists like him, so we must show our support for ? Dubhghaill! His works have a noticeably Eastern influence and that is no coincidence - he studied in Japan and received a doctorate for research into traditional Japanese metalwork techniques (the Japanese have a marvelous history of incorporating different metals into stunning pieces). One of my favorite pieces in this show is his &amp;quot;Ritual 9&amp;quot;. Taking a cue from traditional Japanese koros, this vessel has the most beautiful speckled finish. The paper-thin silver is also an amazing contrast to what appears to be a very weighty object.

Another of his works in the show is this elegant bowl &amp;quot;Ceo 7&amp;quot;. Fashioned from a copper and gold alloy, I first took this for pottery until I looked closer. An &amp;quot;? Dubhghaill&amp;quot; piece for sure, I thought, this time working outside of silver to create this earthy, yet sophisticated piece. While we mere mortals would think working with copper or silver is the same, the talent in bringing these two different pieces to such a high level of perfection and beauty is actually quite a feat!</gtr:description><gtr:id>C363F0F5-F762-425F-AAAE-26901FF6FD01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work from this exhibition was purchased for the Irish State Art Collection.

This research tests the application of irogane alloy and newly developed synthetic niiro patination techniques through the production of a series of decorative vessels. By introducing Japanese alloys into the domain of the traditional silversmith, this work also challenges perceptions of fine crafted metal objects, disregarding hierarchies of value set up by precious metal commodity markets and the institution of the hallmark. 

Resulting from the application of material and process knowledge developed during earlier laboratory based testing these artefacts are an outcome from the practiced based study into Japanese metalworking techniques. (Irogane alloys and niiro patination).Small scale laboratory samples produced consistent results with the synthetic niiro solution but full exploration of the material and process properties and behaviours required extensive large scale craft workshop activity. Through this ongoing series of vessels, utilising hand forged hammer techniques and fabrication; creative possibilities have been explored by combining an extended range of irogane alloys beyond the standard palette usually encountered. The intrinsic material qualities and subtle variations of colours have been further exploited through surface enrichment and selective polishing resulting in surface finishes with new variegated colours.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C977C4AC-4518-474D-A4A7-347033506656</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work from this collection was purchased for the Marzee collection, Netherlands in 2012.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Coilin O'Dubhghaill at Galerie Marzee, Netherlands</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of vessels produced as a result of the research program.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C55592B4-DA08-46A0-AD5E-909CC13FB032</gtr:id><gtr:impact>European networking</gtr:impact><gtr:title>PAN, Amsterdam (2011)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>KeyPiece was a combined public exhibition and research event bringing together leading UK metalworking practitioners and their work in November 2009. The project was initiated by Coilin O'Dubhghaill and developed in collaboration with Maria Hanson and Christoph Zellweger. The project was described in detail in the publication: HANSON, Maria and WOOD, Nicola (2010). KeyPiece: Creating a critical dialogue in contemporary craft; Design and craft: A history of convergences and divergences: 7th Conference of Design History and Design Studies (ICDHS), Brussels, Belgium, 20-22 September 2010. 

The exhibited pieces provided the basis for discussion between the makers, along with other pieces brought along by the makers that were considered significant but not necessarily suitable for exhibition. The question of how a keypiece can be identified and defined led the makers to develop an understanding of the different roles objects they make play within their practice. 

The participants were: Lionel Dean, Coilin O'Dubhghaill, Sara O'Hana, Maria Hanson, Grace Horn, Antje Illner, Drummond Masterson, Tine de Ruysser, Lucian Taylor and Christoph Zellweger.

13 November - 31 December 2007

Seven Smiths brings together the new work of seven of the UK's leading silversmiths. Each has exhibited widely both in the UK and internationally, and between them their work is represented in most of the major public collections. Blackwell, filled with exquisite handwork in wood, stone and plaster, provides the peculiarly fitting backdrop for these new examples of an age-old craft. Some of the pieces made for Seven Smiths have evolved as a direct response to the Arts and Crafts Movement, the house and its spectacular setting.

Silversmith/designer Coilin O'Dubhghaill studied for a doctorate in Tokyo, where he mastered a range of techniques using coloured metal inlays, or irogane, which he now uses in combination to create vessel forms with an emphasis on surface pattern and colour. He is currently a research fellow at Sheffield Hallam University, researching the production and application of Japanese alloys, such as the copper/gold shakudo alloy, and their patination.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BEDC6A8B-1F61-42D0-B4D8-9CD7E618835D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK networking</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Seven Smiths, Blackwell, Bowness-on-Windermere</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.blackwell.org.uk/exhibitions/seven-smiths-new-work-metal-and-silver</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2007</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This was a follow up exhibition to the Seven Smiths exhibition at Blackwell, I showed a group of patinated vessels developed during the research project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>015E0AD0-AC13-4E49-80E8-D1A68F7A8150</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK networking</gtr:impact><gtr:title>9 Create, Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2007</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture delivered in Metalsmithing department, Tokyo National University of Fine Art and Music, Japan</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C317E41-B3BA-49F0-9233-82100887C299</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation provoked discussion about research into craft processes and the contrasting approaches used in the European and Japanese traditions.

The project was initiated by Coilin O'Dubhghaill and developed in collaboration with Maria Hanson and Christoph Zellweger. The project was described in detail in the publication: HANSON, Maria and WOOD, Nicola (2010). KeyPiece: Creating a critical dialogue in contemporary craft; Design and craft: A history of convergences and divergences: 7th Conference of Design History and Design Studies (ICDHS), Brussels, Belgium, 20-22 September 2010. 

The exhibited pieces provided the basis for discussion between the makers, along with other pieces brought along by the makers that were considered significant but not necessarily suitable for exhibition. The question of how a keypiece can be identified and defined led the makers to develop an understanding of the different roles objects they make play within their practice. 

The participants were: Lionel Dean, Coilin O'Dubhghaill, Sara O'Hana, Maria Hanson, Grace Horn, Antje Illner, Drummond Masterson, Tine de Ruysser, Lucian Taylor and Christoph Zellweger.

This project was supported by funding from Arts Council England/National Lottery and the Art and Design Research Centre at Sheffield Hallam University.


The Keypiece project developed dialogue looking at the relationship between objects and research within the metalwork research community which lead to the Beneath The Skin project and exhibitions, see: http://www.mariahanson.co.uk/beneath-the-skin/</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Speaker, &quot;Understanding Interdisciplinarity: Theory and Practice&quot; conference, Sheffield Hallam University, UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9990286C-DAA0-4E78-8439-2287DA98C6EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation, Radishes or isothiocyanates?

Pre-patination treatment of alloys with daikon radish. Our earlier work confirmed that the use of daikon radish as a pre-patination treatment reduced the formation of chlorides in the niiro solution. We have tested extracts from daikon radish on cu/ag alloys to evaluate their potential as inhibitors to the formation of chlorides but have not yet achieved conclusive results. Research is ongoing to determine the active compounds and to achieve a similar effect with laboratory chemicals.



Composition of solution ingredients and their effect on patination colour. We have tested the effect of secondary ingredients on the niiro solution such as alum, salt and citric acid and characterised the resulting patina. In particular the Cl level was found to be crucial to the formation of strong and desirable colours. This research is central to our development of a reliable synthetic niiro solution.



The use of protective coatings on niiro patinated surfaces. We have produced samples to compare a range of surface coatings on irogane alloys. The surface coatings include traditional materials and non-traditional coatings. These samples will be tested for change as part of a long-term study into the effect of protective coatings. This information is important for commercialisation of the processes, and for preservation and restoration of historical metalwork.



Trial of the materials and techniques with non-expert metalworkers. We recruited three craftspeople to conduct tests with the irogane alloys and niiro patination. Although experts in metalcraft, they have not used the irogane alloys and niiro patination process. The makers were selected for their interest in using the materials in non-traditional and innovative ways. This work was exhibited as part of an exhibition of contemporary research in metalwork and jewellery in Sheffield in 2011.



The research has been disseminated to a wide audience through conference papers, articles, lectures and exhibitions of studio work.



We extended the project to look at three other areas: electrolytic niiro patination, laser colouring of irogane alloys and the influence of cleaning during patination treatment. It was found that both laser colouring and electrolytic patination did not produce better colours or improve reliability. Although interesting results were achieved, including some new colours, further work would be needed to fully understand the behaviour of the alloys in these processes if they were to be optimized for use by craftspeople. Cleaning during the patination process was found to produce brighter patina colours through removal of large crystals and smearing of the oxide layer.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0B9AE47-37B0-4206-8968-5806E821ECEB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Culture/ Heritage/ Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4FAA595E-AAA6-48E1-9D2D-6148508F91D8"><gtr:id>4FAA595E-AAA6-48E1-9D2D-6148508F91D8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metal Mosaics: Customizing designs with homemade shibuichi and shakudo</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>MJSA Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7fa0eebd0f0a9027b97fad463f814751"><gtr:id>7fa0eebd0f0a9027b97fad463f814751</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coilin O'Dubhghaill (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7D6CBE1A-9D79-492C-BCE2-58D5774BE463"><gtr:id>7D6CBE1A-9D79-492C-BCE2-58D5774BE463</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reliable Irogane Alloys and Niiro Patination- Further Study of Production and Application to Jewelry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Santa Fe Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cfbf495411f888acc0f6efe617e84872"><gtr:id>cfbf495411f888acc0f6efe617e84872</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>A.H.
