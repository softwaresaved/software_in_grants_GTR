They are disproportionately represented in lower income countries and it has long been argued that poverty and disability are both a cause and a consequence of each other (DFID 2000; Yeo and Moore 2003). Despite some attempts to include disabled people in global development and poverty alleviation strategies, overall these have not been done in a systematic or sustainable way This research builds upon previous work undertaken by the Centre, including in the DFID-funded Cross-Cutting Disability Research Programme, which identified a series of common systemic barriers that disabled people encounter when accessing services, ranging from attitudinal, financial and non-financial resources, and lack information and inclusion in national level poverty reduction strategies. This research will build upon this work to inform understanding of the correlation that between these barriers, disability, and multidimensional poverty

It must be recognised that in settings where everyone is poor, where few people access wage labour, where school attendance is paltry, healthcare access is limited and social protection is almost non-existent then disabled people are not necessarily very different from their neighbours. Yet, as countries develop, there is emerging evidence of a 'development gap' (Groce and Kett, 2013; Groce et al., 2011; Lang and Murangira, 2009), whereby disabled people fall behind. Building on the World Report on Disability (2011), this study will contribute to understanding how this development gap occurs, and what can be done to bridge the gap - a key and original theme of this study

The research will focus on 4 low-income Sub-Saharan African countries: Kenya, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zambia. All have shown some development over the past decades, but there is still variation within their rankings in the Human Development Index (HDI) to enable cross-country comparisons to be made and provide an in-depth, nuanced understanding of how disabled people are more at risk of being excluded as social and economic development increases. 

The research will undertake comprehensive policy analysis that explores the apparent gaps between policy formulation and implementation, which may be a result of contradictions or overlap. It will examine the extent to which policies are actually addressing unmet needs and rights of disabled people and the level of financial and human resources required to ensure they are addressed. It will identify ways to overcome challenges and promote improved monitoring and evaluation strategies. This implies the need to maximise the quality of data governments obtain from census and national surveys. Consequently, in addition to policy and programme analysis, secondary analysis of existing data in the 4 countries will be conducted to highlight the lack of disability-specific information as it relates to multidimensional poverty and barriers to inclusion. To address this expected gap, a household level survey will be piloted to test the &amp;quot;disability and development gap&amp;quot; hypothesis, taking into account age, sex, location and impairment status, comparing disabled and non-disabled people. This will be supplemented by qualitative research with communities and individuals to provide in-depth context

The research will explore the nexus between disability, lack of inclusion, barriers and multidimensional poverty; provide guidance as to how the data gaps can be filled; and identify ways of overcoming barriers. The results will be of primary benefit to disabled people and their families as the direct targets of policies and practices that can be improved as a result of the research, and indirectly through the expected impact of the research on governments, policymakers, national statistics offices, researchers, disabled people's organisations, and other stakeholders working to alleviate poverty in Africa</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre has a global reputation in disability and international development research, regularly undertaking consultancies for UN agencies, and bilateral and multilateral donors. The research is timely as the negotiations of the post-2015 agenda will take place during the programme's lifecycle, and thus the results that are generated have the potential for global impact, by feeding directly into UN policy and programming. The Centre is in a unique position to maximise the impact of this programme, having on-going interactions and significant influence at the UN level.

The primary beneficiaries of the programme will include disabled people and their representation organisations, and National Disability Commissions in the four countries, who are well positioned to utilise the findings in policy, programming, advocacy and campaigning. The research will provide an invaluable and rich data resource - one currently lacking - to engage and negotiate with national governments and donor agencies. 

The results of research exploring the 'disability and development gap' have the potential to make a significant contribution to discussions around multidimensional poverty to academics and practitioners in Africa and beyond. The knowledge generated through this research will enable international development policy-makers and practitioners, including donor agencies to prioritise and implement programmes that most efficiently and effectively reduce poverty among disabled adults and children. It will generate new knowledge about the interactions between disability, multidimensional poverty and barriers, and provide guidance to national governments, policy makers, and statistics offices to ensure the specific inclusion of disabled people in national surveys. There is growing momentum in mainstreaming a disability component within national policies in these countries, but many ministries are grappling with the practicalities implementation. The on-going engagement with ministries throughout the lifecycle of this project has the potential to enhance their capacities to effectively design, implement and monitor progressive, human rights-based policies and programmes and that directly address the needs of disabled people. It will also facilitate stronger communication across and between ministries and other key stakeholders through its multidisciplinary approach.

Key stakeholder workshops, including representatives from government ministries, UN agencies, DPOs, NGOs and others identified by national partners, will be held in each country at the outset of the programme to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of, have engaged with, and input into the research programme. Following these inception meetings, a pan-African follow up meeting will be held to ensure maximum impact by promoting effective South-South communication from the outset. There will also be regular in-country dialogue through face-to-face meetings, as well as briefing papers, policy briefs and research summaries and other outputs during the course of the research to ensure continued engagement. These will be disseminated widely through national and international forums, as well as through a dedicated webpage. 

A workshop will be held in each country, the end of programme bringing together key stakeholders to present and discuss the findings and policy implications of the research. These will be of interest to all key stakeholders, including DPOs, government officials, donor agencies academics and mainstream and disability-focused development partners. A regional end of programme workshop will be held to discuss pan-African implications of the research.

Finally, an end of programme conference (likely in the UK) will showcase key research findings, lessons learned and policy recommendations. In the long-term, it is anticipated that these can be replicated in other low-income countries throughout Africa and globally</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1759628</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Opportunities for better data about disability in Liberia?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1759EA8E-666C-480D-9F50-45ED4DA3B936</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog relating to themes and research areas of this project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://gap.leonardcheshire.org/2017/01/23/opportunities-for-better-data-about-disability-in-liberia/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Persons with Down syndrome: the unheard voices of caregivers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FBF77BB8-1BC1-463B-9EC2-C6B1BB26BB7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A blog on key project themes.

In this first project year we have participated in:

1. Cambridge Disability Impact Initiative workshop (29 February-1 March). Professor Groce was joined by Mr Anderson Gitonga (UDPK, Kenya) and Mr Edson Ngirabakunzi (NUDIPU, Uganda) and they gave a joint presentation on project progress to-date. There were in-depth discussions on ways in which findings can be communicated to ensuring the greatest positive impact on the lives of persons with disabilities within the wider framework of the SDGs . 

2. ESRC-DFID Joint Fund for Poverty Alleviation Research in Pretoria, 16-18 March. Professor Groce and Professor Andrew State (Makerere University, Uganda) will attend the conference in Pretoria, a key opportunity to raise awareness of the project with other ESRC grant holders and develop key linkages and networks to increase its impact.

3. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Symposium on Disability and the SDGs (Feb 18-19th) - a conference attended by a mixed disciplinary audience, including non-academics from the NGO sector. Professor Groce presented an update on the research, which was well received

4. Press Coverage in project countries. The official project launches were well attended by a variety of stakeholders. These have led to a series of follow up discussions and networking opportunities.

Year 2: 

5. Presentation of Project, Interim Findings, Ministry of Health, Kenya, These have led to a series of follow up discussions and networking opportunities.

6. Presentation of Project, Interim Findings, University of Zambia. These have led to a series of follow up discussions and networking opportunities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CA8E24D4-57AE-4AE5-BB5B-F2AAEF7AC372</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We are in the second year of this 3 year grant and are beginning to generate findings from our initial series of tasks related to the project: a 4 country review of policy, secondary data analysis and linking of proposed policies to existing data as these relate to people with disabilities in the international development arena. The four-country household survey is soon to be underway, as well the qualitative components of the project. Final analysis of the desk review portion of the project and initial findings from the household survey will be available shortly, but for now, our findings include:

Interim findings and developments: 

1. There is a serious gap between national policies related to disability and development and existing data sets collected at national level. While on-going analysis will allow us to better identify broader gaps, data now collected often is not linked back to evaluation of the success/ effectiveness of existing policies. If disability inclusion is to be systematically achieved, particularly in light of the Sustainable Development Goals, greater attention needs to be paid/ systems need to be developed at the national level to link these two bodies of data together. In the coming year, a series of publications will be developed to build on these observations and on the National Reports soon to be finalized on our website.

2. Despite the gaps identified in Response 1, three of the four countries in which this project is being undertaken are making rapid strides to better collect disability related data - and Zambia undertook a National Disability Survey in 2015. However data collection is not being uniformly matched by analysis of this data once collected. 

3. The desk reviews and secondary data analysis have served as a key foundation for the development and piloting of a Household Survey (1200 households in each country - Sierra Leone, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia) that will be underway within the next few weeks. To be undertaken in the 4 countries, in 7 languages, we anticipate that the findings in this survey will add significantly to understanding disability and development issues in the four domains: education, health, employment, social protection.

4.. Initial analysis of 'Levers of Success' component of the project - a set of qualitative interviews to identify what allows some marginalized people with disabilities to rise above their impoverished backgrounds and 'succeed' - (success here being broadly defined in not just one but several domains; economic achievement, social inclusion, participation in broader society &amp;amp; etc.,) - indicate that while there are a number of contributing factors, access to education seems to be defining factor in allowing a disabled person to move ahead in their community and society. This is particularly interesting because it links to our broader question of accessible education - education being an area which until recently many disabled children and young people were systematically excluded from.

5. One additional development that we would like to highlight here - and perhaps long term one of the most promising outcomes from this grant - we have brought together a number of leading academics from 5 African Universities and 4 national Disabled Peoples Organisations - one in each country. Through regular team meetings, regionally based trainings, and both South-South exchanges and stronger links in-country between our partner academics and local Disabled Peoples' Organisations, we have hopes that we are building and supporting a network of regional expertise that will continue long after this grant is done. Already colleagues on this grant are developing the lead on papers in development and publishing blogs as well as presenting interim findings to Ministers. We anticipate much more of this in the final year of the grant, but we are very pleased that this new networking is beginning to move forward.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from this study contribute to a small, but growing body of data on disability and developing in the Global South. We anticipate that these findings will be used by fellow researchers both in-country, regionally and globally, by local Governments and Ministries, by international development agencies - (including DFID) and by UN agencies - such as UNICEF, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), and the ILO - organisations with which we already work regularly. Just as importantly, it is our intention to share our findings with national and regional disability advocates - to allow them to make informed decisions about how they work with their national governments around issues of policy, program implementation and meeting the goals, targets and indicators set by the new Sustainable Development Goals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>82B826D0-1884-4635-8027-72E90D568624</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>As part of this award, a new Household Survey is being developed and will be implemented in the next few months - (Year 2 of the award).
