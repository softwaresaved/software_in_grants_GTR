This study\nfocuses on the persuasive rhetoric of Hildegard's liturgical works (text and\nmusic) that represent her idealized vision of her communities. It\nfocuses, in particular, on her liturgical office dedicated to St Ursula (13\nof her 77 liturgical songs), since St Ursula's legend provided women leaders\nwith a model of a powerful leader of a women's community.\n\nAims and Objectives:\nThe aim of this research is to analyze the rhetoric of both the text and music\nof the liturgical office dedicated to St Ursula. The requires the following\ntasks: (1) Placing the songs within the context of Hildegard's extensive\nvisionary, medical, scientific and homiletic literature. Much of this can be\ndone through conducting word-searches and using concordances in editions. (2)\nProviding extensive new information about Hildegard's sources that displays\nher use of internalized, memorized material in paraphrase. This task is\nessential, since no edition of the lyric songs has an adequate concordance, and\npreliminary research for this project has demonstrated the particularly\nstrong influence on her work of sources available to her from texts she had memorized in the monastic offices. (3) Analysing the persuasive structure of Hildegard's texts, covering the\nuse of imagery, the implicit arguments and emphases of the narration of St\nUrsula's legend, including the performative aspects. (4) Analysing the\nmusical settings using methods derived from musical pedagogy and theory that\nwere available to Hildegard. This analysis focuses on the points at which the\ntextual structure and musical structure suggest divergent emphases. (5)\nComparing the rhetoric of Hildegard's community with selected sources from\nother women's institutions of the same period. The test cases include the\nnearby convent of Klosterneuberg which produced a competing Ursula office\naround the same time and the more experimental liturgy devised at the\nParaclete by Abelard and Heloise.\n\nApplications and Benefits\nThere are very few studies of any lyric works of Hildegard that connect them\nsubstantively to her other works or to a demonstrable cache of memorized\nsources. Although there are isolated studies of individual pieces of\nHildegard (including several good studies of one of the items of the Ursula\noffice) there has been no study of the full office materials. Moreover,\nthere are few studies that undertake a complete rhetorical textual and\nmusical analysis of any of the thousands of surviving medieval offices. The\nmonograph arising from this research will therefore demonstrate the gains to\nbe made in understanding medieval modes of communication, representation and\nconfirmation of ideological positions through liturgical offices, one of the\nmost widely spread forms of mass communication of the middle ages. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12774</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Some media attention (Appearance on BBC R4 In our Time)</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1041C3FD-FC7A-474E-93E5-A492F7645A91</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G006261/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>61B990B8-E8CF-4876-B8AE-E00F07CCE8C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Church &amp; Theology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
