Understanding these functional associations requires knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the complex as this reveal the underlying molecular mechanism. However, determining experimentally the 3D structure of a protein complex present considerable difficulties. There is therefore a need for accurate and reliable computational methods. Several experiments have shown that protein interactions are critically dependent on just a few residues, or hot spots, at the binding interface. Hot spots make a dominant contribution to the free energy of binding and if mutated they can disrupt the interaction. In this project we aim to develop a computational method that can identify hot spot residues (and the contacts they form across the interface) in unbound proteins (i.e. without prior knowledge of the complex). This would significantly improve our ability at predicting the overall structure of the complex (the so-called docking problem). We plan to combine and integrate the basic energetic terms that contribute to the stability of protein complexes (e.g. van der Waals potential, hydrogen bonds,etc.) using state of the art machine learning techniques. In the first part of the project, we will develop a method to predict hot-spot residues at protein protein interfaces when the structure of complex is available. In the second part, we plan to systematically dock structural fragments of the two unbound proteins and test them for the presence of potential hot spots (using the classifier developed in the first part). Eventually, we will combine different sources of information (energetic, evolutionary and structural) to predict few important contacts across the interface of two proteins.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>310930</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The main non-academic impact from this grant has been the training of skilled scientific researchers.
