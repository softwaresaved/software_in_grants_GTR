The social, cultural and political import of this marginalisation remains under-examined, particularly within academic accounts of peace-building. This project seeks to redress the marginalisation of LGBTQ people in conflict transformation processes by providing them discursive and artistic fora to express their stories of political conflict, conflict transformation, and visions of peace. By analysing the processes, practices and outcomes of these expressions via the interdisciplinary application of methodologies across the arts, humanities and social sciences, the project seeks to address this critical gap in research and scholarship, at the same time generating an archive of reusable data and establishing transferable research models for use in other contexts wherein particular communities are marginalised in conflict transformation policies and processes.

A core aim of the project is to investigate the potential effects on the wider public of the embodied and visualised articulation of these stories and visions in the creative forms of theatre and photography. Performative and photographic practices have recently been successfully employed in storytelling initiatives to enhance cross-community relations in societies emerging from conflict; this project extends these researches to explore how artistic, cultural interventions by a marginalised and silenced community can help shape imaginings of a shared peaceful and inclusive future. The twin objectives of the project are therefore recognition of the histories and visions of LGBTQ people by the wider public and by policy-makers, and participation of LGBTQ people in framing broader visions of peace. The project is unique in its cross-disciplinarity, bringing together experts and practitioners in the fields of literary and gender studies, politics and conflict transformation, visual culture, photography, curating, applied drama, social work and community-building to address these key concerns. The innovative and highly collaborative nature of the project aims to stimulate creative interventions in the Northern Irish peace-building context by piloting a co-designed methodology that challenges the dominant frameworks in conflict transformation processes and research. The project aims ultimately not only to effect public perceptions of the LGBTQ community and its role in envisioning a peaceful future, but to extend that impact to policy-makers in Northern Ireland.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary

Beneficiaries: 
The beneficiaries of the research project include the LGBTQ community, LGBTQ advocacy groups, policymakers, the Arts industries, and the wider community in Northern Ireland. 

Summary of benefits
The LGBTQ community will benefit from a methodological approach that includes mechanisms for LGBTQ people's inclusion and active participation in shaping how a peaceful society is imagined in Northern Ireland. These visions will be disseminated in public and policy arenas connecting a community that has been marginalised by the dominant approaches to conflict transformation in the region to the policy-making community and the wider community in Northern Ireland. Through an analysis of LGBTQ people's visions of peace, the project will expose issues of marginalisation in conflict transformation policies and processes and will highlight the social and political benefits of including marginalised voices in imagining the 'peace' to policy-makers. The project will benefit the wider community by opening up dialogic space in the public arena for interrogations of the relationship between dominant and alternative visions of a peaceful society. A number of collaborating organisations have committed fully to the project creating strong research-stakeholder linkages that create concrete benefits for our collaborators (Belfast Exposed, TheatreofplucK, and Outburst) and routes for impact. For example, the project will award financial support for our collaborators to engage in the co-design of ground-breaking creative research, performances and exhibitions with the research team in a context characterised by unprecedented cuts to the Arts. Moreover, the project will enhance outreach opportunities for our collaborators and LGBTQ advocacy groups to engage with LGBTQ people on issues relating to conflict transformation processes and policies. It will provide data (participant testimonies, workshop feedback, and public questionnaire data), images and performance that can be used by LGBTQ advocacy groups to raise issues about LGBTQ people's inclusion in envisaging 'peace' in public and policy arenas. The project will benefit the Arts by highlighting its important role in representing marginalized voices and experiences in societies emerging from conflict which will encourage recognition of how the Arts not only benefits Northern Ireland's cultural economy but also its social development toward a peaceful future.

The Springboard Event was designed to inform the general public, NGOs and politicians about the aims and objectives of the research. In addition, the event housed within Northern Ireland's largest Queer Arts festival and hosted by Belfast Exposed Gallery was held to promote interest and participation in the research through an exploration of the role of creative methodologies in facilitating the expression of marginalised voices/perspectives in public spaces. 

Activities:
The event was opened by the Sinn F&amp;eacute;in deputy Lord Mayor of Belfast who discussed the place of the research in relation to issues of inclusion and equality in a society emerging from conflict. Each member of the research team outlined the methodological tools that would be utilized during the project to facilitate the creation of LGBTQ visions of peace through voice, image and performance. The event hosted art and discussion by Ciara Hickey (curator at Belfast Exposed), Niall Rea (director and founder of TheatreofplucK), Eoin Dara (curator at the MAC) and John O'Doherty (director of the Rainbow Project). All of the presenters provided concrete examples of how creative technologies can be utilized to support the dissemination of LGBTQ perspectives in public spaces. A question and answer session that was extended on the day enabled a public audience that included members of the LGBTQ community, NGOs, and politicians to learn about and discuss the aims and objectives of the project with the research team and project partners. 

Outcomes:
The event informed a public and political audience of the role of the creative arts in creating spaces for LGBTQ voices and perspectives; provided a discursive space to exhibit and share methodological tools designed to facilitate the expression of LGBTQ perspectives and histories; provided a networking opportunity for those interested in LGBTQ equality issues; generated many requests for information about forthcoming dissemination events.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://outburstarts.com/queer-visions-of-home/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Creative Workshops Information Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B762F4E6-5F93-433F-9DA6-444DF0C4F0E4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Purpose:
The information day was designed to enable potential participants to visit the venues where the creative workshops would be held, meet the facilitators and view some of the facilitators' work with LGBTQ people and groups. Moreover, the event enabled all potential participants to ask questions related to the creative workshops. 

Activities: 
The researchers identified the overarching themes that emerged in the focus groups to provide a basis for thinking through the next stage of the research. The creative workshop facilitators, Niall Rea (director Theatreofpluck) and the Australian artist Anthony Luvera (Coventry University) presented some key examples of their photography and theatre work with LGBTQ people. The facilitators also provided short taster sessions of the activities that would be used in the creative workshops in each of the venues. 

Outcomes:
All participants provided feedback that indicated that the event had given them greater insight into the methods that would be utilized in the workshops. In terms of those who attended a very high proportion requested a place in the creative workshops.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dissemination event housed within Imagine: Belfast Festival of Ideas &amp; Politics</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B66B030D-B240-4C8F-9BA7-BDE56053A1C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Purpose: 
The event was organised to disseminate the empirical data generated through the focus groups to a public/policy audience. Additionally, given the diversity of the audience that attends the Imagine: Belfast Festival it provided an opportunity to gain feedback from a range of stakeholders. 

Activity:
The event was advertised by Imagine: Belfast. Invitations were sent to all of the Northern Ireland political parties, selected NGOs and academics. Activities scheduled include a presentation of the aims, objectives and methodological framework of the research; dissemination of the initial research findings under a set of thematic headings; a Q&amp;amp;A session; and distribution of a briefing paper.

Outcomes: 
As detailed above the preparatory work for this event has been completed and the outcomes will be on-going. At this time, the outcomes of the event include: an invitation to present the initial research findings to Corrymeela, Northern Ireland's oldest peace and reconciliation organisation which is also a dispersed Christian Community. Northern Ireland politicians unable to attend the event have requested invitations to forthcoming dissemination sessions. The PI received an invitation to attend a Gender Identity Ireland Event. Dahlia Naji currently working for Swedish national television requested further information about the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://imaginebelfast.com/events-at-a-glance/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research data generated from a series of regional focus groups with LGBTQ and exclusively transgender support groups found evidence to suggest that the Northern Ireland conflict had reinforced and deepened the social inequalities experienced by these identities. The research found that the social conditions created by conflict had made it in the words of one study participant, 'difficult to exist as an LGBTQ person'. Participants recalled the reasons why many LGBTQ people left Northern Ireland during the conflict. There was a broad consensus that during the period of conflict transformation social attitudes to LGBTQ people had improved. However, participants believed that peace had not delivered the forms of security, equality and inclusion it seemed to promise for all citizens of Northern Ireland. While security increased for the wider population, LGBTQ people continued to experience different forms of insecurity. When study participants were asked about everyday life in the 'new' Northern Ireland wherein all identities were to have parity of esteem, fear and insecurity emerged as common themes. Study participants painted a picture of intermittent threats to their identities, their dignity and their security across a range of social spaces and institutions. Focus group data indicated a lack of confidence in the power-sharing institutions and in the reformed police service. The equality legislation ushered in after the 1998 Agreement was viewed as lacking practical application. Whereas the conflict had operated to create a hostile environment for LGBTQ people, the focus group data suggested that some LGBTQ people have been forced into developing fragmented identities in order to protect themselves from homophobia and trans-phobia. These individuals disclose or conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity depending on the context. Transgender individuals experience further problems. For example, some transgender individuals may find it difficult to conceal their gender identity leaving them vulnerable to a range of insecurities and inequalities. State intervention into family life and a lack of knowledge among healthcare professional were also key concerns for the transgender participants which demonstrated that there is a need to address the role of primary welfare agencies in reducing insecurity for transgender people during conflict transformation. Overall, the research found that the failure of the Northern Ireland Assembly to pass marriage equality legislation represents one manifestation of sexual and gender identity inequality in Northern Ireland. The peace process has delivered greater security, equity and inclusion for some citizens but peace-building has some considerable distance to travel in terms of ensuring that sexual and gender minorities can benefit from similar social changes. The research continues to explore the experiences of LGBTQ people in the context of peace-building in Northern Ireland and intends to apply additional methodologies to capture their perspectives on peace and to facilitate the expression of those perspectives in public/political spaces.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings map the inclusion/exclusion of minority sexual and gender identities from peace-building processes, practices and models which furnishes data for further inquiry by academics, policy-makers and civil society organisations.

The focus group methodology followed the ethical protocols approved by Ulster University and Queen's University. The PI conducted 14 focus groups between 30 August 2016 and 23 February 2017 with LGBTQ and transgender groups based in North Belfast, South Belfast, Enniskillen, Newtownabbey, the North West and Omagh. The recruitment of participants was facilitated through the Rainbow Project, Focus: The Identity Trust and was also promoted through dissemination events. Agreement to participate was lower than expected due to a decline in the number of people attending LGBTQ support/friendship groups in particular locations. Group facilitators attributed diminishing numbers to a lack of resources and/or fear that if a person was seen attending the group it might compromise their security. 

Each focus group employed a semi-structured discussion guide and lasted 1 hour 45 minutes on average. Age categories ranged from 20 years old to 70 years old. The discussion guide was adapted in relation to age, location and participant availability. Participant availability resulted in the number of focus groups conducted with each regional group ranging from 1-4. Data was recorded using a mix of note-taking and digital voice recording. Additional focus groups will be held throughout the duration of the project as the process of data analysis and interpretation continues. 

The focus group sessions covered the following thematic areas: 
(1) dominant and marginalised perspectives in envisaging peace
(2) the inclusion and exclusion of LGBTQ people in Northern Ireland society before the 1998 Agreement 
(3) the inclusion and exclusion of LGBTQ people after the 1998 Agreement 
(4) the role of the institutions established or reformed after the 1998 Agreement in creating LGBTQ inclusion and exclusion
(5) LGBTQ visions of an inclusive, peaceful society.

Findings:
During the focus groups LGB&amp;amp;Q participants discussed the questions in relation to sexual orientation, while transgender participants discussed the questions in relation to their gender identity. The data collected from the series of 14 focus groups indicated that before 1998 conservative social attitudes, conservative and often highly masculinised social institutions and the broader security situation had created an exceptionally difficult environment for LGBTQ people leading to feelings of social alienation, fear and insecurity. Focus group data indicated that from the perspective of LGBTQ people there had been advances in equality and social inclusion since the 1998 Agreement. However, participants also indicated that LGBTQ people had not gained equality or parity of esteem in terms of shaping the broader peace process. Focus group data indicated that LGBTQ people continue to experience homophobia and trans-phobia in their everyday lives. Focus group discussions suggested that LGBTQ people continue to experience discrimination in the labour market, the workplace, in churches, schools and in hospitals, and also in a variety of public spaces. In terms of the peace process the focus group data indicated that LGBTQ people view Northern Ireland as the least advanced region of the UK and as gradually falling behind the Republic of Ireland in terms of equality. 

Across the regional focus groups participants indicated a general lack of confidence in the capacity of key elements of the process of conflict transformation to create an inclusive and safe environment for LGBTQ people. Problems with policing, the persistence of paramilitary groups, the limitations of post-1998 equality legislation, and resistance to change by some politicians and civic society organisations were highlighted by the participants. Transgender people indicated additional issues relating to fear of social services, and a lack of understanding of transgender issues in the medical profession and in the broader society. A set of difficulties pertaining to the process of transition were also highlighted. 

The focus group data indicated that participants envisaged a peaceful society as one in which social groups that had experienced historical forms of discrimination would be given parity of esteem, security and full equality. Particular organisations in Northern Ireland were identified as engaged in creating new forms of inclusion/recognition and participants were keen to highlight the value they placed on those interventions. Self-help, lobbying and activism designed to create meaningful change emerged as the main 
road map for achieving these aspirations. The development of resilience and investments in supporting others characterized the focus group population. The participants stressed that their preferred strategy for removing barriers to equality, inclusion and parity of esteem was education and forms of lobbying.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E5662746-857F-463C-9614-A63156B754EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1) The database captured how LGBTQ people experienced additional forms of inequality and insecurity during political conflict and how those inequalities and insecurities have persisted in the conflict transformation period.

2) Due to the qualitative nature of the data, the research furnished examples of historical and more recent experiences of homophobia and trans-phobia highlighting core arenas of inequality and insecurity.

3) The data collected provides an empirical basis to make claims for peace-building policy and practice to engage more fully with LGBTQ issues and also provides a rationale for the greater inclusion of LGBTQ people's perspectives in peace building activities.

4) The data set provides empirical evidence of the role of LGBTQ individuals as agents of change during conflict transformation in Northern Ireland. 

5) The data captured a series of concrete recommendations by focus group participants for improving inclusion, security and equality for LGBTQ individuals.

6) The data indicates a need to conduct further research on LGBTQ people in societies emerging from conflict and highlights the need to promote informed and open policy discussions about the inclusion of issues of sexual orientation and gender identity in peace-building activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>LGBTQ Visions of Peace: Focus Group Data</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N008588/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6C41006C-514B-4763-BE82-812123897818</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>28E947B7-D5E4-4F18-9608-1A8534D290F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Peace Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1BF93D24-EF76-46A8-848B-CCD6008D74BC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Photography HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
