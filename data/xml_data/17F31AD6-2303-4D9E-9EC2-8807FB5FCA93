About 90% of the human population is right-handed which associates with a left hemisphere motor dominance, as each side of the brain controls movement of the opposite side of the body. In contrast to the strong movement-related capabilities of the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere is superior for spatially-related functions. This capacity is crucial when we for instance need to direct our attention to a particular location in space. Based on these distinctive functions, interactions between both sides of the brain are considered important to ensure unified motor behaviour. For example when drawing a complex geometric figure, the movement and spatial demands need to be accurately integrated to accomplish the task successfully. Despite our ability to produce skilled and adaptive motor actions, there are still many questions unanswered concerning the brain's processing capabilities to achieve this type of behaviour. Accordingly the present research proposal includes several studies that describe the neural circuits for the control of skilled movements. First it is aimed at assessing the neural organization that underlies hand skilfulness. This involves evaluating the learning-related changes when acquiring a new motor task from an unskilled to a skilled performance. It is argued that practice has an important impact on neural processing that is modified as skill proficiency increases. Furthermore the effect of attention upon the processing demands will be established. It is hypothesized that attention influences the neural circuitry associated with the task demands. Second it is aimed at investigating the distinctiveness of handedness in skilled actions, including the degree as well as the direction of handedness. In view of the degree of handedness the aim is to compare the neural networks that control the performance of the preferred vs. non-preferred arm, under normal and sensorimotor conflict conditions (i.e., in case of a mismatch between an intended and expected outcome, such as when incongruent visual information is provided during movement performance). It is argued that distinct neural processing underlies the performance of both arms, which will become most evident under incongruent sensorimotor situations. In view of the direction of handedness the aim is to contrast the neural circuits that regulate motor performance in various handedness groups (i.e., right- and left-handers). It is hypothesized that right- and left-handers will show different neural processing profiles. All studies in this research proposal include electroencephalography (EEG) techniques, which employs sensors (electrodes) placed on the scalp to pick up electrical activity generated by the brain. Subsequently advanced analysis of the EEG signals will assess the involvement of various brain regions and how they in-teract with one other in view of motor performance. It is believed that the outcomes of this work will advance our knowledge concerning the brain's circuits that underlie motor behaviour. Furthermore this assessment is also important to improve rehabilitation programs that could initiate new interventional techniques for enhancing functional benefits after brain damage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A superiority of the left hemisphere for movement organization is generally acknowledged. However functions directed by the right hemisphere such as spatial processing demands are also indispensable for a successful motor act. Hence it is argued that neural control of motor behaviour is achieved by means of interactive communication that involves both hemispheres and that is dynamically driven by task- and performer-related factors. The research proposal includes several studies that aim at exposing the neural dynamics that relate to the representation and regulation of skilled movement. First it is intended to assess the neural connectivity patterns that underlie manual skilfulness. This involves evaluating the learning-driven changes when acquiring a complex motor task from an unskilled to a skilled performance. Furthermore the influence of motor and spatial attention is evaluated, based on observations that a hemispheric dissociation of these attentional systems exists. Second it is aimed to determine the degree and direction of handedness by contrasting the neural circuits that guide motor performance of the preferred vs. non-preferred arm in right- and left-handers. All the studies in this research proposal take advantage of EEG technology. We specifically focus on the measurement of coherence, which provides a valuable analytical tool to investigate functional connectivity patterns across frequency bands. In addition cross-frequency analysis is applied to determine coupling between frequency bands. It is anticipated that the outcomes will enhance present insights into the neural organization of skilled actions and the processes that are instantiated in the brain-behaviour relation. Furthermore this knowledge is important to promote rehabilitation programs that take advantage of interhemispheric resources to reacquire, guide and reinforce movement capabilities. Overall these insights are decisive for theories of motor control in health and disease.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>295368</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>School of Physics and Astronomy Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Sir Peter Mansfield MR Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>Interactions between the cerebellum and cortical prefrontal regions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7E523FEC-FB71-4CD0-8CFE-B01790859A6F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multi-disciplinary collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Contributions to data analyses.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have collaborated with researchers from the MR Centre at the University of Nottingham in order to assess functional connectivity established at the cortical-subcortical level.

About 90% of the human population is right-handed which associates with a left hemisphere motor dominance, as each side of the brain controls movement of the opposite side of the body. In contrast to the strong motor-related abilities of the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere is superior for spatial-related functions. Based on these distinctive capabilities, information processing between both sides of the brain is important to ensure unified motor behavior. For example, when drawing a complex geometric figure, the motor and spatial demands require accurate integration in order to accomplish the task successfully. However, brain-imaging techniques have revealed that the brain's processing abilities during skilled performance are not fixed but flexible. The latter has been labelled as functional plasticity and reflects the ability of the brain to adapt to new tasks and variable environments. Moreover, the information processing activity of the brain can be amplified for example due to task complexity, be disturbed as a result of sensorimotor conflict (i.e., when invalid visual information is provided for movement performance) or be progressively adjusted such as during practice of a motor skill. Furthermore, an association between degree of neural processing and skill performance allows distinguishing between good vs. poor performers, which underlines that individual activity patterns play a prominent role in shaping behavioral success. In addition, performer-related adaptations also become evident when assessing left-handers who show neural processing that is not a mirror image from that observed in right-handers. Overall, the evidence from the current brain-imaging research illustrates that various internal and external factors shape brain regulation, resulting in a flexible and dynamic motor control system that assists the performance of skilled actions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have used this research in our outreach activities. (1) we were involved in the Summer Scientist week organized by the School of Psychology at the University of Nottingham (2011). During this week, children (3-11 years of age) perform various fun activities. We took the opportunity to develop enjoyable motor tasks in order to assess how children perform with one or both hands. (2) we contributed to the Aldeburgh festival of music and the arts (2010) with a piece on neural plasticity in musicians. In particular, the contribution describes the anatomical and functional plasticity that takes place during and following extensive musical practice. The outcomes of this research work enhance current knowledge about the neural dynamics of skilled actions and the mechanisms that underlie the brain-behavior association. The findings are also relevant for clinical purposes as pathology and developmental diseases have been linked to inconsistent hemispheric specialization, or, dysfunctional integration among neural systems. Furthermore, these results can contribute to the development of rehabilitation programs and intervention techniques that incorporate behavioral patterns to improve motor disability following neural damage. Overall, the insights resulting from this research add to the existing theories of motor control.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CE48FBF5-A73B-4807-AE82-597391A43D2B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities,
