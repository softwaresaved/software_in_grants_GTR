These include literary, sub-literary and documentary texts. To handle this mass of data with maximum efficiency we now propose to build Proteus, a system comprising of both an innovative digital editing and research tool for scholars working on unpublished papyri and a larger web portal devoted to literary and subliterary fragments (sub-classified for history, biography, and so on). We aim to produce a single on-screen interface to enable comparison between original and edited versions of literary and subliterary texts, and establish an online system that facilitates collaboration between scholars in the editorial process. Proteus' editing tool will change the way papyrologists and editors work, while its web portal, accessible to the world, will both instigate further research and provide an intelligent means of interfacing the conjectures and variant readings that these fragments generate as they are re-edited over time. Whilst constructing this tool, we will also produce a critical edition of Servius' commentary on Vergil Aeneid VI, serving as a prototype for subsequent digital critical editions of his commentary on other books of the epic. This prototype will offer a framework for creating digital editions of ancient commentaries in general, whose complex formatting require innovative ways of digital reading, something beyond the codex experience. Given the biographical and historical nature of many of the texts generated, we will also take the opportunity to update a seminal reference work devoted to fragmentary evidence: the Die Fragmente der Griechischen Historiker Continued. Part IV: Biography and Antiquarian Literature. 
 
The project will thus have five main outputs: 
1) The Proteus digital editing tool, through which scholars assigned to work on Oxyrhynchus papyri will edit their fragments and make them ready for print and digital publication.
2) The Proteus digital portal for searching literary and subliterary fragments and the collaborative re-editing of texts. We intend to immediately populate our site with 1,700 unpublished Bodleian papyri, 300 Antinoopolis papyri, and select unpublished Sackler papyri including Homer's Iliad and Homerica, Herodotus and the Septuagint.
3) The digital Servius environment: a prototype interface for digitally researching and creating digital editions of ancient commentaries. Servius' commentaries on Virgil's Aeneid book VI will become accessible online in the first instance. 
4) The imaging of hundreds of thousands more unstudied papyri from our archive for processing in Ancient Lives and Proteus.
5) Immediate updating of Die Fragmente der Griechischen Historiker Continued. Part IV: Biography and Antiquarian Literature with new fragments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will reach a wide-ranging audience, from school children to professional scholars. It is a digital environment designed to engage both traditional and non-traditional research communities. Its original point of interface, Ancient Lives, is a place where original documents, previously confined to the eyes of experts, are made available to the public through the use of a web interface: interested users go online, browse and access fragments of their choice, and contribute to the project by entering transcriptions, measurements and other information by means of online tools. The resulting data, collated and refined by algorithmic intelligence, will greatly contribute to our knowledge of the Graeco-Roman world. 
In capitalizing on our unique and massive database of unedited and unpublished Greek languages texts, we intend now to provide even greater open access to project output. The flow of data through Proteus represents a change in the very methodology of classical philology and papyrology. Scholars from anywhere in the world will be able to edit fragments with the assistance of intelligent linguistic data mining algorithms. This merging of human and machine intelligence is designed to speed up the process of analysis, while at the same time ensuring accuracy is retained. Moreover, Proteus' research and re-editing environment will offer global access to project output, a virtual place where any interested party can access and work with our data. With fragment numbers in excess of one million, and the subsequent data they generate, Proteus will never be static, but continually evolving and changing over time. Better still, for the hundreds of thousands of volunteers that have entered transcriptions on the Ancient Lives site, Proteus will also be the place where they can see the results of their work and even engage further, alongside the scholarly community, in its collaborative re-editing environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>452023</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Proteus and its new digital text editor (DELPHI) have created a simple and stable way for users to create born digital editions without engaging in any XML markup.

Still, in terms of development and cyber infrastructure, Proteus has not only achieved its key goals, but also continues to evolve. In developing a platform that digitally captures the evolving data of Greek and Latin literary and subliterary papyri as they are edited and re-edited over time, the Proteus project has created a digital ecosystem for both creating next-generation born digital critical editions and generating the textual criticism that underwrites them. 

The Proteus architecture consists of two components: the Digital Editor for Classical Philology (DELPHI) and the Proteus Search Interface. The project is implemented using Python, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, a PostgreSQL database management system, and Apache Solr for fast, powerful search functionality; these components are packaged together using Django, a high-level Web framework for the Python programming language.

Proteus offers a virtual space for parallel critical editing, a process whereby one or multiple scholars can produce a digital edition and even suggest conjectures through critical notes, all of which are then accessible for future research. Focusing on papyrus fragments in its first iteration, citable, scholarly use is of the utmost importance. But Proteus is not just simply implementing the necessary attributes that make a Greek or Latin edition critical, but embracing the machine for what it is: not a book. A new text editor, data visualization, search, and version control are being employed to re-think how a user interfaces a text that can constantly change. 

DELPHI

With DELPHI at the core of Proteus' digital ecosystem, this platform facilitates the creation of born digital critical editions. As a text editor DELPHI's design has been modeled on common Markdown editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDE). Our editor employs its unique Critical Syntax (CSYN) Markdown, a human-readable language for digital philology, alongside Critical Syntax for Papyri (CSYN-P), a modified and improved implementation of the EpiDoc XML schema; it also addresses the markup needs of Herculaneum papyri. In real-time, as users create digital editions using CYSN Markdown, CSYN-P is not only generated automatically, but also the HTML5 preview. DELPHI thus removes the labor-intensive process of XML markup (though a user can select to do so) and improves quality control, since syntactical errors are flagged and easily isolated via the real-time translation. More importantly, in this very same fashion, DELPHI allows editors to generate attributes that make an edition critical and thus citable in scholarship: a critical apparatus, testimonia, diplomatic editions, and even the palaeographical apparatus. Other highlights include: in-browser Greek keyboard and menus for inserting papyrological and critical symbols (no downloaded third party software or keyboards required); a diacritic menu inspired by the Apple OS X Character Accent Menu; JavaScript that makes data in the critical apparatus more engaging; and functionality for digitally editing marginalia and providing translations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Proteus and its new digital text editor (DELPHI) have created a simple and stable way for users to create born digital editions without engaging in any XML markup.

Instead of papyrus fragments, Proteus will soon be adapted to create born digital editions based on texts transmitted in Medieval Latin codices.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2B7BB903-13DF-4309-B162-86BCAAE9D31D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/ProteusProject/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Proteus website and its Digital Editor for Classical Philology (DELPHI) facilitate the creation of born digital critical editions.
