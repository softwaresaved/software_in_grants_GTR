They cannot be prevented but insurers can save both themselves and their customers costs and disruption by being well prepared and responsive. There is a need within the insurance industry to better control the effects of this peril through an understanding of its typical behaviour (climatology). Insurers have been unable to approach this question as it is considered too costly and speculative to access weather data for commercial use. Other projects have produced wind climatologies but have been based on models or proxies (rather than observations), have been too regional (a Europe-wide climatology is required as insurers often cover property across Europe) or have focussed on average conditions rather than extreme winds. The availability of an untapped, central resource for European wind observation data in the NERC BADC MIDAS dataset presents a unique opportunity to deliver novel research to benefit the research and insurance communities of the UK and Europe. The Mullard Space Science Laboratory at UCL has a strong track record of developing the results of NERC funded research projects into applications, such as those which ultimately led to the creation of EuroTempest Ltd (a novel weather information service to industry) in 2007 and the development of the successful UCL Global Drought Monitor. AIM AND OBJECTIVES 1. To develop a method which can accurately assess how frequently potentially damaging winds can be expected to occur at any chosen location in Europe. 2. To engage with the European insurance industry to secure the support and route to market of the method, both through its use and through further collaboration and development. We aim to: a) Create a set of European surface wind and gust observation data that are as accurate, cover as large an area, and for as long a time period, as is possible. b) Provide probability distributions for extreme winds for a number of European weather observation stations. c) Develop schemes for estimating probability distributions for extreme winds at any location in Europe. d) Produce clearly presented documents that explain methods, results, caveats and our recommendations for use. e) Maintain and increase the continued support and interest of industry contacts. f) Widen awareness of the project and its commercialization potential within the industry. g) Secure a route to the realization of the commercialization potential of the project. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS A windstorm climatology enables a full assessment of wind risk on a location by location basis and thus could inform: a) Wind warning and response systems In terms of impact, how unusual the wind is is of more utility than the value of the wind speed. By comparing wind forecasts/observations with climatology insurers could quickly assess this and accurately and objectively assess the likely impact on their customers. Warning and resource management systems based on climatology would therefore enable a more informed and efficient response to extreme wind events. b) Insurance Pricing A windstorm climatology would allow insurers to more accurately price the risk from wind. c) Development and assessment of catastrophe Bonds Catastrophe Bonds are a form of alternative risk transfer used in the reinsurance market. They are typically triggered from an index which is a weighted average of wind speeds at locations across Europe. The weighting applied at each location is in large part a function of the risk posed by extreme wind, or the wind climatology. d) Other industries e.g. Construction. Many construction contracts allow for delays due to 'exceptionally inclement weather'. A windstorm climatology would allow for an assessment of when winds are 'exceptional'. It could also assist at the planning stage, in determining the likelihood and length of delays due to exceptional winds.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100714</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Finance and Business Affairs All Staff Meeting at University College London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DDE5589A-D6E8-4482-8C64-CA5A73C8EDFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave 30 minute presentation to the Finance and Business Affairs All Staff Meeting at UCL on &amp;quot;UK windstorm gust mapping at high resolution&amp;quot;.

NERC funding has contributed to this development through a 12-month Follow-on-Fund grant in 2011 which initiated research in developing an extreme wind climatology, and through a Big Data co-award in 2013 which paid for a Met Office licence to commercially exploit the underpinning UK station gust data. Substantial further development work between 2012 and present has been funded by Professor Saunders using commercial licence returns from a separate project. This work has contributed to the development of the following innovative features which underpin the technology: (1) a 100-year UK wind dataset (this involving considerable digitisation of historical station gust data stored in the Met Office archives); (2) a state-of-the-art 100-year catalogue of UK windstorms; (3) the capability to correct for orographic effects at 100m spatial resolution via application of the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations for boundary layer flow. It should be noted that the Follow-on award in 2011 experienced substantial unexpected problems. These included the project's earmarked data being inadequate for purpose and the original proposal not recognising either the important influence on peak gust of upstream topography or the need for significant funds to pay for a commercial licence to exploit the underpinning Met Office data. These difficulties have now all been overcome and the resulting technology is of higher quality than envisaged in 2011.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings/research are being taken forward through the final development and commercialisation of four UK windstorm products, as follows:

Product 1: A catalogue of historic UK wind events occurring between 1914 and 2013. The catalogue includes all storms where at least one station records a peak 3-sec gust with a return period of at least 2-years.
Product 2: Gust wind speeds by return period on a high spatial resolution (100m) grid.
Product 3: A UK windstorm risk map or index on a 100m grid.
Product 4: Gust footprints for historic windstorm events on a high resolution (100m) grid.

These products are designed primarily for the UK (re)insurance industry but may also have application to transport, forestry and power and energy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>35CEC307-6902-405F-9A89-FD0AF5AEB081</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Energy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A 100 year (1914-2013) database of hourly peak 3-sec gust observations from UK weather stations has been created for all storms where at least one station records a peak 3-sec gust having at least a 2-year return period normalised to 1981-2010.

SSI was introduced by Lamb (1991) for ranking storms in terms of their potential overall damage. The catalogue uses peak 3-sec gusts from six core weather stations supplemented with peak gusts from secondary weather stations. Corrections are made for the bias introduced when a station anemometer changed type from a Dines pressure tube to an electrical cup generator. SSI values are computed using two different formulas - one using the cube of the gust speed, the other using gust speed to the power of seven (this latter determined using actual UK storm loss data).</gtr:description><gtr:id>35C4A618-65E9-4B8E-A3B2-0C9468B8DDFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The database will be a useful resources to academia and to industries such as (re)insurance by allowing users to characterise extreme Southeast UK storms and to validate climate and catastrophe models.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Southeast UK windstorms 1914-2013 ranked by storm severity index</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This state-of-the-art catalogue lists all UK windstorm events occurring between 1914 and 2013.

1. UK hourly weather data (http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ukmo-midas/WH_Table.html) for the two parameters: hourly 10-min wind speed and 
 hourly 10-min wind direction. 1950-2013.
 
2. UK Mean Wind Data (http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ukmo-midas/WM_Table.html) for the parameter: hourly maximum 3-sec gust speed. 
 1950 - 2013.

The cleaning has involved correcting mistyped data entries and removing erroneous and duplicate data records. Nearly 4000 wind and gust records in the NERC BADC MIDAS data have been corrected. Three corrections have been made to homogenise the MIDAS UK station gust records. These corrections are: (1) The location of 282 MIDAS stations have been determined to 10m precision; (2) Gust data imputation has been performed to give complete 45-year hourly and daily maximum gust coverage at 282 stations; (3) The effective heights of the MIDAS 3-sec gust recordings have been standardised to 10m where possible.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4E26FE31-0C57-4957-8C44-1A4573AB2B55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These cleaned and homogenised data have contributed to the development of UK windstorm products which are being offered for licencing to the UK insurance industry.
