In return for disclosure of an invention, the state grants a monopoly to the patent holder. Whilst patents may work as intended to provide that incentive to innovation, patents may also work against the public interest by reducing public access to technology, or by shaping the development of technology in inappropriate ways.

The intersection of patent law with modern innovation such as genomics poses particular challenges, and the traditional principles of law are being strained almost to breaking point by patents claiming the very building blocks of life itself. Despite the publicly funded nature of this research, technologies in this area, and many genes themselves, are the subject of patent rights, and the patent owner has the potential to control the development of, and access to, the technology in question. At the same time, medicine is failing to accommodate patent rules, and there is divergence between law and practice.

Through the Human Genome Project and continuing research, we now have the most detailed map to date of the information programmed in our DNA - the information that makes us who we are. DNA abnormalities can lead to many common conditions such as Down's Syndrome and Cystic Fibrosis, and we are currently able to diagnose these conditions in adults by genetic tests, or in unborn children by testing foetal tissue. Soon, we will be able to diagnose disorders, and decipher a baby's entire genetic make-up by the simple procedure of analysing a sample of blood from a pregnant woman; a process called Non-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis (NIPD), which will revolutionise the clinical management of pregnancy worldwide. 

Understanding how patents in this field in Britain, Europe and the USA are enforced, and how companies, healthcare organisations and individuals interact with the system, is important to facilitate the development of, and public access to, NIPD. Perhaps more importantly, this research, and previous work of the PI investigating patents in single gene testing will be used as case studies to explore the wider issues surrounding the translation of innovations in genomic medicine into clinical practice. How patent law operates in practice has implications for delivery of technologies to the public, how companies and researchers innovate, how individuals decide to act, and how healthcare evolves in the face of emerging research that promises to change the face of medicine. The research will further make an important contribution to patent law scholarship, by an empirically informed conceptualisation of the role of patents in practice in frontier technologies.

The applicant has extensive experience in the legal issues surrounding genomic medicine. She will employ and develop socio-legal research methods to develop a theory of the role that patents play in emerging fields of genomic medicine, and foster improved international awareness and discussion of the subject. She will interview the leading international players in the field, as well as investigating the relationships between them through social network analysis. The analysis will be used to tease out how an appreciation of patents shapes day-to-day practice and future direction in translational research in NIPD. 

This work is necessary to protect the interests of the public without impinging on innovation in the private sector. This project investigates an emerging and relatively young aspect of law which is set to become much more important as genomic medicine becomes a routine part of medical practice and as other frontier technologies challenge patent law in practice. Little legal work has been done in the area - this project will strengthen the applicant's position as a future leader in the field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Patents are an integral part of western systems of technology innovation, but law can lag behind practice given the length of time it takes for patents to be granted, and for the resolution of contested litigation. However, empirical investigation in this field is rare. Therefore, this research will be vital to bring an empirically informed perspective to consideration of patent law in practice, which has implications for changing policy and practice around innovation.

Innovation is important for the realisation of public benefit from research as well as economic benefit in all fields, and particularly in medicine. Genomic medicine is anticipated to become an integral part of medical practice in the near future, and the process of translating innovation into routine clinical care is important for the health of the population. The research in this project will be of benefit to those who are involved in the translational research pathway for innovations in diverse fields, and particularly genomic medicine. Ultimately, it is anticipated that the research will benefit the public, and particularly patients, because the purpose of this research is to uncover the role that patents play in the translational process, and make recommendations to address any negative impact. The impact will be attained through changes to policy and practice at relevant points in the translational pathway. 

The research will have impact through its relevance to three broad groups: those who are actively involved in developing and delivering patented technology; policy makers; and finally those who are involved in 'using' patented technology.

Development and delivery of patented technology: This group incorporates scientists (both research and commercial), as well as professional advisors to those developing technology. It is anticipated that this research will have impact through informing professional advisors (lawyers, patent attorneys and technology transfer professionals) of the ways in which patents influence the translational process beyond what they are aware of through their professional experience, such that they improve or develop their professional practice. Similarly, scientists and companies developing tests will be informed by the research in ways that will permit them to organise their technology development and licensing in a more appropriate way to maximise health outcomes as well as economic competitiveness.

Policymakers: The research results enable policymakers, including funding bodies, to arrange the licensing of technology, for optimum health outcomes and economic competitiveness. Funding bodies are concerned to maximise the health benefits of the research they fund, and at the same time to contribute to the economic competitiveness of the UK, and this research will neatly fit with this agenda. 
User groups: This research will achieve impact in user groups, including medical professionals and patients partly through the impact on the previous two groups of stakeholders, which will ultimately improve the delivery and availability of genomic medicine. In addition, impact will be achieved through engagement with medical practitioners to raise awareness of the relevance and role of patents in the translational research process, in order that their medical practice is influenced by appropriate clinical considerations rather than invisible or inappropriate patent concerns. Interest groups, including genetic and disability interest groups are often involved in translational research for the benefit of their population, and have a keen interest in intellectual property and its uses and implications. This research will inform and improve these practices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>176837</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7566A7EC-ABA6-4BD0-856F-928E3B8F7D55"><gtr:id>7566A7EC-ABA6-4BD0-856F-928E3B8F7D55</gtr:id><gtr:title>A red herring: invalidity of human gene sequence patents</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Intellectual Property Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d6226a01afad6dca0d94ff41cb28c45d"><gtr:id>d6226a01afad6dca0d94ff41cb28c45d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>N Hawkins</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K009575/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
