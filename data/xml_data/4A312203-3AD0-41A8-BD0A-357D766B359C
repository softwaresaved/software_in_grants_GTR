&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>to identify the pattern of evolution of nationalist movements in Spain in terms of a series of dynamics (interaction with central government, pressures from the support bases of nationalist parties, competition between parties within the home region, transversal influence across regions and international influences)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to compare and contrast the experience of Basque and Catalan nationalist parties in respect of competing trends towards radicalisation, on the one hand, and territorial accommodation, on the other. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The principal focus is on the period since 1993, which has seen examples both of nationalist parties collaborating at the parliamentary level with Spanish socialist and conservative governments and of mainstream nationalist parties asserting rights to Catalan and Basque sovereignty and self-determination.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />The project will make extensive use of interviews with practitioners and experts involved in nationalist politics in Spain, in addition to archival and survey material. Apart from fieldwork, two workshops are envisaged with relevant experts and stakeholders, one in Spain and the other (with a comparative focus) in the UK. A linked PhD studentship, in the context of the North-West Doctoral Training College, focuses on the role of nationalist politicians elected to the Spanish Parliament.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will be of benefit to national policy makers and analysts engaged in plans to reform existing devolved structures of government, for it will provide some of the context that they need to interpret the behaviour of nationalist movements, especially regarding the dynamics behind the demands they make, the acceptability of reform ideas in ethnically-mixed communities and the broader viability of reforms. It will shed light on circumstances in which nationalist movements may become drawn into attempts at long-term, stable territorial accommodation and alternatively may come to adopt more radical agendas. 

There is some tendency among policy makers to judge nationalist movements on the basis of party leader discourses and actions, whereas this project will encourage a wider focus of analysis seeing leadership initiatives in the context of the diverse dynamics affecting communities where 'plurinationalism' exists. In this way, the envisaged benefits will be found in the effectiveness of devolution policy and more general management of centre-periphery relations, by helping to identify formulas that meet with a critical mass of acceptance and legitimacy in regions where the issue of decentralization currently divides populations, notwithstanding the prevalence of dual identities.

Through the importance of public policy, the project will have an impact also on issues of general wealth and culture, given the potential of excessive devolution formulas to generate administrative dysfunctionality and economic inefficiency, and for radicalisation to polarise societies, deter financial investment and bring demographic loss through emigration from regions (as in the Basque case).

Within the UK, non-academic beneficiaries are expected to be found in the Cabinet Office (in relation to the Structural Reform Plans adopted in July 2010) and in the Ministry of Justice with its interest in strengthening democracy and modernizing the Constitution. In Spain, they will be found in the Moncloa (PM's Office), the Ministry of Territorial Policy and Public Administration and Ministry of the Interior, as well as among nationalist and regional political elites. They will also be found in the European Commission (DG Regional Policy) and the European Parliament.

A specific impact will be the encouragement of policy learning, notably between the Spanish and UK cases, building upon the initiative of former Scottish Secretary John Reid who visited Spain for this purpose in May 2000. Both states face demands from within nationalist movements for referenda to be held on sovereignty issues, as a result of pressures within or upon nationalist parties for such consultations to take place. So far the transnational comparative perspective has been largely absent from policy debates about how to respond to such pressures.

A further impact would be to encourage transversal, comparative analysis of devolution across regions, not only among policy makers but also among experts. Dedicated think tanks and research centres in regions have a strong tendency to focus on their own specific (Basque, Catalan) case. Cases in point here include the Institut d'Estudis Autonomics in Barcelona and the Instituto Vasco de Administracion in Vitoria.

Such benefits from the research would begin to have impacts very quickly since the envisaged workshops would involve practitioners as well as fellow researchers and thus the outcomes would reach some beneficiaries even before research articles began to disseminate research findings through journal articles. An electronic newsletter would be used to communicate with those interested in the research findings. These are of immediate interest to user groups, owing to 'second round' devolution already being high up on government agendas in several European countries, or being temporarily placed on hold in the context of recession, thus affording an opportunity for further consideration before reforms are undertaken.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>182989</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aberystwyth University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of International Politics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Anwen Elias on 'Transforming Politics in Spain'</gtr:description><gtr:id>BEC8C2BA-3C49-493F-811C-19199586AC30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop on 'Transforming Politics in Spain' will be held at the University of Liverpool in June 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>We are designing and developing this project together and funding contributions will be made by both HEI's, but Dr Elias has also made a funding application to the University Association for Contemporary European Studies.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration on research project on the current process of political, economic and cultural transformation in Spain, initially by organising a workshop in Liverpool in June 2016, leading to journal articles, blogs and other publications.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newspaper article in 'El Pa?s'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A3CD4D3-8AB6-4743-B2DA-5A9AFA45C48C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article formed part of a special section of the newspaper devoted to referenda and it drew a lot of interest from readers.

To this end, I made a presentation to the Committee on Self-government of the Basque Parliament in Vitoria in April 2015, analysing the significance of the Scottish referendum for public consultations in Spain about shared-sovereignty proposals for the Basque Country and Catalonia. This, together with elite interviewing of representatives of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), the involvement of former Basque president Juan Jos&amp;eacute; Ibarretxe in a conference in Liverpool, and the participation of the PNV's international secretary I&amp;ntilde;aki Goikoetxeta in a project workshop, has led to strong interest within the principal party of government in the Basque Country. The PNV executive has translated several of the papers in which the research findings of the project have been presented and has discussed them internally. Feedback was subsequently given to me by a member of the party's international department, J M Etxebarria.
Further evidence of impact in the Basque political community is provided by the publication by the Treasury and Finance Department of the Basque province of Bizkaia/Vizcaya of the doctoral thesis, 'Nationalist Politics and Regional Financing Systems in the Basque Country and Catalonia' by Caroline Gray, who was supervised by me during the period of the project.
There has been strong demand for analysis by me of the movement for independence in Catalonia and Spanish management of the issue. Over the last two years, four contributions have been commissioned from me and published in the Oxford Analytica Daily Brief, whose mission statement is to deliver 'timely, impartial and actionable analysis of emerging trends and developments in the global political economy' and which reaches subscribing clients in the UK and across the globe in both private and public sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1855A667-90FB-4163-9C2C-475CFC42BD27</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In terms of the dynamics driving the territorial agendas of the leading nationalist parties in Catalonia and the Basque Country, centre-periphery tensions remain fundamental but have been exacerbated by globalization processes (external pressures on Spain to recentralize during the recession; Europeanization leading Spain to adapt to the EU regulatory context). Immigration has not been a central consideration in the adoption of sovereignty-based strategies, although its greater scale in Catalonia has contributed to parties seeking enhanced competences and resources with a view to improving its management. In the Basque case, the radicalization of territorial demands was fuelled significantly too by a desire to bring an end to conflict, with the mainstream nationalist party pushing for more autonomy in order to leave ETA without arguments to justify violence. 

While Basque and Catalan nationalist parties are alike in terms of party family, the features of their home regions differ, with consequences for the evolution of territorial agendas. The more complex, politically decentralized nature of the Basque Country has made it harder for the Basque Nationalist Party to pursue a single, consistent territorial agenda, since perceptions of party interest depend partly on locality and province as well as broader interests. However, the same feature represents a challenge for Spanish hopes of achieving a stable territorial settlement. A more centralized governance structure in Catalonia has facilitated nationalist party cohesion: pro-sovereignty shifts there were undertaken by a more thoroughly radicalized party (Democratic Convergence), influenced as well by active and eventually massive civil society mobilization. The role of civil society was much more limited in the Basque Country where decades of political violence had tended to produce polarization and inhibition.

Of greater relevance than initially expected, the different fiscal frameworks governing the Basque Country and Catalonia have tended to constrain sovereignty demands in the former while persuading traditionally moderate Catalan nationalists to seek independence. At the same time, the substantial fiscal autonomy achieved by the Basques has generated a bilateral relationship with Madrid that nationalists now wish to generalise in other domains; thus the aspiration to co-sovereignty persists.

While analysis of context and structures-including that of electoral competition and intra- nationalist outbidding tendencies-goes a long way towards explaining the evolution of nationalist parties, policy agency is a largely neglected field of research which this project, involving some 130 interviews with Catalan and Basque participants, has highlighted. The nationalist shift towards sovereignty-based demands was more of a top-down process in the Basque than in the Catalan case, where a longer period in opposition combined with pressures from civil society produced more pervasive radicalisation within the party.

The project found very little comparative research on nationalist parties being undertaken in Spain. It promoted this itself by organizing two workshops, since when some of the participants have embarked upon joint projects. It is hoped that the mostly comparative publication outputs from the project (including a journal special issue/book, at least five journal articles, a doctoral thesis and research briefs) will further promote comparative analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. We have identified and compared the precise drivers influencing the behaviour of nationalist parties in the Basque Country and Catalonia with regard to the strategic emphasis they adopt within a continuum extending from accommodationist behaviour to sovereignty-based governance formulas. Providing that differences in context are taken account of, the same drivers should be tested for in other (particularly European) countries where nationalist parties have seen shifts over time in their territorial agendas.

2. The project paid special attention to the implications of the EU framework for the realisation of sovereignty-based party objectives. It has shed light on the learning process experienced by pro-European nationalist parties at the European level, challenging earlier claims that frustration here tends to make nationalist parties revert to regionalization strategies.
