The development of renewable energy processes will require the collective force of scientists from all backgrounds, but chemistry in particular will play a leading role in creating the necessary materials for new energy technologies. The aim of my research programme is to develop innovative catalysts for hydrogen production. Hydrogen is one of the most promising alternate fuel sources, with regard to environmental factors and energy efficiency. Importantly, this fuel source can be produced from two abundant resources, water and sunlight. However, hydrogen production still remains one of the more obstinate chemical reactions; the chemistry involves a multi-electron process associated with large energy barriers, requiring an effective catalyst to drive the associated reaction. The catalysts presently available for hydrogen production are far too inefficient and costly, discouraging further investment in hydrogen-based technologies. In the proposed research, an innovative approach is used to design an entirely new class of inorganic catalysts able to circumvent the difficulties associated with multi-electron reactions and optimized for hydrogen production. The proposed catalysts employ inexpensive, abundant metals, providing a sustainable solution for fuel technologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of the proposed research project is to develop efficient and inexpensive catalysts for hydrogen production. The research is an essential component for the realization of a hydrogen economy, with wide-reaching environmental, political and economical consequences. 

Hydrogen presents an ideal alternative to fossil fuels: its benefits include a high energy density by mass and emission-free consumption. Governments worldwide have supported investments alongside the private sector, including the auto and oil industries, to advance the infrastructure required for a hydrogen economy. In the UK, a 'hydrogen highway' is under development in Wales and hydrogen-powered public transportation is being explored, e.g. the recent launch of the hydrogen-powered Ferry in Bristol. Small UK-based automotive companies as well as leading international car manufacturers have produced hydrogen powered cars for the UK market, while gas and oil industries have supported the construction of hydrogen filling stations. These developments are largely driven by targets for emissions cuts. However, the greatest advantage of hydrogen lies in its role as a solar fuel, allowing us to harness the power of the sun. The potential production of hydrogen from water, using sunlight, signifies a truly sustainable energy source. Thus, a hydrogen economy not only has environmental benefits, but affords the most promising path to renewable energy and energy independence.

While the few examples of hydrogen highways and cars have been well-publicised, the evolution of hydrogen technologies has fallen well short of initial expectations. Progress has been hindered largely by the cost and capability of the associated technologies. The current catalysts for hydrogen production are prohibitively expensive and far too inefficient to be viable. The proposed research project will focus on the development of affordable, high-rate catalysts for hydrogen production, thereby eliminating a major obstruction to the use of hydrogen as a fuel source. The research will have a substantial impact on numerous areas of science, as these catalysts are integral to the function of fuel cells and solar fuel technologies. Thus, the research provides valuable opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations, across the physical sciences, biosciences and engineering, to develop complete systems for solar fuel production and distribution. The research also has potential for high impact beyond academia. The development of cost-effective, practical hydrogen production catalysts will encourage further commercial and public sectors investment in hydrogen-powered vehicles and infrastructure. The project thus represents keystone research en route to cleaner fuels and renewable energy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99976</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J014435/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
