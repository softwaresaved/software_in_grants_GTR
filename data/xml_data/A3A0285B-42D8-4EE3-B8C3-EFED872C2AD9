On the other hand, formal computations done in particle physics agree with experiment to an enormous accuracy. This leaves mathematicians with a great challenge and the current proposal is a part of a larger research program, meant to address it.

The aim of this project is to investigate certain algebraic structures that recently were postulated as a robust conceptual basis for QFT and to use the examples provided by QFT models to prove new results concerning these structures. Subsequently, these new mathematical tools will be used to understand the formal computations done in physics (with the use of perturbation theory). The long term goal is to get enough control on the algebraic structures in question to enable one to go beyond perturbation theory and obtain rigorous results.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research project that I propose concerns very fundamental questions regarding the conceptual basis of quantum field theory (QFT). Research into the foundations of QFT is important for proper understanding of the laws of physics at the level of the smallest constituents of matter. My research is also related to quantum cosmology and quantum gravity, areas that are key to understanding the beginning of the Universe.

While the main direct impacts of this research will be to academic beneficiaries, there will also be benefits to society. In the long term, these benefits will be in the form of advancing knowledge and understanding of the world we live in and of our origins and place in the history of the Universe. In the shorter term, I will deliver societal impact by bringing the results of the cutting edge research in cosmology and quantum gravity closer to the public. I believe that it is important that the general public is informed about the newest results in fundamental research by people personally involved in it. Throughout the funding period I will also organize a series of activities for Sixth Form students aimed at raising their awareness of fundamental research in particle physics, cosmology and quantum gravity (all related to my own work). Details on how I plan to deliver these impacts are given in Pathways to Impact. 

My research project will also deliver impact in the form of training. Currently I supervise one Ph.D. student and co-supervise another. If the current proposal is successful, the Mathematics Department will offer a full Ph.D. studentship starting during the funding period. The Ph.D. student whom I will recruit will be working on a topic related to the proposed research. More details about a potential Ph.D. research project are given in the section DQ.S. in Case for Support. QFT is a very broad and diverse subject that involves methods from various different areas of mathematics. We ensure that our Ph.D. students become highly skilled, developing in areas such as: an ability to learn new mathematical methods quickly, creative problem solving, computation using algebraic manipulation software, critical thinking, and teamwork (by working as a part of a larger collaboration). Such transferrable skills will make these students highly valuable in both academia and in business.

Finally, this research project will ensure that the UK maintains a world-class reputation in the area of QFT, making it an attractive destination for both students and academics. In particular, I will work on raising the profile of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78543</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P021204/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
