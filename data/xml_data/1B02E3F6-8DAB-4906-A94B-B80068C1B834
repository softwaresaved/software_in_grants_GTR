These ephemeral structures we would often decorate with shells gathered from the foreshore. Sometimes luck prevailed and we found opened shells but more than likely we would scavenge and find mussels attached to nearby rocks. In Scottish waters these were more than likely the common blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, which, should we try and open them or smash them with a rock, we would find quite resilient, tough. This resilience is due to the unique shell structure laid down by the mollusc as it grows. How it does this is by recruiting certain proteins, unique to molluscs, to convert the basic shell material, calcium carbonate, into ordered layered structures. If you look at the external surface of the mussel it is rough and with a bit of effort you may be able to dislodge some of the surface coat. However, if you look at the inside of the shell there is a pearlescent material, called nacre, which is many times tougher than the outer coat. By cutting the shell in a specific direction and using an electron microscope to look in great detail at the arrangement of this calcium carbonate we find two forms (called polymorphs) - calcite on the outer layer and aragonite in the inner (nacre) layer. Although calcite readily forms from calcium carbonate in the laboratory, aragonite is a high-pressure polymorph which, as the name suggests, requires high pressure for the tougher form to be produced. A good analogy is that aragonite is to calcite as diamond is to graphite / both materials are made from the same chemical elements, but have quite different characteristics. The purpose of this project is to determine how the humble sea mollusc produces calcite and aragonite at ambient temperature and pressure, a feat that is not possible under normal laboratory conditions. To do this we have to examine both the shell architecture and also the proteins that may be recruited to accomplish this production of calcite and aragonite. The shell architecture will be looked at in fine detail by using two techniques / scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD). This will allow us to see this arrangement of calcite and aragonite within the shell. Simultaneously, we will look at a number of proteins that are found in the extrapallial (EP) fluid / which is found between the nacre layer and the soft (edible) part of the mussel and is easily extracted with a syringe. This EP fluid, which contains a number of different proteins, is thought to be the source of proteins needed to carry out the transformation from calcite to aragonite. In this project, several of these individual proteins will be isolated from the EP fluid and used to determine exactly which ones influence this change from calcite to aragonite. SEM and EBSD will be used to follow the growth of calcite/aragonite in a laboratory environment and hence we can determine which proteins cause the switch. Within the EP fluid there is one protein that stands out more than all the others and we will investigate this protein first since this is the most likely candidate for transformation. The most exciting way to do this is to determine its 3-D structure by using X-ray diffraction, a technique that the protein group in Glasgow excels. By knowing the structure we can determine how it works. So, what good is all this? Well, two important aspects: firstly, if you can control this switching you can sequentially lay down different layers on a number of different substrates (which we will also investigate). There is evidence that the aragonite nacre could potentially be exploited in the stimulation of bone production in osteoporosis for example if synthetic nacre could be provided in a suitable form. Secondly, the physical characteristics (extreme hardness) of aragonite nacre could also be exploited in a number of ways / protection for fragile surfaces and humans.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The ability of simple marine bivalves to control calcium carbonate polymorph production forming calcite and the high-pressure polymorph, aragonite, will be investigated. Central to this control are specific proteins that catalyse nucleation and growth, inducing polymorph switching and inhibition of growth. The influence of individual extrapallial fluid (EP) proteins on number, size and crystallography of in vitro calcium carbonate crystals (Kitano protocol) will be assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to monitor the effect that pure, well characterised proteins have on crystal growth in vitro. Those EP proteins (+/- carbohydrate) that influence calcium carbonate growth will be fully characterized with the ultimate aim of determining the conditions for crystallization allowing the elucidation of their three-dimensional structures. Protein purification by ammonium sulphate cuts, ion exchange and gel filtration using AKTA FPLC. Protein crystallisation trials by robotic screening employing Hamilton microlab star &amp;amp; Cartesian nano-drop dispenser with protein crystals produced analysed for suitability using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer. With pure proteins from two species of bivalve molluscs, Mytilus edulis and Modiolus modiolus, that have different shell morphology (ratio of calcite to aragonite), we shall begin to characterise those proteins that influence polymorph switching by 2-D gel electrophoresis (GE) and peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI or ESI (University of Dundee). Nano-fabrication will employ electron beam lithography and dry etching to form nano-patterns in calcite and chitin into which these pure proteins can be introduced sequentially to assess the feasibility of the production of layered interconnected calcite-aragonite structures of predetermined shape and material properties.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>331104</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Two important main outcomes from this research:

The innovative use of microfluidics to follow the effect of a number of biomineral proteins on polymorph formation has already been used by other groups.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E6F65D8D-C13C-4167-B7EC-F136236B4B07</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As children we all looked forward to our beach holidays, playing in the sand, building castles. These ephemeral structures we would often decorate with shells gathered from the foreshore. In UK waters these are likely to be the common blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, which, should we try to break them, we would find them quite resilient. This resilience is due to the unique shell structure laid down by the mollusc as it grows. It does this by recruiting certain proteins, to convert the basic shell material, calcium carbonate, into ordered, crack-resistant, layered structures. If you look at the external surface of the mussel you see that it is rough, and with a bit of effort you may be able to dislodge some of the surface coat. However, if you look at the inside of the shell there is a pearlescent material, called nacre, which is many times tougher than the outer coat. In fact nacre is quite a remarkable material: it is exceedingly light and stronger than either bone or teeth. By cutting the shell in a specific direction and using an electron microscope to look in great detail at the arrangement of this calcium carbonate we find two forms (called polymorphs) - calcite on the outer layer and aragonite in the inner (nacre) layer. Although calcite readily forms from calcium carbonate in the laboratory, aragonite is a high-pressure polymorph, which, as the name suggests, requires high pressure for this tougher form to be produced. A good analogy is that aragonite is to calcite as diamond is to graphite - both materials are made from the same chemical elements, but have quite different characteristics. 
To understand how all this is accomplished; we examined the shell architecture and the proteins that may be recruited to synthesise calcite and/or aragonite. This allowed us to see the precise arrangement of calcite and aragonite within the shell. Simultaneously, we looked at a number of proteins found in the extrapallial (EP) fluid, which is found between the nacre layer and the soft (edible) part of the mussel and extracted by syringe. EP fluid is the source of proteins needed to make either calcite or aragonite. We are experts at isolating and purifying proteins.Proteins, once isolated from their natural media, quickly denature and lose their effectiveness. To solve this problem we developed, as part of the project, lab-on-a-chip expertise (sometimes called microfluidics) to investigate the role of individual proteins on calcium carbonate polymorph formation. Lab-on-a-chip experiments take about 60 seconds and use only a few microlitres of protein. Compare this to overnight experiments and tens of ml of protein used by conventional methods.
The project has been a resounding success on a number of important fronts. Firstly, we have isolated and purified 5 significant proteins from the EP fluid. Secondly, the development of lab-on-a-chip, although initially time consuming, has advanced our understanding of which of these proteins influence carbonate polymorphism. This approach has been so successful that we have commissioned the transcript of the genome for this mussel. This will allow future work to be more easily pursued. 
So, what good is all this? Well, three important aspects: firstly, we are getting closer to determining which of Nature's proteins allows us to make aragonite at room temperature and pressure and therefore we can make very lightweight materials with incredible strength - imagine the uses that you could put this new material to. Secondly, if you can control this polymorph switching you can sequentially lay down different layers on a number of different substrates - uses in the electronics as an insulator? Lastly, there is also strong evidence that aragonite nacre is osteoinductive and could be exploited in the stimulation of bone production in, for example, osteoporosis if synthetic nacre could be provided in a suitable form. So, one basic compound - calcium carbonate - so many different ways we could use it.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The most significant exploitation is the construction of the mantle transcriptome and initial proteome analysis of M. edulis. Comparison sequence searches show that the mantle transcripts for M. edulis encode putative proteins exhibiting sequence similarities with previously characterised shell proteins of other species of Mytilus, the Bivalvia Pinctada and haliotid gastropods. Importantly, this enhanced transcriptome has detected several transcripts that encode proteins with sequence similarity with previously described shell biomineral proteins including ?Shematrins and lysine rich matrix proteins (KRMPs), not previously found in Mytilus. This work is published in Marine Biotechnology and freely available to all researchers.
We developed novel microfluidics (lab on a chip) techniques to assess the influence of individual proteins on carbonate crystallization and polymorph designation.
 We also characterised the functionality of several proteins from the extrapallial (EP) fluid from the mussel Mytilus edulis. These proteins comprise: the main wild type 28 kDa EP protein, expressed 28 kDa EP protein, expressed C1q domain, the complex of three associated proteins, a 56 kDa anionic protein.
Characterisation and functionality of the main 80 kDa aragonitic protein from the extrapallial fluid from the deep sea horse mussel Modiolus modiolus.
We also play an active role in GLORI (Glasgow Orthopaedic Research Initiative), which is a collaboration between research scientists and orthopaedic surgeons. The osteoinductive properties of nacre and, (as we have recently found out in our mesenchymal cell work) the osteoinhibitory role of calcite means that we can offer new ideas in the treatment of certain bone diseases. The primary objective of these collaborations is that the surgeons, who will use the &amp;quot;end product&amp;quot;, will have a say in its development and requirements from the outset.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>404D9CA0-5417-48A5-9A77-5C8C3E6EBA19</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Using microfluidics to investigate the effect of biomineral proteins on carbonate polymorph destination.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0D67CA4C-80A6-4D0F-95E2-A8B0D5EBFA44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was initial resarch which has now lead to future research funding in this area.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Microfluidics</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C41F51E1-7D79-4BE9-A1ED-86F39F2F67DF"><gtr:id>C41F51E1-7D79-4BE9-A1ED-86F39F2F67DF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Alignment of Crystallographicc-Axis throughout the Four Distinct Microstructural Layers of the OysterCrassostrea gigas</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Crystal Growth &amp; Design</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/df997998ca6dbfcca719f61cdf81c614"><gtr:id>df997998ca6dbfcca719f61cdf81c614</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>MacDonald J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A9C8DAB1-A10D-4F01-9679-F4A0A0D07249"><gtr:id>A9C8DAB1-A10D-4F01-9679-F4A0A0D07249</gtr:id><gtr:title>Attachment of oysters to natural substrata by biologically induced marine carbonate cement</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Marine Biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/df997998ca6dbfcca719f61cdf81c614"><gtr:id>df997998ca6dbfcca719f61cdf81c614</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>MacDonald J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F7F8EA99-7090-45BA-A401-5BD63BCAC8C9"><gtr:id>F7F8EA99-7090-45BA-A401-5BD63BCAC8C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oxygen isotope composition in
