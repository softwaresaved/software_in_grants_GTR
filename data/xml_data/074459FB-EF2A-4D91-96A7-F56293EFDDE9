At university, students' attitudes and values, including religious ones, are developed and challenged. In a post 9/11 world, religion is an increasingly important issue on university campuses, where students' faith may be diluted, liberalised, intensified or radicalised. There have been conflicts among students about religious freedom and equal opportunities, for example. Religion may have become increasingly privatized in the UK, but it has not disappeared from undergraduate experience, and for some it remains central to their construction of personal identity. Christians are the largest student faith group, notwithstanding the growing presence of Islam, and Christian groups (including Christian Unions, university chaplaincies and Catholic and Student Christian Movement groups) have long been present on university campuses. Nonetheless, there is almost no empirical research on Christianity amongst university students in the UK. This project seeks to fill this gap, exploring the beliefs, values and social contribution of Christian undergraduate students at English universities, focusing on how faith identities are negotiated and constructed within university contexts. It is a collaborative project between researchers in departments of sociology, religious studies and theology at the Universities of Durham, Derby and Wales (Lampeter). Reflecting the programme theme Education and Socialisation, the study will address how the religious identities of university students (age 18-25) are expressed and developed within the university setting: how they are shaped by the university experience and how they contribute to and resist it. Exploring the theme Identity, Community, Welfare and Prosperity, we will examine the contribution to students' religious identities of factors preceding university, such as family and socio-economic status, and by experiences particular to it, such as the composition of the student body (including religious diversity), prominence of student-led Christian organisations, choice of degree subject and institutional ethos. The research will be carried out by means of a survey and follow-up interviews. The web-based survey will be completed by students who identify themselves as Christians in universities throughout England, and will be the first national survey of religious values amongst students in England. The interviews will be conducted in three contrasting case study universities: the University of Durham, with its traditional with long-standing Christian ethos; the University of Leeds, a 'red brick' institution with a broadly secular outlook; and the University of Derby, a 'new', post-1992 university with a multi-cultural student body and an overt emphasis upon religious pluralism. Within each institution, we will interview a range of students in order to compare beliefs and values among Roman Catholics, mainstream Protestants and evangelical Christians. This project will engage the interests of universities, student unions, chaplaincies and faith-based organizations, all concerned with the interface between religious pluralism and social cohesion. It will advance knowledge and foster dialogue about the significance of Christianity within Higher Education, and of Higher Education to religious formation among young adults. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>334887</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Christian Ministry in University Contexts (Kingston event)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB7D3506-CF0E-4D3E-8BF1-4B6EF3FD2C66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Speaker and Organiser: 'Christian Ministry in University Contexts' (participants included HE chaplains, representatives of main churches, representatives of Christian student organisations), University of Kingston, London, 2nd December 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EHRC 'Religion in Higher Education' Consultation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2D281042-A4E1-44B1-8579-F00CFA52AB22</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to participate in consultation on 'Religion in Higher Education' convened by the Equality and Human Rights Commission alongside academic experts, lawyers and representatives of religious groups.

1. A large portion (probably between 40 and 50%) of undergraduate students studying at English universities self-identify as Christian (with around 30-35% claiming 'no religion').

2. This population is diverse, and expresses its Christian identity in a variety of ways, including around half of this number not attending church during term time and only a small minority apparently affirming the zealous evangelicalism commonly associated with Christian Unions.

3. Many of these Christian students appear to retain strong links with the faith communities in which they were involved prior to university, and Christianity appears important as a resource drawn upon as young people negotiate the challenges of university life.

4. At a conscious level, the majority of students view university as having had a benign influence on their religious identity (neither strengthening it, nor weakening it), although data on student attitudes does suggest a more liberal take on moral issues than might be expected among Christians, suggesting a migration to a position characterised by a liberal tolerance close to the social norm in contemporary Britain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project explores religious and ethical values among students, and hence could be instrumental in enhancing provision of welfare and support services to students (including international students) across the UK. As such, the findings will be (in some cases already have been) of interest to stake holder groups such as university chaplains, university student support officers, local church leaders, university counselling services, student religous organisations and the National Union of Students.



Generating national data on differing religious and moral perspectives among students, the project will also engage the professional interests of those concerned with social cohesion and conflict among British citizens of different cultural or religious backgrounds, i.e. university student diversity officers, local government, university managers and local religious leaders.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>015F5CD8-F17F-4A6B-9697-08D41981034D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cueproject.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6B502E9A-28BF-4A78-9108-8B7625260AD8"><gtr:id>6B502E9A-28BF-4A78-9108-8B7625260AD8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Issues in Religion and Education</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/33330aa0707f3df0d7df0c3a872ed0d6"><gtr:id>33330aa0707f3df0d7df0c3a872ed0d6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guest M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9789004289802</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C72AE68D-7684-4CE1-9D7E-DB132E875102"><gtr:id>C72AE68D-7684-4CE1-9D7E-DB132E875102</gtr:id><gtr:title>Death, Life and Laughter: Essays on Religion in Honour of Douglas Davies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c6a5d5bb3115077ba248b91e85680932"><gtr:id>c6a5d5bb3115077ba248b91e85680932</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guest, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn> 9781409457022</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/50D3CDEB-8C60-461E-AF97-773BCB42FC8D"><gtr:id>50D3CDEB-8C60-461E-AF97-773BCB42FC8D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Religion and Higher Education in Europe and North America</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/93b044e987f899481b37347b7b0a84c1"><gtr:id>93b044e987f899481b37347b7b0a84c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Aune, K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781138652958</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/980FB028-E804-4847-B0E7-78B63AA664F8"><gtr:id>980FB028-E804-4847-B0E7-78B63AA664F8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Challenging 'Belief' and the Evangelical Bias: Student Christianity in English Universities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Contemporary Religion</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/33330aa0707f3df0d7df0c3a872ed0d6"><gtr:id>33330aa0707f3df0d7df0c3a872ed0d6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guest M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9A5DBFD5-90A9-4154-9B4E-ADB0EA4ED82A"><gtr:id>9A5DBFD5-90A9-4154-9B4E-ADB0EA4ED82A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Re-imagining a Christian university in a secular age</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Beliefs &amp;
