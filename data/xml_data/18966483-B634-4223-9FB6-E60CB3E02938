Aside from the common nonlethal infections, several hundred people die in the UK every year of bloodstream and organ infections caused by this yeast. It threatens patients whose immune defenses are already weakened from cancer chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, surgery or by extremely low birth weight. Once Candida has spread through the bloodstream, it is extremely difficult to treat because it quickly develops resistance to currently available drugs. The emergence of drug resistances is facilitated by the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which stabilizes other proteins, thus contributing to their activation.

Hsp90 collaborates with Cdc37. Together they target signal transmitting proteins, so called kinases. The Hsp90/Cdc37 complex and its target kinases play an important role in the normal physiology of all cells. Sometimes though, Hsp90 goes astray. For example when it stabilizes cancer proteins in humans and promotes drug resistance in yeast. Both examples suggest that reducing Hsp90 may help fight cancer and yeast infections. Indeed, drugs reducing Hsp90 function are currently tested as anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately though, human and yeast Hsp90 are very similar. This means, it is very difficult to reduce only yeast Hsp90 but not human Hsp90 to cure a life-threatening yeast infection. Animal models showed that reducing yeast Hsp90 in combination with drugs treating the yeast infection itself caused severe side effects.

We will address this problem by investigating the role of Hsp90/Cdc37 and their associated kinases in yeast to understand how they contribute to the yeast's ability to cause life-threatening infections. Specifically, we aim to further advance our understanding of those kinases that are unique to yeast and that depend on Hsp90 as future drug targets. Targeting yeast specific components with a drug should prevent or at least drastically reduce side effects in patients.

We previously showed that reducing Hsp90 in yeast cells that also lack one kinase causes yeast cell death. This could be a promising approach for the development of new drugs and treatment strategies. Especially since Hsp90 reducing drugs are already in clinical trial as anti-cancer drugs. We furthermore demonstrated that some kinases regulate Hsp90 and Cdc37, while many others depend on the Hsp90/Cdc37 for stability and activation. Yet, knowledge of the Hsp90/Cdc37 kinase signaling module is sparse in C. albicans.

This project will examine the kinases that regulate the Hsp90/Cdc37 complex and the kinases that depend on Hsp90/Cdc37 by conducting three sets of experiments. First, we will determine how specific kinases regulate Hsp90 and Cdc37 and which parts of Hsp90/Cdc37 are indeed necessary for yeasts to cause disease. Second, we will focus on yeast specific kinases and study their role in yeast infections to understand, which is the most important kinase that would make the best drug target. Third, we will search the yeast genome for more kinases that depend on Hsp90 to widen the field of potential drug targets.

Scientists and patients will benefit from our research. In the short-term, biologists will be able to translate our knowledge of the Hsp90/Cdc37 kinase circuitry to the disease-causing mechanisms they study in other fungi or microbes. Structural biologists could crystallize promising kinases to elucidate their structure, which is a prerequisite for drug development by pharmacologists. Since Hsp90 plays an important role in a number of biological processes, our results could be used by scientists investigating genetics, cancer biology, and microbiology. The long-term beneficiaries of our research will be patients in the UK and world-wide that suffer from yeast infections as our research could potentially lead to the development of new drugs to conquer life-threatening yeast infections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal aims to understand how the Hsp90/Cdc37 chaperone complex and associated kinases affect virulence in Candida albicans, the leading fungal pathogen of humans. Every year ~700 UK patients die of candidemia with a directly attributable cost of &amp;pound;16 million. Two problems are associated with the treatment of life-threatening candidemia: evolutionary conservation of antifungal drug targets and rapidly emerging drug resistances, potentiated by the essential chaperone Hsp90. Yet, as of now, depleting Hsp90 and treating candidemia with existing drugs causes severe host toxicity.

I showed that Hsp90 depletion in combination with specific kinase gene deletions abrogates C. albicans growth. C. albicans Hsp90 interacts with 34 kinases, five of which are fungal-specific and as of yet uncharacterized. This suggests a promising venue for the development of fungal-specific kinases as future drug targets for use in combinatorial therapy with Hsp90 inhibitors already in clinical trial as anti-cancer drugs. To achieve this, three objectives will be pursued in parallel.

First, casein kinase 2 mediated regulation of Hsp90 and its kinase-targeting co-chaperone Cdc37 will be characterized by identifying physical interactions, mapping phosphorylation sites using Agilent HPLC-chips and assessing the effects of chaperone phosphorylation in virulence assays, such as biofilm formation, oxidative stress, iron limitation, and killing of non-vertebrate hosts. Second, the virulence potential and regulation by Hsp90/Cdc37of fungal-specific and conserved kinases will be compared. Third, the C. albicans physical and genetic Hsp90 interaction network will be mapped employing a bar-coded mutant library covering 85% of the genome in combination with next-gen sequencing and TAP-pull down followed by mass spectrometry.

Novel aspects include CK2-mediated regulation of C. albicans Hsp90, characterization of fungal-specific kinases and genome-scale discovery of novel interactors.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Different aspects of this research into the Hsp90 kinase interactome will benefit diverse domains, such as the science community, human health and the UK economy.

Academia - This research program aims to understand the molecular mechanisms of fungal virulence. Consequently, the most immediate impact will be of academic nature. Since this research is inherently cross-disciplinary, including genomics, microbiology, and molecular biology, it will shape the UK academic knowledge base beyond fungal genetics. Furthermore, this research program will contribute to the UK's academic portfolio of systems biology through the proposed Hsp90 chaperone network mapping efforts.

Biomedical research community - Two aspects of this proposal will influence biomedical research. First, by characterizing Hsp90 regulation in C. albicans and by focusing on fungal-specific target kinases, this research is poised to deliver novel insights into fungal virulence mechanisms. Second, the Hsp90 network is of great importance in several crucial pathways, which are often difficult to study in humans. Comparative analyses reveal conserved and divergent facets of the Hsp90 chaperone network. Yet, the current C. albicans Hsp90 network has limited comparative power due to its restricted size when matched with physical and genetic data available in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This gap will be closed by providing large-scale genetic and physical interaction data potentially facilitating inferences for human biology.

Patients - Every year ~700 people die in the UK of systemic candidemia. For comparison, according to the Office for National Statistics, 364 people died of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in England and Wales in 2011. While MRSA garnered substantial publicity, fungi are the hidden killers with an estimated 400,000 incidents of candidemia world-wide (Brown et al., 2012). This research aims to lessen the burden on human health and improve quality of life by identifying suitable drug targets to be exploited for more effective therapeutic strategies combating fungal infections.

Public health - Excessive use of antibiotics leads to the emergence of resistant pathogens with serious consequences, such as prolonged hospital stays, higher costs in infection control, and increased mortality rates (Howard &amp;amp; Scott, 2005). This research into the regulation of fungal virulence mechanisms could inform the ongoing public debate about the dangers of excessive use of antibiotics, which may raise public awareness. Furthermore, the MRC recognized the scale of problems associated with excessive antibiotic use as stated in the MRC strategic plan 2009 - 2014.

UK economy - Every year the UK spends &amp;pound;16.2 million on the treatment of candidemia in ICU patients, while world-wide $10.7 billion are spent on antifungal drugs. Identifying novel drug targets, as proposed here, will positively affect this situation by delivering new starting points for rational drug design with the longer term ambition of reducing the economic burden of fungal infections.

Pharmaceutical industry - Each year, $1.2 billion are spent on fluconazole. This most commonly prescribed antifungal drug was discovered in the Pfizer research center in Sandwich, UK, emphasizing the UK pharmaceutical industry's leading role in antifungal drug research and development. More recently AstraZeneca, the UK's second largest company, acquired Novexel whose echinocandin NXL201 is currently in preclinical development. Antifungal drug targets are usually discovered through small-compound screens. This research aims to further develop C. albicans kinases as antifungal drug targets for combinatorial therapy of kinase and Hsp90 inhibitors. Drugs of both classes are either in clinical trial or already used for a number of human conditions but not yet for the treatment of infectious diseases.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>479470</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Animation artist Tamara Webster (http://creativepool.com/MaraWebster) created a short video based on my Bath Ignite talk.
