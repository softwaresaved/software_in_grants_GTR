Although pastoralists are socio-economically important segment of the population, they are subjected to harsh environment and extreme poverty with poor infrastructure and social services. As a result pastoralists have poor health status with high infant, child and maternal deaths. Cognizant of the challenges and socioeconomic importance, there have been continental and national efforts to improve the livelihoods of pastoral people. Ethiopia introduced a community-based Health Extension Program (HEP) in the pastoral areas to address the poor health status and achieve equitable health outcomes. The HEP model, which was originally designed and piloted in 2004 for adaption to the context of the agrarian sedentary population, was introduced into pastoral areas with minor adjustments on human resource taking into account the cultural context, language and scarcity of high-school graduates.
Although there has been a significant improvement in the performance of the health system in the country, the impact has been less successful in the pastoral areas demonstrating that the adaptation of the HEP model to pastoral areas was not based on adequate consideration to the local context. We propose to follow the following steps to develop an appropriate public health interventions for pastoral settings: 1) description of the local context including existing health systems; 2) selection of potential interventions; 3) testing interventions (feasibility, acceptability and efficacy); 4) formulation of appropriate public health intervention; 5) implementation at a scale; and 6) monitoring effectiveness and adequacy. 
The purpose of this 'development grants' proposal is to address the first two steps, which will be used to develop a well-informed research project (moving forward through the steps) for submission to the 'full-scale research project grants'. We aim to describe the morbidity patterns, characterize the context and identify health determinants, and address the question as to what are the most appropriate interventions for pastoral areas. We will describe the wider context and barriers to service delivery to inform the design of strategies that ensure acceptability and service utilization addressing the question as to how to most effectively delivery health interventions building on existing structures. We will also explore existing venues that are potentially adaptable for service delivery in the pastoralist setting and address the question as to how to most effectively delivery health interventions using existing social events and services.
The study will be conducted in Borona zone, Oromia region. It will involve documentation and analysis of contextual factors and existing health services. The research will employ basic epidemiological study based on health facility records and registers, and community level surveys. Behavioral and social processes that put the pastoralist community at high risk will be described through qualitative study. Process evaluation will be conducted through case-study approach to thoroughly examine the underlying context at various levels of implementation and stakeholders using key informant interviews and Community Focus Group Discussions. The designing process of potential health interventions will involve community participation, adoption of innovative and adaptive approaches, and consider cultural sensitivity.
The study will contribute to achieving equitable health outcomes and the MDGs in Ethiopia and beyond, and to ensure the widest use of the research findings, we aim to establish a collaborative partnership involving policymakers and relevant stakeholders. Results of the research will be communicated through presentations in national and international conferences, publications, the Internet, and mass media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>To address the high child and maternal mortality rates, Ethiopia introduced a community-based Health Extension Program (HEP) in the pastoral areas. Despite this initiative the impact has been less successful demonstrating that the adaptation of the HEP model did not consider the pastoral context.

First, there will be knowledge relevant to policy and practice on the distribution of morbidity, health and health care behavior, implementation of HEP and beneficiary perception that will be available immediately. This knowledge will be used to change their decision-making and service delivery practices. Second the proposed research will develop and implement innovative service delivery model and provide knowledge on cost and delivery strategies. This will address policymakers' knowledge needs on the delivery and financing of health services and will enable them to use it make policy and practice changes in the delivery of innovative HEP to pastoralists and development of implementation and delivery guidelines for use by health workers. 

b) NGOs and Civil associations
There will be findings that are relevant to policy-related work of NGO Beneficiaries globally, nationally and regionally that are concerned with promotion of pastoralist development and health. They can easily embed this knowledge in their policy and health program activities. For example policy forums to which NGOs contribute and health service delivery activities in which the NGOs are involved. For instance, UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO can make the findings available to their health programs and influence service delivery policy through their policy forum.

c) Pastoralist Community and community organizations
The third main category of user for our research relates to groups such as traditional clans leaders, pastoralist community associations, traditional medical practitioners, the participant community beneficiaries. We will seek to contribute here to bringing community perspective and actively engaging them will form an essential part of our research soliciting their advice, contributions and feedback at all stages ensuring community empowerment and ownership.

Social Impact
Traditional clans who have strong influence and well acceptance and trust from their respective communities will get engaged and play the role of mediators on avoidance of risky health behaviors and promotion of access to health care services. .This study will document and mobilize the influence of the clan heads in solving local challenges for the government to consider the traditional approaches to get things done. Such input of the local communities will be critical to the implementation of the envisioned innovative health services strategy which focuses on improving acceptability of health services, health promotion and prevention measures by the pastoralist community resulting in improved access to and utilization of quality health services that would lead to reduction in morbidity, mortality and disability and promote health.

Economic Impact
There are several areas in which the economic impacts of this research project can be expected both in terms of overall economy and cost-effectiveness of the health system. This is because a healthy community reduces pressure on existing health system, also reduces inequalities and means that pastoralist community can be productive fully employed in the pastoral economy, which increases gross domestic product, generates higher incomes for citizens, and increases tax revenues for the government. Healthier people also possess greater physical and mental energy this indirectly enable pastoralist people to take their education further and equipping them to better manage their own health and use healthcare facilities more effectively. Another economic benefit would be the employment benefit from community members that would result from the implementation of the new adapted PHC model for pastoralists. There is also anticipation that the introduction of mobile phone technology for health service delivery that would have an added value to improving efficiency in service delivery and the improved market for the commercial sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>119638</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oromia Regiona Health Bureau</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ethiopia, Federal Democratic Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership for pastoral community engagement</gtr:description><gtr:id>E9EBB407-D895-4AF3-9616-237C0233351D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaborative research proposal entitled &amp;quot;Formative evaluation of networks of health development army to improve immunization coverage in pastoral communities of Ethiopia&amp;quot;; was developed by the collaborating organizations. The proposal was submitted to the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation and has been accepted for funding. Details of the funded project will be described at the respective section. 

The collaborating organizations as well as other key stakeholders have been involved in the implementation of the project and have been monitoring the progress together.

The project focusses on community engagement approach through the organization of women into development teams and one-to-five networks, aims to evaluate its impact on health improvement with the objective of developing appropriate community engagement approach for adoption into the health strategic plan.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Borena Zonal Health Department provided office facility to the research team at the field site. It also provided additional vehicle to support the field work during the survey period. The Borena Zonal Health Department also relieved some of its health workers from their primary responsibility of working at health centers, hospitals, and district and zonal offices to work temporarly with our research team during survey. This is in addition to the secondement of one staff described in the respective section. 

Both the Regional Health Bureau and Borena Health Department collaborated and participated in the development of a research proposal for community engagement. These two institutions are the implementing agencies of the intervention in the area and have been facilitating the overall implementation of the project. The Zonal Health Department has been supporting the research activities by availing the Health Extension Workers to participate in the project and providing additional transportation to very hard to reach areas.

The Borena Zone Pastoralist Development Office leads any development programs in the zone and they have been instrumental in linking our team with district and kebele administration leaders and traditional leaders who should bless any new program or activity in their respective village.

CARE Ethiopia and GOAL Ethiopia, Borena Offices, which have been working for long years in the pastoral areas, have participated in reviewing the project materials prior to the implementation of the project. Both organizations are among the key partners in the implementation of the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our research team contributed technical and intellectual input. After a number of meetings and discussions conducted with various stakeholders in the research site, our research team helped identify a potential approach for community engagement. The proposed community engagement approach involved organizing women into networks and building their capacities. With the hypothesize that such community engagement approach has great potential for higher impact in pastoral context where, unlike the providers of formal health services, the community members who lead the community engagement activities move along with their communities ensuring continued engagement. Our research team led the development of a research proposal to subject the approach to subjective evaluation. This collaborative project is being implemented in two pastoral kebeles (villages) in partnership with all stakeholders.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engaging study participants</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6643ED4B-80C9-4501-A6A3-F9303F820A56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 200 community members (including kebele leaders, traditional leaders, women and other members of the community) who were targeted for Community Focus Group Discussions attended events organized in different localities of the 4 districts.

It is a broad-based community mobilization platform, which involves grouping 20-30 households who reside in the same sub-locality into development teams, and then, each team is organized into one-to-five networks of six households living in the same neighborhood. The members of the networks are women. This intervention approach was conceived as a result of the MRC funded project. During the initiation stage of our project, our research team was involved in stakeholder engagement activities to create awareness of the objectives and methodology of the research project. During these multiple discussions with various key stakeholders in Borena zone, in addition to the inappropriateness of the existing Health Extension Program for pastoral context, another key challenge voiced by many was lack of community mobilization and participation affecting the pastoral health system. To address this challenge and strengthen community mobilization and ownership, we designed networks of women development army based on a similar approach designed for agrarian communities in Ethiopia. This community engagement approach is being subjected to formative evaluation through funding secured from the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie). The 3ie funding (PI: Hailay Desta Teklehaimanot) started in January 2016. At this stage, women have been organized into development teams and one-to-five networks. The leaders of the development teams and one-to-five networks have received training and equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to enable them influence their respective members on promotive and preventive health services. Draft intervention strategy has been developed, which will be followed by a series of evaluations and revisions to come up with the best community engagement approach for pastoral context. The health impact of the intervention approach will evaluated through the measurement of pre- and post-intervention immunization coverage. The pre-intervention household survey has already been undertaken prior the implementation of the intervention.</gtr:description><gtr:id>605C9A95-AB7C-41B8-81D8-CF0B997F0F27</gtr:id><gtr:impact>While the intervention is being subjected to formative evaluation and before the project is completed, the Zonal Health Department and Zonal Women Affairs have started to implement the intervention in all villages of the zone.</gtr:impact><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Community engagement</gtr:title><gtr:type>Health and Social Care Services</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2016</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M006050/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E4AF608A-CDB6-4CE6-AA10-95B3E043E22F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.1  Organisation and delivery of services</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
