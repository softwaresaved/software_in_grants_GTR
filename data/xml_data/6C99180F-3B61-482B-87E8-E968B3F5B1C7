uterine quiescence during pregnancy.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0901801</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Women in labour experience uterine contractions that occur with remarkable regularity and force. Myometrial (muscle of the womb) contractions generate periodic increases in intrauterine pressure, which is the clinical hallmark of adequate labour. With pressure increases, the cervix dilates and the baby is delivered. Abnormal (premature or too weak) contractions of the uterus can lead to serious and sometimes life threatening complications (e.g. preterm labour, dysfunctional labour, post partum uterine atony, etc). It is therefore important to unravel the mechanisms responsible for the initiation and timing of uterine contractions. The contraction of the uterus is triggered by an increase in the concentration of calcium ions in the cytoplasm of the cell, while relaxation occurs when cytoplasmic calcium level decreases. The rises in cytoplasmic calcium are triggered by an electrical excitation event at the cellular membrane called an action potential. This proposal investigates a protein (Kir 7.1) that affects the process of electrical excitation in uterine muscle cells. During gestation we propose Kir7.1 is important in reducing excitation and therefore stopping the uterus from contracting whilst the baby in developing. As the time for delivery approaches Kir7.1 would normally decrease and the excitability of the uterus increase to allow the contractions needed to deliver the baby. During this proposal we will characterise in detail the actions of the protein Kir7.1 and investigate whether premature loss of its function leads to babies being born prematurely. We will also investigate whether too much activity of Kir7.1 at the time of labour leads to poor contractions of the uterus during delivery. During the course of the study we will investigate a novel drug aimed at inhibiting Kir7.1 which may lead to new treatments for these devastating conditions. We should also increase our knowledge of the labour process itself.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Abnormal uterine activity has profound health consequences for both mother and infant and by extrapolation, to wider society, health care provision and national wealth. Clinical conditions associated with abnormal uterine activity are preterm labour (PTL), dysfunctional labour and post partum haemorrhage (PPH). Preterm birth is the major single cause of neonatal mortaility and morbidity. Dysfunctional labour leads to operative vaginal and abdominal delivery with its inherent maternal risks, and PPH is a major global cause of maternal morbidity and mortality with one mother a minute dying from the condition.PTL, PPH and dysfunctional labour have complex, multi-factorial aetiologies and it is unrealistic to assume that all cases will be treated by a single approach. One important component of uterine quiescence and contractility is the membrane potential of myometrial smooth muscle. In all mammalian species membrane potential becomes increasingly hyperpolarised from early to mid gestation and then becomes progressively depolarized as labour approaches. It is not currently known how this takes place. Based on data from our laboratory (a genome wide screen of K+ channels in laser captured myometrial smooth muscle) we have identified an inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir7.1) as a candidate for mediating the observed gestation dependent change in resting membrane potential. Using biophysically accurate computer simulations of single myometrial cells we have produced a predictive hypothesis of how the empirically determined gestation dependent change in Kir7.1 should modulate both resting membrane potential and the action potential waveform. The hypothesis for this proposal is that some cases of abnormal uterine activity are related to the pathological expression or function of Kir7.1. This proposal defines the physiological role of Kir7.1 in myometrial smooth muscle (MSM) using electrophysiology, molecular biology and computational simulation and ascertains whether clinical samples from women with abnormal uterine activity demonstrate aberrant function compared to controls. We utilise a novel compound (VU590) recently identified by collaborators in the USA for the inhibition of Kir7.1 and develop lentiviral miRNA constructs to inhibit mRNA expression in primary tissue in collaboration with the MRC Human Reproductive Sciences Unit (Edinburgh). The identification of Kir7.1 as a target in the myometrium is of itself novel and undocumented and is based on preliminary data from our laboratory. The project will capitalise on our findings to provide new basic biomedical knowledge and a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>520026</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Newcastle</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Health and Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Generation of a computational model of the human uterus</gtr:description><gtr:id>544DAB1D-7CA9-4E63-AD06-67B2098F4D0B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is an ongoing collaboration whereby a group of UK based researchers have been developing a computational model of the human and rodent uterus.
