They rarely, if ever, change to another type. For example, as skin cell do not naturally change to, or give rise to a brain cell. However, this stable commitment of a cell can be reverted by certain experimental procedures, as for example when the nucleus of a specialised cell is transplanted to an enucleated egg. During this reprogramming, the gene expression pattern of the differentiated cell can be changed to that of an embryonic cell. This process is of interest because identifying how reprogramming takes place can help us to understand how cells maintain their identity. This is important because many pathological conditions arise from loss of cell identity. Second, the embryonic stem cells that can be obtained by reprogramming a specialised cell of one kind, e.g. a skin cell, can then be made to produce healthy specialized cells of an other kind, e.g. brain cells. This has potential application in cell-replacement therapy, where these cells can compensate the loss of irreversibly damaged or defective cells. It might be possible to derive replacement heart, neuronal or pancreatic cells from another cell type of the same individual, thereby avoiding the need for immunosuppression treatments.
Despite its enormous potential, the usefulness of this approach is limited by its low efficiency, as only a small number of cells can be reprogrammed. The reason why adult body cells like skin do not respond to nuclear reprogramming is likely related to an inherent resistance of one kind of cell to change to another kind. Indeed, cells produced by transplanting the nucleus of a specialised cell to an egg often continue to show characteristics, such as expression of genes, of the specialised cell they were derived from. For example, a reprogrammed skin cell continues to express skin genes and fails to fully activate genes of the new cell type. This suggests that during specialisation, cells have acquired memory of their cellular identity, which prevents unwanted changes in cell type during normal development or during reprogramming.

The aim of our project is to elucidate the phenomenon of cellular memory. We use nuclear transplantation of specialised cell nuclei to Xenopus eggs as a model system to understand this process. In stark contrast to human eggs, Xenopus eggs are readily available in large quantities and easy to manipulate. Since the mechanisms underlying cellular memory are most likely conserved between vertebrates, and given the ethical concerns of using human material for this kind of research, Xenopus is the ideal model system to perform this study. 
The project consists of three stages. First we will investigate how many embryos produced by nuclear transfer show a strong memory of the cell type they were derived from. We will identify the genes that show cellular memory after nuclear transplantation. Second, we will investigate the molecules associated with cellular memory genes, since these molecules likely inhibit a change in cell fate during normal development and during nuclear reprogramming. Lastly, we propose to change the memory-conferring factors in specialised cells before transplanting their nuclei to eggs in order to increase the efficiency of new cell type generation. In this way, we will understand which modifications of nuclei can improve the generation of high quality embryonic cells that can be used for cell replacement. Furthermore, we will gain a better insight into the mechanisms important for cellular memory and the stability of cell differentiation during normal development and disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project investigates the epigenetic basis for memory of the differentiated state of a cell and how it acts as a barrier to efficient nuclear reprogramming. The aim is to improve the efficiency of nuclear reprogramming and hence new cell type generation by interfering with the epigenetic mechanisms stabilizing the differentiated state of a cell. 
We propose to investigate the epigenetic basis of cellular memory using nuclear transfer (NT) to amphibian eggs. First, we will address the extent of cellular memory in NT embryos using donor nuclei from different cell types and differentiation status. We will identify by RNAseq the genes showing donor cell type specific memory of gene expression and then ask if this memory increases with the differentiation status of the donor cell. 
Since cellular memory genes resist the reprograming process and remain expressed in the wrong cell type of NT-embryos, we propose that memory genes are associated with certain epigenetic modifications that cannot be efficiently removed by the egg and hence act as a barrier to efficient reprogramming. To identify these modifications, we will next investigate the genomic distribution of candidate epigenetic marks in the donor cells at different stages of embryonic development via ChIPseq and determine how they localise with regard to memory genes.
Lastly, after identifying the epigenetic features correlating with memory genes, we will ask which of those features impose a barrier to successful reprogramming. This will be done by transplanting nuclei with modified chromatin to enucleated eggs. We will look for the improved generation of new cell-types and tissues in the resulting embryos by analyzing their gene expression patterns. Furthermore, we will score the developmental outcome of NT embryos. 
We expect to identify chromosomal components that can be removed for efficient reprogramming and cell-type generation, and hence improve the prospect of successful cell replacement therapies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We explain who will benefit from the results of our work and how this benefit will arise.
We expect that the direct beneficiaries of our work will be academic and clinical scientists working in the field of regenerative medicine. In the longer term, the wider public will benefit from our work, as our scientific advances could improve medical treatments and hence enhance quality of life. 
As humans age, the function of their cells and tissues very commonly begins to deteriorate, and an ideal way of alleviating the discomfort and malfunction of ageing cells and tissues is to be able to provide replacement cells of the same genetic constitution as the recipient, thereby eliminating the need for immunosuppression if cells from other individuals are used. The provision of whole organs or complex tissues from accessible cells, such as skin, would be a formidable task, but the derivation of individual cell-types seems realistic. It is now possible to derive functional photoreceptors, neurons, cardiac cells, etc. from adult skin, and these can be transplanted to recipient hosts. There is still much to be discovered about the integration of such replacement cells into a recipient's tissue and their continued function after transfer to an individual, but it is likely that improvements in this area will be forthcoming. A current disadvantage of the suggested production of specialized cells of one kind from another unrelated cell-type is the low efficiency of the process by transcription factor overexpression and hence the need for extensive multiplication of the derived cells, during which time genetic and other changes in these cells may arise. Therefore, an improved efficiency of person-specific replacement cell derivation would be highly beneficial. We point out that the short-term outcome of our proposed project is to (1) improve the efficiency of deriving person-specific replacement cells from accessible adult tissues and (2) improve the quality of the reprogrammed cells by ensuring a complete switch in cell identity.
 To give a specific example, person-specific cell replacement should give a benefit in the quality of life. The provision of a small number (e.g. 104) of photoreceptors can give some restoration of vision in animal tests. If an elderly patient who might have badly deteriorated sight could be provided with some restoration of vision, this could greatly improve their life and reduce their dependency on friends and social services. This would not necessarily extend their life span, which would itself allow other age-related problems to appear. Therapeutic cell replacement of this kind could therefore give a much improved quality of life without increasing the cost of care. To shorten the time and extent of the in vitro culture of cells, as could be achieved as a result of nuclear transfer work, could therefore be very beneficial.
The time-scale of such benefits deriving from our work might be in the region of 10 years. It is unclear, at present, whether there would be commercial or economic benefits to be derived from our work. However, successful cell replacement might reduce the cost to the National Health Service of ageing patients. A large part of the National Health budget is spent on patients in the later years of their life. There could therefore be a considerable economic benefit for government spending. 

 Lastly, results from this project will be of great help for scientists in the broad area of research dealing with the stability of the differentiated state and its dysregulation (embryonic development, in vitro differentiation, reprogramming, ageing, and cancer). Furthermore, scientists working in the fields of epigenetics and developmental biology will benefit from the generated transcriptional profiles and epigenetic maps of various embryonic tissues in Xenopus. We will make all the collected data available to the scientific community</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>559056</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P000479/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
