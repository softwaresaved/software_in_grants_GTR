These include gas meters and lights in our homes, healthcare devices, water distribution systems and cars. Increasingly, such objects are digitally connected and some are transitioning from cellular network connections (M2M) to using the internet: e.g. smart meters and cars - ultimately self-driving cars may revolutionise transport. This trend is driven by numerous forces. The connection of objects and use of their data can cut costs (e.g. allowing remote control of processes) creates new business opportunities (e.g. tailored consumer offerings), and can lead to new services (e.g. keeping older people safe in their homes).
 
This vision of interconnected physical objects is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. The examples above not only illustrate the vast potential of such technology for economic and societal benefit, they also hint that such a vision comes with serious challenges and threats. For example, information from a smart meter can be used to infer when people are at home, and an autonomous car must make quick decisions of moral dimensions when faced with a child running across on a busy road. This means the Internet of Things needs to evolve in a trustworthy manner that individuals can understand and be comfortable with. It also suggests that the Internet of Things needs to be resilient against active attacks from organised crime, terror organisations or state-sponsored aggressors. 

Therefore, this project creates a Hub for research, development, and translation for the Internet of Things, focussing on privacy, ethics, trust, reliability, acceptability, and security/safety: PETRAS, (also suggesting rock-solid foundations) for the Internet of Things. The Hub will be designed and run as a 'social and technological platform'. It will bring together UK academic institutions that are recognised international research leaders in this area, with users and partners from various industrial sectors, government agencies, and NGOs such as charities, to get a thorough understanding of these issues in terms of the potentially conflicting interests of private individuals, companies, and political institutions; and to become a world-leading centre for research, development, and innovation in this problem space. 

Central to the Hub approach is the flexibility during the research programme to create projects that explore issues through impactful co-design with technical and social science experts and stakeholders, and to engage more widely with centres of excellence in the UK and overseas. Research themes will cut across all projects: Privacy and Trust; Safety and Security; Adoption and Acceptability; Standards, Governance, and Policy; and Harnessing Economic Value. Properly understanding the interaction of these themes is vital, and a great social, moral, and economic responsibility of the Hub in influencing tomorrow's Internet of Things. For example, a secure system that does not adequately respect privacy, or where there is the mere hint of such inadequacy, is unlikely to prove acceptable. Demonstrators, like wearable sensors in health care, will be used to explore and evaluate these research themes and their tension. New solutions are expected to come out of the majority of projects and demonstrators, many solutions will be generalisable to problems in other sectors, and all projects will produce valuable insights. A robust governance and management structure will ensure good management of the research portfolio, excellent user engagement and focussed coordination of impact from deliverables.

The Hub will further draw on the expertise, networks, and on-going projects of its members to create a cross-disciplinary language for sharing problems and solutions across research domains, industrial sectors, and government departments. This common language will enhance the outreach, development, and training activities of the Hub.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197312</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Block Exchange is a fast-paced workshop activity intended to open minds to alternative means of value exchange.

It's comprised of a hacked Delonghi coffee machine, enhanced with a Raspberry Pi which reads signals from the coffee machines sensors, controls its functions, and connects it to the Internet. BitBarista is also equipped with its own Bitcoin account. It serves coffee in exchange for a Bitcoin contribution towards its next coffee supply. The coffee beans used by the machine will have been selected collectively by previous customers. The interaction begins with the machine displaying data on the state of coffee-producing countries looking for information on climate, work conditions, political situation, infrastructure, price stability and demand, which the machine purportedly browses online. From this data the machine selects top-ranked options for coffee beans in 4 categories: best quality, lowest price, lowest environmental impact and highest social responsibility. It then offers users the opportunity to choose one of these options for its next supply, and customers pay for their coffee accordingly. After the purchase, a new screen situates the choice within the pool of choices previously made, all anonymised, displaying the supply most likely to be ordered next. 

The machine also presents some autonomous features: it can order coffee and reward customers for helping with its maintenance, e.g. by refilling coffee beans, filling its water tank, and cleaning out used coffee grounds. When Bitbarista detects that a maintenance task needs performing, it will request help from customers and offer either free coffee or a payment in Bitcoin in return. Bitbarista is fitted with a small camera, enabling it to read smart codes for Bitcoin transactions, so that it can make payments to customers' Bitcoin wallets.</gtr:description><gtr:id>927C9AA0-22B6-498C-B968-7E4BDE18817A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BitBarista has formed an integral part of a study on initial perceptions of data transactions with a new Internet of Things device.

A key emphasis of the day were conversations about future strategic research directions across RCUK (and potentially more widely) related to 'digital living'. A bunch of people from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, some technical types, quite a few social scientists, and research council representatives came along - for example John Baird and Andrew Prescott (as AHRC Digital Transformations Theme Fellow). 
 
The key motivator for the event was that the ESRC are currently reviewing the digital landscape through funding a scoping review on &amp;quot;Ways of Being in a Digital Age&amp;quot;, and are launching a new priority area related to this. The PI of their scoping review team (Prof Simeon Yates) attended the workshop, representing the ESRC's current direction and outlining initial findings, and Shaun (Lawson), who was part of the initial ESRC process of consultation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://balancenetwork.bimserver2.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BitBarista in the Edinburgh Digital Entertainment Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5795736C-AA71-4620-8E0E-A8B2F6C15D71</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work by Design Informatics is showcased at the Edinburgh Digital Entertainment Festival, 4-28 August 2016.

In this demo we introduce Bitbarista, a coffee machine that exemplifies a new approach to data access and usage for the design of IoT devices. Bitbarista is connected to the Internet and attempts to communicate complex data processes, gathering consistent information on the state of coffee producing countries. It reveals the social, environmental, qualitative and economic aspects of coffee supply chains affecting end-prices, of which consumers are often unaware. Bitbarista allows people to choose a source of future coffee beans for the machine, and situates their choices within the pool of decisions previously made. In doing so, it places customers within the complexity of factors involved in coffee production, distribution and purchase. The aim is to expose this complexity in order to re-engage users in the market forces that influence and are driven by their choices, providing a positive experience of data display, usage and sharing.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/recentnews/design-informatics-at-the-festival</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RISE Connect Event EPSRC.

Artist: Rory Gianni, Ella Tallyn, Mark Kobine, Larissa Pschetz (Design Informatics)
BitBarista is an example of an Internet of Things device, one of a growing number of devices connected to the internet that can collect, exchange and use data. BitBarista uses Bitcoin currency enabling customers to engage with this new form of transaction that can move beyond currency into new types of value exchange. 
 
BitBarista is a Delonghi home coffee machine that has been enhanced by the addition of a Raspberry Pi computer which interfaces with the coffee machine enabling the computer to control its functions. BitBarista has its own Bitcoin account, so it can accept and make Bitcoin payments. This means that customers can pay for coffee in Bitcoin, and BitBarista can also make Bitcoin payments to customers in return for maintenance tasks such as refilling the water or cleaning away coffee grinds. The idea is that BitBarista becomes semi-autonomous, trading with customers to take care of its own maintenance requirements.
The Edinburgh Digital Entertainment Festival (4-27 August 2016) is to launch this year as a new face on the Fringe circuit, the festival &amp;quot;presented by Riverside Studios, brings together the worlds of arts, entertainment and technology - to showcase the best of what is happening right now and provoke the conversation about what comes next.&amp;quot; The festival will take place on George Square and the Assembly Rooms this August and we are delighted that Design Informatics and the University of Edinburgh, ECA will be taking part.
 
We will be showing work by Design Informatics researchers and Masters students in a specially commissioned structure by Biomorphis architects. A range of products and experiences will be shown that invite you to live a little further into the future, looking at the theme of Living with Data. Come and get married for 15 minutes with our smart contracting app, have a cuppa from the bitcoin coffee machine and try out intelligent furniture.
 
The Design Informatics Pavilion has been designed by Pierre Forissier from Edinburgh based, Biomorphis architects and Mark Kobine. Interested in how digital technology could be used to design a modular structure, Pierre wrote an algorithm to generate different cellular divisions to form the surface of the structure. Using a CNC router (Computer Numerical Control) pairs of sheets are assembled to form modular cassettes; the double layered skin constantly changes the view of the interior or exterior as you move. Prefabricated off site, and assembled quickly on site, the final pavilion demonstrates how computer algorithms are helping designers develop parametric architecture which is strong, light weight but evocative to the eye.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.designinformatics.org/node/438</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bitbarista: early results of study exploring perceptions of transactions in the Internet of Things</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3513B1A3-29AB-4FD6-9D6E-6A57375539B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A short talk presenting early results from a study of initial perceptions of Bitbarista and transactions with an IoT device.

Things2Things was a one-year-long project of the 3TU Industrial Design programs in the Netherlands that ran from January to October 2016. The project brought together a community of almost 50 professional designers and design researchers to explore the role of design thinking in creativity and innovation within the field of the Internet of Things. We have captured the key insights generated during the workshops in a booklet that we are launching at the Dutch Design Week, DRIVE Festival for Design and Innovation. 

Anticipating a culture of small scale, distributed manufacturing, the workshop envisions a scenario in which people receive not software suggestions, but material artifacts that anticipate their daily needs. Over a period of 3 months, three families will play host to three networked 3D printers that 'print' artifacts meant to aid families in their daily practices. During the 3 months, participants in the final workshop will use readings from families' calendars in order to design objects for the families, which will then be sent over the Internet to the 3D printers. During the workshop, participants will discuss, evaluate and create new design concepts in light of the diaries families are asked to maintain about their experiences with these unusual material artifacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://things2things.nl/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Future Festivals 2050</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C5D2C444-708B-4835-A696-6FF2567C7AED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Smart Transactions in Public Spaces (STiPS) is part of the PETRAS Iot Hub, see https://www.petrashub.org.

In this workshop we are interested in exploring not only in the exchange of monetary currency, but also in the concept of trading data and personal information, where the line between data and currency blurs, and data becomes currency. As well as the explicit exchanges taking place between people, we are also interested in the trading and transfer of data taking place between devices and systems, of which people are generally unaware, but which forms part of this complex web of data transactions.
 
In the STiPS project so far we have begun to map out the practices and transactions currently taking place in a series of ethnographic studies, and have explored reactions to the BitBarista a hacked coffee machine that sells coffee for Bitcoin.

Design from/with/by Data
 
The complex constellations of personal and shared devices that are connected to everyday practices that involve the transmission of data constitute openings to new markets in which different kinds of value are exchanged. In many cases we are becoming attuned to understanding how value is constructed as we use software: social media users are becoming aware of the many pros and cons of exchanging social values in Facebook, while Trip Advisor users understand the implications of their liking, disliking and commenting upon the economic values of hotels. However, as websites and apps become replaced by objects that we use in everyday life, such as making tea, taking a shower or getting on the bus, it is less clear how the flow of data that is derived from our interactions, constructs value and is 'traded' between services. This disjuncture in the flow of value - with and without humans in the loop - presents both opportunities and threats to people and institutions. This talk will explore the implications of emerging ecosystems and an agenda for designing human data interactions, that goes beyond the organization and understanding of data, toward the development of platforms that balance the values of all stakeholders within complex digital economic systems to offer a level of commensurability with a service.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Block Exchange workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EBD9D79E-B547-46F5-BFE4-6A298414B859</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Block Exchange is a fast-paced workshop activity intended to open minds to alternative means of value exchange.

Design from/with/by Data

The complex constellations of personal and shared devices that are connected to everyday practices that involve the transmission of data constitute openings to new markets in which different kinds of value are exchanged. In many cases we are becoming attuned to understanding how value is constructed as we use software: social media users are becoming aware of the many pros and cons of exchanging social values in Facebook, while Trip Advisor users understand the implications of their liking, disliking and commenting upon the economic values of hotels. However, as websites and apps become replaced by objects that we use in everyday life, such as making tea, taking a shower or getting on the bus, it is less clear how the flow of data that is derived from our interactions, constructs value and is 'traded' between services. This disjuncture in the flow of value - with and without humans in the loop - presents both opportunities and threats to people and institutions. This paper will explore the implications of emerging ecosystems and an agenda for designing human data interactions, that goes beyond the organization and understanding of data, toward the development of platforms that balance the values of all stakeholders within complex digital economic systems to offer a level of commensurability with a service.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=york-hci;9eb9c625.1603</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Millennial 20/20 Summit invited speaker, Victoria House, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B81AC9F2-C204-4EBD-8A99-56FDDF105BF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to talk about work relating to Internet of Things, Connected High Street and Tales of Things.

The Millennial 20/20 Summits focus at a unique time in the industry, where large and small businesses are dealing with a more-complex and ever-evolving consumer that requires them to think of innovation, disruption and technology as key components of their future. The way the consumer wants to shop, interact with brands, consume content and make payments are evolving and Millennial 20/20 aims to address this like no other event series has done before through a curated experience of multiple conference stages, immersive and experiential showcases and organised networking experiences.

The Summits in London, New York and Singapore look into the future of nextgen commerce from the perspective of a digitally savvy consumer with a micro-focus on key pillars that include Retail, Marketing, Mobile, Payments, Video, Social, E-Commerce, CRM, Advertising and Big Data. The Multiple conference stages are run with industry specific tracks including Travel &amp;amp; Hospitality, Food &amp;amp; Beverage, Fitness &amp;amp; Sport and Fashion &amp;amp; Beauty.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://millennial20-20.com/london2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Demonstration of Block Exchange principles at Talbot Rice Gallery / Playtime event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4EFF8E0B-C26E-4A03-8ECC-B6394A7B45A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talbot Rice Gallery was a special one-day exhibition showcasing the results of an innovative hands-on workshop. Guided by artist Rob Kennedy and curator James Clegg, delegates were welcomed to drop-in and contribute verbally and physically to a playful discussion about how modes of exhibition and display shape and manifest cultural, social, political and physical engagements within life.

Playtime tests the fundamental process of exhibition making by looking at how the manipulation of simple objects and basic materials can allow complex ideas to be shared in imaginative and accessible ways. Starting with an empty space and pile of cardboard boxes, the workshop will have seen a diverse group of academics and students challenged to play out and debate a number of games, applying the logic of a particular world-view to the subsequent spatial creations you will find presented in the Gallery.

Led by specialist 'game leaders' the project will provide insights into ongoing research from across the University and further afield. From animal behaviour to invisibility, from translation to tool-making, from cyborgs to lateral thinking, Playtime will overcome disciplinary boundaries and foster curiosity, fantasy and imagination. The content of the exhibition will only become known through its making, this process will reflect and encourage new forms of creative learning and interaction.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/talbot-rice/exhibitions/future-exhibitions/rob-kennedy-acts-of-dis-play/playtime</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Whilst we are at an early stage of the research, the BitCoin Coffee machine is proving popular in public contexts and it is a powerful demonstrator of how Bitcoin, Bitcoin wallets and how the Blockchain works.

Many models for the internet of things are based upon domestic settings. We are interested in understanding how IoT will develop as moves into public spaces.

Our deliverables are to develop:
User centred prototypes that offer secure models for value transactions between a wide variety of stakeholders and IoT devices in public spaces.&amp;nbsp;
Ethnographic studies of social, cultural and economic value transactions in public spaces.
Maps of value constellations within public spaces.
Technical platforms to support secure value transactions in dynamic economic environments.
User centred design solutions that are accessible and easy to use.
User centred, iterative testing in public spaces.

We are only 12 months into the project and complete our first deliverables: 
A BitCoin Coffee machine which represents our first user centred prototype: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aac3Vx54F6E
And we have completed extensive user studies of different social / public sites.

Ethnographic studies using a variety of methods (interviews, workshops, technology probes) in public spaces such as parks and festivals, are providing insight into the value constellations across which transactions are established and normalised. In this context, the project is understanding issues of security, privacy, technical infrastructure and convenience. This phase has involved collaborations with the following partners: RBS, Royal Highland Show.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our study of privacy, security, consent, interoperability and flexibility toward adoption will provide important contributions to commercial, civic and academic knowledge on how better to design for public outdoor contexts.
