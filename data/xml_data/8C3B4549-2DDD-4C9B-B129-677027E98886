the UK</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/P005179/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project is an innovative interdisciplinary study of the experiences, skills and aspirations of young Syrian refugees, who have been forcibly displaced by the conflict in their home country, and the corresponding attitudes and belief structures of the host population in three receiving states: Lebanon, Greece and the United Kingdom. We will conduct surveys with these young refugees, exploring their aspirations and giving centre stage to their own perspectives on their needs. We will also survey members of the host populations, some of whom may be analogously disadvantaged, to identify their attitudes to refugee's training needs. We will then compare the responses of both groups to reveal contrasts and points of convergence in the underlying ethical frameworks that shape their understanding of the needs, rights and duties involved in this complex situation.

This research will advance our theoretical understanding, and promote important social and political ends, in a number of ways. First, our data on their aspirations will allow us to formulate policy recommendations to meet the training and skills needs of young refugees, with a view to facilitating either reintegration in Syria or integration in their host nations. Second, our comparative approach will give guidance on how such policy should be framed and advocated in a context of strained public resources and anti-immigration sentiment. By focussing on shared ethical commitments, we will offer ways to develop training and skills policy which builds consensus and cross-community understanding.

We will disseminate this research by producing five academic articles in journals across a number of relevant fields. We will also engage in an ambitious programme of knowledge exchange and public engagement, through concise publications aimed at policymakers and general audiences in all three countries, and through a series of six public events. We will make our data available for sharing through the UK Data Archive at the end of the project, following an embargo period that will allow for publication of key outputs. 

By drawing on our research expertise in the social sciences and the arts, we seek to influence both the content of training and skills policy, and also the public discourse surrounding such policy. By focussing on the ethical perspectives of both migrant and host populations, we will promote social cohesion and welfare for both groups: the former can have their training and skills needs met in a more supportive social context, and the latter can be reassured that the principles governing the distribution of scarce resources are ones which resonate with reasons they also share.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will have direct impact for agencies involved in policy and provision of training and skills. Through those agencies, it will have further impact for both migrants, and users of vocational education and training in the host population. 

Our research will identify training and skills needs for refugees, through an assessment of their own perspectives on what is required either to integrate into their host countries or to reintegrate on their eventual return to Syria. This will empower such individuals to shape training and skills policy, and allow us to produce a blueprint for policy which can be of use to providers.

Our research will also provide a tool for understanding how these policies can be articulated and defended. In the context of austerity, it is easy for appeals for funding to sound like special pleading on behalf of one group within society to the detriment of others. This has a damaging effect on social cohesion and individual welfare, especially when the groups concerned include migrants perceived by some as intruders in the body politic. By exploring commonalities in ethical frameworks - of refugees themselves, and of the host population - we will identify shared reasons which public authorities can appeal to in presenting policy. One consequence of this will be to make clear training and skills needs currently not being met for members of the host population who are disadvantaged in ways that are relevantly analogous to forced migrants. But, more generally, our research will produce guidelines for articulating policies in ways that emphasise shared needs and aspirations, rather than fomenting disagreement and competition. This will aid in the smooth and consensual delivery of training and skills provision, promote social cohesion, and improve the welfare of both migrant and host populations.

We have a robust and efficient plan for ensuring that our project has sustainable impact for these beneficiaries. Further details are given in the separate Pathways to Impact document. To summarise:

We are devoting half the project time of one of the Co-Is, Colburn, to coordinating and leading on impact. This will make ensure that we are proactively building diverse impact activity into the project right from the first day.

We will produce a green paper, aimed at policymakers and providers of skills and training, detailing in a digestible and non-academic format our policy recommendations. We will also produce a report on policy presentation, giving a robust and practical guide to producing consensus resourcing proposals, which draw upon shared ethical perspectives and avoid framing in terms of perceived conflicts of interests. These will be made freely available through the PI's existing research and knowledge exchange website www.austeritypolitics.net, published on institutional repositories and translated into Greek and Arabic for dissemination through our partners in Greece and Lebanon.

These outputs will also form the basis for a series of events, aiming to engage the public with our research and bring it to a wider audience. They will be run with existing collaborative partners because making use of current structures with a proven track record of successful public and policy engagement is the best way to maximise the likely beneficial impact of the project. To be specific, we have plans (detailed in Pathways to Impact) to run six events: an evening lecture in Glasgow in partnership with the Stevenson Trust for Citizenship; a concurrent photographic exhibition in partnership with the Greek organisation Solidarity Now; two evening workshops for providers and community stakeholders with the Glasgow Human Rights Network and the Glasgow Refugee Asylum and Migration Network; a workshop in Lebanon run through our key user Educart; and a Westminster launch for our policy proposals and impact publications to be run in conjunction with a local MP on the International Development Select Committee.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252263</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P005179/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>94426A22-17ED-4C9E-A77B-6195C1D214CE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat Education and Dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A05AA82B-96A8-4834-97FE-23963DE22DB5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Phases of education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
