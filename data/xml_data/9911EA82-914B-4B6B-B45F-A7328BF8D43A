BLUE-coast consortium addresses NERC highlight topic B, Coastal morphology: coastal sediment budgets and their role in coastal recovery. This project will adopt a holistic and multidisciplinary approach, combining the expertise of biologists, coastal engineers, geologists, geomorphologists and oceanographers with complementary experimental (field and laboratory) and numerical skills, to understand what processes control the coastal system dynamics and answer the relevant scientific questions. 
BLUE-coast will explicitly address uncertainties in the prediction of medium-term (years) and long -term (decadal and longer) regional sediment budgets and better understand morphological change and how the coast recovers after sequences of events, such as storms by: (i) improving representation of both transportable and source material within the coastal zone within models; (ii) establishing how transportable material is mediated by the ecological system using exemplar habitats representative of the UK coastal zone; (iii) assessing sensitivities of this mixed-sediment physical and biological system to possible changes in external forcing, including the combined impact of multiple variables and sequences of events, with the goal of understanding the internal dynamics of the system (e.g. nonlinearities, critical thresholds, tipping points, precursors and antecedent conditions) in parallel with assessments of behavioural uncertainties, and (iv) reduce uncertainties in medium to long -term prediction of regional sediment budgets and morphological change.
Project Overview: the scope of the Highlight Topic sets a requirement for quantitative knowledge on both physical and biological dynamic coastal processes in order to improve hydrodynamic model predictions of regional sediment budgets and morphological change. To deliver an integrated, holistic and cost effective response, our main activities will combine (i) a detailed study of representative shelf sea landscapes that spans the full variety of organism-sediment conditions typically observed in temperate coasts, with (ii) in situ validation studies of key processes, and (iii) manipulative laboratory and field experiments aimed at unambiguously identifying causal relationships and establishing generality, and (iv) integration of new understanding of controls and effects on coastal morphodynamics at regional scales and under environmental forcing. By undertaking a substantial element of in situ observation and process studies, we will directly quantify the effect of antecedent conditions on coastal erosion and recovery, the effect of biota on mediating sediment fluxes and pathways and the effect of event sequencing on coastal erosion and recovery, across a range of geographically significant sediment habitats. These data will act as calibration and validation datasets for existing and innovative numerical models that will be able to simulate the coastal morphological consequences of key biological and physical drivers, alone and in combination. We will gain mechanistic understanding and achieve generality by performing carefully controlled experiments, generating different flow regimes using flumes, tracking changes during natural events using state-of-the-art field measurement technology and, in the laboratory, using intact sediments and sediment communities exposed to anticipated future conditions (warming, ocean acidification, nutrient loading). As it is not feasible to quantify all the relevant morphodynamic processes at high spatial resolution across the entire UK coast, our approach is to address the principal objectives through 4 interdisciplinary workpackages that follow a logical progression of scientific themes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our research will deliver improved predictions of coastal erosion in different coastal habitats, along with modelling tools to better understand coastal recovery and to understand the implications of climate change for coastal systems. We will provide evidence-based advice for different options for coastal protection and management. We will engage with stakeholders at the national (e.g. Defra, Environment Agency), regional (e.g. District Councils, Internal Drainage Boards, Regional Flood and Coastal Committees) and local level (e.g. community groups, coastal flood fora, the public) using workshops, web-based material, newsletters and an end-of-project roadshow. We will also engage with non-government organisations associated with coastal land management (e.g. National Trust, Crown Estate) or with interests in protecting specific coastal marine species or habitats (e.g. Wildlife Trusts, RSPB). We will produce a series of short accessible videos having adopted the technique successfully before. Management of the project's impacts will be under the newly created Institute for Sustainable Coasts and Oceans at Liverpool. We will produce an annual project newsletter and the communications teams of all institutes will be proactive with regular press releases for both national and regional media opportunities, especially focusing on local media in the three 'coastal type' areas where our fieldwork activities will take place. We will develop a programme of engagement based around interactive activities at community events, visits and school project work and will target 'hard to reach' sectors of the community through exploring partnerships with organizations such as the Active Learning Partnership.
We will disseminate our final results at a mobile roadshow that spend a day at a key location within each Regional Flood and Coastal Committee. This &amp;quot;Moving Coastlines Show&amp;quot; will culminate close to London where we will invite national level stakeholders (e.g. Defra, Environment Agency, Natural England) and stage a question-time style debate. The KE officer (NOC) will work closely with the Knowledge Exchange expertise at each institute to monitor and ensure timely delivery of outreach and impact. Quantitative measures of success will include numbers of people participating in engagement events; participation in our &amp;quot;Moving Coastlines Show&amp;quot;; usage of our online materials; and by using YouTube Analytics for our public outreach material, as well as the number of media articles generated. Policy impact will be gauged by the influence that our work has on strategic environmental planning, but success in this area would be maximized by changes in coastal planning attributable to our project, particularly in the guidance for Shoreline Management Plans.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1321149</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>MegaPex</gtr:description><gtr:id>6F5084A0-6B0F-4F82-8069-27C037C2AC7A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New datasets on sediment transport and turbulence in the Rhine ROFI</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>They have supply superstructure to carry out sediment transport and turbulence measurements</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have been carrying joint research on the sediment pathways from The Sand Motor, working with TU-Delft, Deltares, NL and University of Washington USA</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Washington</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>MegaPex</gtr:description><gtr:id>C2CEA779-B9F6-4C67-BF5A-FA40D9628B4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New datasets on sediment transport and turbulence in the Rhine ROFI</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>They have supply superstructure to carry out sediment transport and turbulence measurements</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have been carrying joint research on the sediment pathways from The Sand Motor, working with TU-Delft, Deltares, NL and University of Washington USA</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>WP2 Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6564EDE9-2E02-4127-99C0-F9DE34C5D133</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Summarize the scientific elements of the BLUE Coast proposal, paying particular attention to the embedded scientific questions and objectives of WP2. Emphasize the three words or concepts that he recommended stay front and centre for the WP2 group: dynamical-behaviour, resilience, and recovery. These concepts will be tackled over human (decadal) to centennial time-scales and over length-scales that range from several to many tens of kilometres. The time-scale of the BLUE Coast project is 4 years, which limits the amount of time that we have to make new observations. Therefore, we will make as much use of existing data (particularly historical) in order to train and calibrate numerical models of coastal change. The limitations of incomplete data will dictate the types of questions that we can tackle. Partly for this reason, we have chosen to limit ourselves to the use of a few relatively well established models that were developed (or improved) largely in the iCoasst project. In particular, we will use the CoastalME modelling framework that emerged from iCoasst and that enables the coupling of well-known models, including SCAPE, ASMITA, and COVE. In this sense, BLUE Coast has a scientific lineage that can be traced to and beyond iCoasst, and the types of questions and methods that BLUE Coast plan to resolve are a natural extension from those posed in iCoasst. The paper with a full description of CoastalME proof of concept is now under public review (http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2016-264/).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>End users meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9E13CBDF-7088-4D21-A330-EC7E5BA04684</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Practical outputs would include the continued development of the EA guidance documentation.

Runs are for 2008/2009 (calm) and 2013/2014 (stormy) using a morphological factor to upscale a spring and neap tidal cycle to 100 year period without sea level rise. If required incremental increases in sea level could be added to the still water level applied within the model. This would capture local impacts of sea level rise but not the effects on the conditions forcing the outer boundary. A hindcast is performed to check morphological evolution before simulating projections. A coastal resolution of ~ 200 m in the south becoming finer in the north (~20 m) is used. A nested approach (domain decomposition) enables 2-way exchange of information between grids of different resolution. This provides higher resolution over the Suffolk coast, there are plans for continued nesting at Minsmere and Dungeness to drive the offshore boundary of XBeach(-G) as surfzone dynamics are not included in Delft3D.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7A09326A-5EA8-4B0B-85F8-96E0084CA811</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Model is just recently been setup, but it will accelerate research on the consortia</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>DELFT-3D implementation for UK coastal waters</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/15BD1C36-955A-4510-BB62-AE220BF270EC"><gtr:id>15BD1C36-955A-4510-BB62-AE220BF270EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effectiveness of beach mega-nourishment, assessed over three management epochs.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of environmental management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b5972aac6e4f4128eb96dcaf53080fb8"><gtr:id>b5972aac6e4f4128eb96dcaf53080fb8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown JM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0301-4797</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N015894/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5537B6B2-9FD6-40FB-B300-64555528D3FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sediment/Sedimentary Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
