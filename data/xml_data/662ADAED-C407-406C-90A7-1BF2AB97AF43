Neighbourhoods</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L001489/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The main aims of this seminar series are to advance knowledge on the roles of homes and neighbourhoods for firm formation and entrepreneurship and to inform/influence enterprise and housing policy and practice. This is important as the lack of research and empirical base in this field has led policymakers to neglect home-based businesses and existing barriers for entrepreneurial activities in homes and their local neighbourhood contexts. By gaining a better understanding of the significance of the embeddedness of entrepreneurship in homes and neighbourhoods, the view will be critically advanced that entrepreneurial activities are local assets that require more attention in enterprise, neighbourhood and housing research and policy and open up new perspectives for economic growth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The seminars are designed to identify key issues and research gaps and to develop a policy and practice agenda. Important aspects of this seminar series will be to engage with policymakers and practitioners and learn from international experiences. Two seminars will therefore be hosted by key government bodies (the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills and The Scottish Government), practitioners will take part in the seminars to discuss the relevance for their work and an international network of researchers will be set up.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Seminar Series addresses the intertwined issues of entrepreneurship, housing, and neighbourhoods. The beneficiaries span different policy and practice areas, professional groups and academic disciplines:

- Policymakers in enterprise policy at UK, devolved, city and local levels, in particular the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS), and equivalents in the devolved administrations and City Councils, will benefit through knowledge of the economic significance and wider benefits of home-based businesses in the UK and other countries and a better understanding of start-up processes and economic growth. Specifically, the Directorate for Business of the Scottish Government is interested in learning how to strengthen communities as part of their assets-based approach. BIS considers this Seminar Series as important for the work of its 'Local Growth' team. The Barnet Council and the London Assembly Economy Committee at the Greater London Authority have indicated interest to actively engage in the Seminar Series in relation to developing their future local economic growth strategies.
- Policymakers in housing and neighbourhood policy, in particular the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Homes and Communities Agency and equivalents in the devolved administrations, will benefit from this Seminar Series in understanding the links between housing and neighbourhood policy with enterprise policy, and the economic outcomes of housing.
- Business support services and sub-national economic development agencies (e.g. Business Gateway), will gain a better understanding of how people start-up businesses and the needs of home-based businesses. This is of relevance for national/regional funding schemes and advice services.
- The Seminar Series will be of relevance for lenders in better understanding the nature of home-based businesses, access to business finance, and barriers to economic growth.
- Home-based business networks such as Enterprise Nation will benefit through contacts to policymakers and the development of networks to researchers established by regular seminars and the JISC mailing list.
- Social housing providers and house builders will learn how entrepreneurship can be facilitated in social housing and through house design. In particular, social housing providers will benefit from networks to policymakers to discuss future regulations in social housing. This is of relevance given that the most recent round of welfare reforms will have a significant impact on the under-occupancy rule ('bedroom tax') from April 2013.
- This Seminar Series is of relevance for the entrepreneurship community across different academic disciplines. Entrepreneurship researchers in economics and economic geography will benefit from the exploration of theories in other social sciences including neighbourhood effects and neighbourhood change, housing, social capital, community development and assets, social economy, and empowerment. This cross-fertilisation of ideas and theories will enable a better understanding of the economic outcomes of individual behaviour.
- The interdisciplinary nature of the Seminar series will add to housing and neighbourhood research across disciplines by developing linkages between neighbourhood change and community development with agglomeration and cluster theory, economic behaviour, and economic growth. This will enable a better understanding of the economies of neighbourhoods and the role of housing in the economy.

There is the potential for exploitation of outcomes of this Seminar Series in the UK, England, Scotland, The Netherlands, Germany and elsewhere. In the short term, new strategies for economic growth in local authorities/communities could be developed based on empirical evidence and international practices discussed in the seminars. In the long term, new policy and institutional connections may be encouraged by the outcomes of this Seminar Series across the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30412</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of St Andrews</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Microbusiness Research Portal</gtr:description><gtr:id>90BF10C1-5AD4-4A00-8FE4-BB5CE232022C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is of relevance for all interested in business, enterprise and self-employment across the social sciences including management and geography.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>BIS provided bespoke data for the portal and on-going advice.

- 2 day seminar, Sep 2015, TU Delft
- 1 day seminar, Jan 2016, Scottish Government, Edinburgh
- 2 day seminar, Sep 2016, Southampton

We achieved out goal that some participants come to all/most of the seminars. We could built a group working on micro-enterprise and home-based businesses that work together on follow-on research projects, papers and seminar series. In total, we reached an estimated number of 180 researchers in the UK, Europe, US, South Africa.

We believe that we achieved this overall aim as all seminars were attended by a wide range of academics. Moreover, we sought to bring together academics with practitioners and representatives from government. As proposed, two seminars were hosted by governments, one by the UK Department of Business, Innovation and Skills and one by the Scottish Government. However, we generally reached out to non-academics through inviting, for example, practice commentators which proved to be very successful in generating discussions and new ideas. 

The seminars generally identified the great and increasing interest in government, business practice and academia in the recent rise of self-employment, its nature and contribution to the economy. Discussions about whether self-employment is a reflection of necessity versus opportunity were insightful and highlighted the various motivations of people to become self-employed and the need of a more nuanced assessment of those.

More specifically, the seminars focussed on a large and growing segment of the small business sector: self-employed workers, freelance, home-based businesses, small businesses that operate largely or exclusively online and small businesses in technology sectors. While existing small business research focussed on the ICT use of small business and how this can be increased, digital opportunities for entrepreneurship and new business practices and business models based on new Web 2.0 technologies, our seminar series expanded this new technology research agenda in small business research in three ways.

First, it brought the social dimension of digital entrepreneurship into emerging business models and practices. In doing so, it made strong connections between business and entrepreneurship research with social theory, including intersectionality.

Second, with the focus on the contradictions of new technologies and small businesses the seminar series provided a critical and nuanced discussion about the implications of new technologies and online platforms on small business and entrepreneurship. This clearly added to existing research that focusses on positive aspects. 

Third, a variety of small businesses and entrepreneurs including new under-researched businesses that evolved around new Web 2.0 technologies such as blogging were explored. This varied coverage provided new insights into the circumstances and context of how new technologies affect small business and entrepreneurship.

The seminar series revealed that there is the urgent need in academia, practice and policy to better understand current contradictions of emerging new technologies and entrepreneurship and small business, both in cities and rural areas. With the outcomes of this seminar series we hope to make a significant contribution to fill this knowledge gap as well as engaging with the wider debate on the changing nature of work, particularly the nature and the economic and social impact of one-person businesses.

From the seminar series we published two books with Edward Elgar that highlight key findings and ideas/suggestions for a new research agenda in the intersection of entrepreneurship and neighbourhoods.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We believe that the seminars triggered new research and research collaboration, some of which we are involved in. We feel it is a great achievement to have stimulated others to work on micro-enterprises and home-based businesses in the UK, Europe and the US.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D41F584F-05D6-4C21-B1EE-E87C2087B57B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Bringing Microbusinesses and Home-based Businesses out from the Shadows</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0A10BA70-BFB2-4286-8541-AB45695571BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Scottish Government has developed a home-based business guide (Enterprise and Cities Division) involving many departments/divisions, e.g. rural area, digital economy, entrepreneurship, planning and local authorities following on from our seminars and research inputs.

It further provides a database with information on available secondary data sources researchers can use for their research on micro-enterprises including home-based businesses. Here we provide bespoke information on what type of business activity is captured and what researchers can investigate with respective datasets. All datasets are for the UK only and the search is based on the UK Data Service.</gtr:description><gtr:id>491D5D4E-BACF-43EF-B144-A49E79C1AD38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Microbusiness Portal is used by researchers to search for existing literature and data on topics related to self-employment and micro-enterprises according to google statistics and personal feedback. Board members are active in providing new information and the first public seminar was organised in 2016 at the Middlesex University attracting researchers from the whole of the UK.

Over the period of 13th March 2016 to 13th March 2017, we counted a total of 1,432 users and 5,356 page views. Just below one fourth of the users were returning users (23.3%). Users came mostly from the USA (46%) and the UK (43%) with some further users from Europe, for example 26 from Germany.

The Microbusiness Research Portal has an active advisory board including industry and government as well as renewed researchers in business and management studies including the Scottish Government (Karen Halford), Emma Jones (Enterprise Nation), Professor Jonathan Levie (Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship, Strathclyde), Charlotte Chung (Federation of Small Businesses), Lorence Nye (IPSE, the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed), Prabhat Vaze (Belmana Consultancy).

We use blogs to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, for example from the Social Market Foundation on 'Self-employment: The missing piece of the puzzle' or Prof Jonathan Levie on 'reluctant entrepreneurs'.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Microbusiness Research Portal</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://microbusiness.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1246FE14-7404-4182-9D2F-D2471B014BAC"><gtr:id>1246FE14-7404-4182-9D2F-D2471B014BAC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Entrepreneurship in Cities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ae1613e4b6b1f603b7b0a2b46bf70ec6"><gtr:id>ae1613e4b6b1f603b7b0a2b46bf70ec6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Reuschke D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-78471-199-3</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DD75C6AD-BC95-475D-97A8-07086F4FB325"><gtr:id>DD75C6AD-BC95-475D-97A8-07086F4FB325</gtr:id><gtr:title>Entrepreneurship and Cities: neighbourhoods, households and homes.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4919d8536f6eaa680b2f876329550ce1"><gtr:id>4919d8536f6eaa680b2f876329550ce1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mason, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-78471-199-3</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/27C28317-1761-4B95-B9E1-03EF06A03A31"><gtr:id>27C28317-1761-4B95-B9E1-03EF06A03A31</gtr:id><gtr:title>Entrepreneurial Neighbourhoods -
