The importance of social ties and family relationships has been well linked to factors explaining desistance from offending as well as positive resettlement following imprisonment (Sampson and Laub, 1993, Farrall, 2004). As has been operationalized in these studies, practical, emotional and financial support are key attributes associated with more positive resettlement prospects on release from prison, including greater chances of finding work, training or education. Whilst the role of families and social ties can be important mechanisms in supporting offenders, few studies have focused on the experiences of family members in the imprisonment process, especially parents with children (aged 10-17) imprisoned. Besides the key role which parents can play in relation to desistance and resettlement, parents can suffer considerable impacts and social pressures as a result of a child's imprisonment which can ultimately impair parental roles in supporting resettlement and desistance. These include challenges in their capacities to seek support amongst friends, extended family, and via a range of community networks and social services (Patillo et al, 2004, Rose and Clear, 2001), in addition to impacts on finances and employment, stress, physical and mental health problems, and additional pressure on parenting duties (e.g. Ambert, 1999). 

This project will examine which networks prove barriers to parents, and which serve as facilitators and supporters in helping parents cope with the impact of having a child imprisoned. Here the research will conduct 60 in-depth interviews with parents of young men imprisoned, including those with community penalties or licenses attached to their sentence. This will gather data from parents about their experiences with a child imprisoned, as well as analysing the outcomes on parental social networks. Social network analysis contributes to the analysis how showing how markers of social capital, such as family ties, friendships, formal support agencies, are altered as a result of a child imprisoned. The project is based on two field locales - Parc YOI in Bridgend, South Wales, and London (working with Lambeth Youth Offending Team, and Prisoners' Families and Friends Service (PFFS). The organisations involved have established initiatives which support families cope with the effects of imprisonment, including parenting support, counselling, and group support sessions. The project will also investigate the experiences of practitioners from the Prison Service, Youth Justice Service and Third Sector in supporting parents, including the challenges in organisational and cultural environments, resources, and modes of engagement. 

The project focuses on assessing the ways in which imprisonment creates wider impacts on family life, such as on parenting duties, physical and mental health of parents, as well as wider sources of social and economic disadvantage. As well as providing a comprehensive picture of the needs and experiences of parents, the research will be used to support and provide recommendations to the Prison Service, Youth Justice Service and Third Sector for creating more effective family-support policies and strategies, especially those which impact on resettlement and desistance where a number of gaps in policy and service provision have been identified (Prison Inspectorate, 2011, Youth Justice Board, 2012).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The direct beneficiaries for the project consist of three main groups 1.) Practitioners from within the prison service and youth justice system, 2.) Policy makers in central government (including think tanks and charities with emphasis on issues of prisoner rights and resettlement), 3.)Families with a child punished by the Youth Justice System, 4.) The wider public.

The relevance of the research and potential impacts arising from the research can be summarised as follows:

1. For prison, youth justice, and third sector practitioners, the research will deliver outputs consisting of core research findings in a user-friendly document, along with working papers available on the project website. These will also be advertised through the social networking site twitter. At the end of the research, a workshop will take place with the practitioners and parents participating in the research. This is designed as an opportunity to discuss ways of translating the research findings into service policies and practices. At the short-medium term, the research will help inform organisational practice (e.g. how to use existing resources, partnership working, ways of engaging families in order to reduce re-offending risks). 

2. For policy makers, including those in government, charities, think tanks, and the third sector, the research is designed to evidence and reflect on policies and guidance. At a central government level this will principally concern policies through the Home Office and Ministry of Justice - the government departments in charge of youth justice and prisons. Research findings will be presented to the Home Office/Youth Justice Service towards the end of the research (medium-long term impact). The emphasis of the project in examining the ways parents use voluntary and statutory services will also be used in helping see where policies can be most effective in supporting families in dealing with the secondary effects of youth offending (medium term impact). Charities and think tanks will also be encouraged to use the research to help inform their research strategies and campaigns, which may also have an additional lobbying/pressure group role in some situations (medium-term impact). 
 
3. Families with a child punished by the Youth Justice System - as primary participants in the research process, the parents/carers of young offenders will be given opportunities to discuss the research findings and ways of informing suitable policies and practices through the Prison and Youth Justice Service. Whilst benefits will take longer to take place through policy change which impacts directly on such groups, the research will help carry through their experiences to wider audiences, including youth justice practitioners, policy makers, and the wider public. 
 
4. Wider public 
The research intends to help inform public understandings of youth imprisonment, and the wider impact this has on families. The research will be disseminated via television, radio and newsprint sources, as well as via twitter. Here the University of Surrey media office will work with the PI to devise a suitable strategy for disseminating core findings, including providing guidance on suitable media outlets. The public dissemination is likely to be delivered at a short-term time-frame, with the actual effects on public understandings longer-term.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>213900</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Her Majesty's Prison Inspectorate conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5500C31D-A46A-4AE0-9A81-8C07C1719DC6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 30 research staff/policy makers from Her Majesty's Prison Inspectorate (HMIP), alongside researchers from the University of Surrey, participated in a day conference to discuss key issues in prison research. Presentations were given across a number of research areas pertaining to the project, including consequences of visitation for family and prisoners outcomes, issues on mental health and wellbeing of prisoners and family members, as well as wider implications for resettlement following prison. The event is part of a developing working group between Surrey and HMIP to generate further collaboration in the area of prisons research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Used by HMP Aylesbury to start a pilot project with Family Contact Officers helping bridge communication between the prison and prisoners' family members outside. Gaps were highlighted in the research in terms of family members receiving little or no information from the prison in cases of prisoner illness or injury, or where major breakdowns to mental health occured. Due to a lack of information, family members reported difficulties connecting with the prisoner and best supporting them during difficult periods of their sentence.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1D1DD534-8BD8-493B-A475-A0421484673F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The fieldwork for the project has only just been completed. As such, only provisional analytic themes can be declared. As far these include: 

1. Our data show a significant improvement in the quality of relationships between caregivers and young prisoners during the sentence. Over half the sample of caregivers declared major conflicts with their children prior to the sentence, with the period of incarceration operating to stabilise and re-build ties. 
 
2. Major consequences for family discord and disadvantage were cited in the interviews as a result of parenting a delinquent child. Common were instances of marital breakdown, mental health deterioration, domestic violence, and in some cases, suicide attempts from parents. More focused analysis of this data is currently taking place, breaking the sample down into differences between gender of parents, ethnicity and class. 

3. The dynamics of family lives following youth crime and imprisonment also raise important questions about the causal direction of parenting risk factors. To date, it has been assumed that negative parenting increases the risks of youth antisocial behaviour and crime. Whilst we support this finding, we also indicate that serious youth crime can negatively impinge on parental resolve and coping, with parents (particularly mothers) citing major strains inflicted by their male adolescent children. We argue for a bi-directional assessment of parenting risks, which takes closer consideration of 'child effects' - how children's behaviour can impair parenting capacities - thus rendering the causal connection between parenting and crime more nuanced than previously suggested. 

4. Our sample of ethnic minority families indicates a number of common experiences with white domestic families, with the exception of more pronounced shaming in cases of Asian (Muslim) families, who have been identified as suffering different complications as a result of a child going to prison. Factors owing to religious norms and shaming are currently being unpacked for a research paper, with analysis ongoing. 

The project gathered a significant volume of high-quality data consisting of over 210 surveys and 62 in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of survey respondents. We also used carefully devised sampling techniques to collect substantial data from ethnic minority families - a group who have scarcely featured in previous research in the area of prisoner-family relationships. Papers for academic, policy and public audiences are in progress, with these likely to be completed by the end of 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am currently working with the prison service and central government to make recommendations to policy change in the area of prisoner-family relationships and resettlement.
