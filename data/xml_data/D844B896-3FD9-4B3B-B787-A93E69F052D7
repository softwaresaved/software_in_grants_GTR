By this he meant that a nation has a collective memory that is selective in what it remembers and what it forgets. To remember, every nation establishes monuments that invoke historical events and commemorate historical figures. Every nation also has a collection of archaeological artefacts and works of art that constitute its heritage and tangible evidence of its human achievements. These monuments and museums enable the citizens of a country to be united in what they remember/forget and focus their attention at a material site during commemorations. The French historian Nora has referred to these sites as lieux de m&amp;eacute;moire.\n\nBut this definition of museums and monuments reflects a particularly European way of remembering/forgetting. How then, should memory and heritage be conceptualised in nations outside 'the West'? Which technologies of memory are used in postcolonial nations? And, as products of colonialism, where do these nations situate their origins? This study analyzes the technologies of memory in postcolonial Senegal. It attempts to account for other technologies of memory and for other memories than the traditionally self-aggrandizing ones of Western nations.\n\nThe problem of remembrance is particularly astute in Africa. Nation-building has proved increasingly problematic. High levels of illiteracy do not enable citizens to imagine their nation as in literate societies (The political scientist Anderson considers literacy a precondition for the imagination of the nation). Moreover, while independent African nations initially traced their origin in pre-colonial empires, such discursive strategies have proved divisive as they privileged some ethnic groups over others. Today, African nations increasingly recognize their origins in colonialism. This study analyzes how this process works in one poscolonial nation.\n\nThis study therefore focuses on a range of lieux de m&amp;eacute;moire. It looks at the commemoration of the slave trade at Goree Island, either through statues or performances (illustrations 4, 5, 6, 7); the commemoration of a prayer conducted by a Muslim saint at the centre of the French colonial administration (illustrations 8 and 9). It also looks at the commemoration of the contribution that African soldiers made to the liberation of Europe in 1944 (illustrations 10 and 11). And it examines the commemoration of a shipwreck in the southernmost region of Casamance (illustrations 12 and 13).\n\nMy research focuses on material monuments and the commemorations performed at these monuments. One particular problem that this research addresses is how the materiality of the monument relates to what it makes people remember. The research demonstrates that monuments in Senegal are often contested, and one of the arguments pursued in this study is that the materiality of monuments makes people think and act. In other words, the form of the statue and its location often lead to reflexivity, and thereby shape a civic subjectivity.\n\nThis study also wants to take into account that colonialism, colonial anthropology and postcolonial theory have affected the ways in which the citizens of Senegal see themselves and their heritage. It therefore includes research on an ethnographic museum (illustrations 1 to 3), a tradition of divination and a tradition of conflict resolution, because all of these are partly the product of a shared Euro/African imaginary. Indeed, one of the aims of this study is to acknowledge the hybridity of the postcolonial heritage.\n\n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24612</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Points of Departure: Photography of African migrations was hosted by the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. The exhibition addressed the following question: How can a still image capture the movement of migration? How can a still image reflect the problems of (dis)connection, experienced by the migrants and the families they have left behind? Looking at the points of departure for historical and contemporary migrations from West Africa, photographers H?l?ne Amouzou, Mamadou Gomis and Judith Quax examine these questions in different ways. The exhibition was opened with a public event, and runs from 21 October to 1 February 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A8BCBDB5-945C-4FB0-B697-1CDDE812E889</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Migration is a major political concern of our time. More people than ever are on the move in search of a better future - but migrants who travel in pursuit of employment are sometimes seen by their hosts with ambiguity, accused of 'stealing' jobs. But whilst we are increasingly concerned with policing our borders, rarely do we examine the complexities involved in the migration of people from low-income countries to high-income countries. We know little about the lives these migrants have given up, the difficult decisions involved in deciding to migrate, the hardships experienced on the move, and the families they have left behind. Where have their journeys started? For whom do they make this sacrifice?

By addressing these questions, this exhibition has sought to give a nuanced answer to questions raised above. By showing the work of three different artists - H?l?ne Amouzou, Mamadou Gomis and Judith Quax - the exhibition has provided a dialogue on the historical relations between past forced migration and present voluntary migration. Handsome gallery guides have provided the visitors with relevant background information, as well some tours provided to the visitors by the curator Ferdinand de Jong.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Points of Departure: Photography of African Migrations</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://scva.ac.uk/art-and-artists/exhibitions/points-of-departure</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Points of Departure: Photography from Senegal by Mamadou Gomis and Judith Quax was an exhibition on international migration, hosted by the Pitt-Rivers Museum in Oxford.

In the year of sabbatical leave during which I was to complete my manuscript on memory and heritage in Senegal, I have been able to rethink the original problem and may now be able to fully reframe the research problem.



Postcolonial critics have seriously critized the European models of nations and nationalism. They argue that European scholars have always privileged a &amp;quot;historicist&amp;quot; model for the explanation of the emergence of (European) nations. And indeed, European historians of nationalism have always considered historical explanations for the making of nationalism. Postcolonial critics have argued that such a Euro-centric model cannot explain the making of postcolonial nations and that the assumption of a universal model of time which allows time to be organised in a chronological sense, is fundamentally Euro-centric.



While working on my manuscript and in dialogue with my research data on the memory and heritage of postcolonial Senegal, I have found this criticism to be extremely helpful. I have come to realize that much of the material heritage of Senegal and many of the commemorations staged in or around this heritage, is not organised according to a model of lineal, &amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot; time. The way in which the past is engaged is often meant to extend that past in the present, or on the contrary, to silence of subvert that past.



Hence, my research leave has enabled me to reframe my thinking about memory and heritage as so many ways in which the past is engaged in the present that cannot be accounted for in current models of nationalism. While Homi Bhabha's seminal work is crucial in this critique, it still leaves much to the imagination. My current work is therefore directed towards developing an alternative model of nationalism that is not based on Anderson's foundational assumption of shared time. How do heritage and memory organise time for the citizens of a postcolonial nation?</gtr:description><gtr:id>26D826CD-EAAE-44CF-A60F-CEA683B93FC5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/85445E19-F0C6-40F6-A3AF-3581A85B92FE"><gtr:id>85445E19-F0C6-40F6-A3AF-3581A85B92FE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Remembering the Nation: The Murid Maggal in Saint Louis, Senegal</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cahiers d'?tudes africaines</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e1918674fd6853415358892585a92131"><gtr:id>e1918674fd6853415358892585a92131</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>De Jong, Ferdinand</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D70F17E1-B813-4756-BB5B-2F7628018A72"><gtr:id>D70F17E1-B813-4756-BB5B-2F7628018A72</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ruines d'utopies&amp;nbsp;: l'&amp;Eacute;cole William Ponty et l'Universit&amp;eacute; du Futur africain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Politique africaine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c9731d6d96b7b6e3a0fc14dc0c872887"><gtr:id>c9731d6d96b7b6e3a0fc14dc0c872887</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>de Jong F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/443357AC-2C4E-4E70-ADEF-1800B6C946AF"><gtr:id>443357AC-2C4E-4E70-ADEF-1800B6C946AF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hybrid Heritage</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>African Arts</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c9731d6d96b7b6e3a0fc14dc0c872887"><gtr:id>c9731d6d96b7b6e3a0fc14dc0c872887</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>de Jong F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D240B92E-0B45-4FA6-86B6-2C8A574D7582"><gtr:id>D240B92E-0B45-4FA6-86B6-2C8A574D7582</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shining Lights: Self-fashioning in the Lantern Festival of Saint Louis, Senegal</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>African Arts</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c9731d6d96b7b6e3a0fc14dc0c872887"><gtr:id>c9731d6d96b7b6e3a0fc14dc0c872887</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>de Jong F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DF15B23F-E305-449F-A0E0-929CED94DEAD"><gtr:id>DF15B23F-E305-449F-A0E0-929CED94DEAD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Chronique bibliographique: Silences that Speak to the Slave Trade</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cahiers d'?tudes Africaines</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e1918674fd6853415358892585a92131"><gtr:id>e1918674fd6853415358892585a92131</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>De Jong, Ferdinand</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/90F8A17D-92CF-4E11-9875-2068A6BDB8D1"><gtr:id>90F8A17D-92CF-4E11-9875-2068A6BDB8D1</gtr:id><gtr:title>La trag&amp;eacute;die du roi Abdoulaye&amp;nbsp;?
