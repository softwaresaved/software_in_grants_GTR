and are high value chemical intermediates. However, current methods of manufacture are inefficient, wasteful, and often
unsuitable for complex structures. In particular, a lack of good methods to make secondary and heterocyclic chiral amines
was identified by the collaborating end users. The usual processes employ enantiomer resolution (50% max yield), which
adds processing steps and costs. In fact, the ASC pharmaceutical roundtable has listed this class of reactions as one of the
most important to solve, and continuous processing as the No 1 target in the key green engineeing reseacrh areas. The
chiral amine processes have all been studied and published by Blacker and Xiao using batch processing but not in flow.
Separation of the catalyst and its cost within the processes have prevented industry adoption. These issues will be
overcome in the current project using the Cp-star catalysts in flow.
The Leeds team is responsible for the testing, process development and scale-up/out of up to 5 different processes to
make homochiral secondary or tertiary heterocyclic amines (WP2). The studies require solid supported catalysts (Cp-Star)
and ligands generated at Liverpool (WP1) and YPT (WP3) and Leeds will test these in flow process equipment already in
the iPRD process lab, or slurry reactors developed and transferred to Leeds by AMT (WP4). The starting materials and
analytical methods will be supplied by the collaborating end-user companies (AZ, Pfizer, Syngenta and Dr Reddys)(WP5)
and the process data Leeds generates on product quality, cost, productivity will be used to compare with existing poor
methods for chiral amine manufacture. The processes to make homochiral amines are: (a) asymmetric reductive amination
(catalyst being developed at Liverpool, Leeds can undertake scale-up if required); (b) asymmetric transfer hydrogenation;
(c) amine DKR by immobilised enzyme resolution, continuous product separation and Cp-star catalysed racemisationrecycle
(d) crystallisation induced asymmetric transformation involving chiral amine crystallisation and catalysed
racemisation of the mother liquors (e) redox-neutral amine alkylation using hydrogen borrowing enantioselectively alkylate
amines. The chiral amines required by industry are heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines such as piperidine,
piperazine, pyrrolidies, indolines etc. Within the project the companies will supply real examples of each class of chiral
amine to illustrate the potential for this technology. The use of flow methodology facilitates screening of multiple
compounds.
The flow reactors that will be used are fixed and trickle bed, cascade CSTR and the novel slurry reactors that are being
designed by AMT and transferred to Leeds for evaluation in these systems. The reactors are all meso-scale which is
required to generate data suitable for scale-up to manufacture. The measurable outputs of the work are entantioselectivity,
conversion, yield, kinetics and reation rate, mass balance (ie green metrics eg process efficiency and waste), productivity,
manufacturing process cost prediction (raw material, operational and capital). This data will be compared with existing
processes to the same products to enable cost benefit analysis thereby achieve the main objective of this part of the
project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>167205</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>AstraZeneca</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with AstraZeneca on asymmetric hydrogantion</gtr:description><gtr:id>5F9EAD9A-EECC-4709-93BF-3C3B18C207A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The reseach is ongoing.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>AZ provided a case award to top-up the studentship.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The university provided a PhD studentship.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>25200</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AstraZeneca case PhD studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>AstraZeneca</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>89244</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6B5AE6CC-9E81-4EED-B84E-305E1B2C52D0</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Collaboration with YProTech (http://www.yprotech.com/) is ongoing to further develop the catalysts.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>25EA529A-BEEC-44B1-B362-80EB4322B07C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Chiral amines are common building blocks in bioactive molecules. However, they are frequently unavailable in large quantities, costly and have long lead times. Furthermore production methods, particularly for secondary and tertiary chiral amines are complex, inefficient and wasteful, often giving low yields and purities. This project has addressed cross-sectoral industry needs (pharma, agro and fine chemical), by assessing the commercial potential of some existing methods, evaluating application to real systems and developing viable efficient processes. The project involved collaboration of two universities (Liverpool and Leeds) and six companies (AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Dr Reddy's, Syngenta, AMT and YProtech). 
The first process evaluated was the R3 Method (resolution, racemisation and recycle) and this was carried out by Prof John Blacker's group at Leeds. 
The second process studied at Liverpool was reductive amination using iridium catalysts under hydrogenation or transfer hydrogenation conditions. The aim was to develop a promising family of chiral isoxazoline ligands found at Liverpool which had given a best enantiomeric excess of 82% and increase this to the levels of &amp;gt;95% ee required for a commercial process. The key work revolved around the understanding of the chiral catalyst and the synthesis and testing of the new ligands and complexes.
The project prepared a wide range of chiral ligand and catalyst candidates. This included investigating a new family of ligand types and immobilised versions of the catalysts. We also screened solvents, additives and substrate scope. The best chiral catalysts were also tested at two of the industry partners. Unfortunately no major improvement on the original system was obtained. However, a large body of data was generated for future ligand and catalyst development, as well as a promising start on an immobilised catalyst flow system based on a known chiral TsDPEN ligand.
The project accelerates the transfer of Liverpool knowledge in imine hydrogenation catalysts to industry and furthers our knowledge of industrial need in chiral amine technology. The project trained a PDRA in asymmetric catalysis and included the involvement of two PhD researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further research to improve the enantioselectivity by public and company funding is needed.
