allowing cell and tissue regeneration and degradation of damaged and regulatory
proteins during cell division, transcription, signal transduction and the immune
response. Over 3% of genes in eukaryotic genomes are involved in ubiquitinmediated
proteolysis. Misregulation of proteolytic control can lead to cancer,
metabolic syndromes, ageing and neurodegenerative disease.
We want to study one of cellular enzymes that mediate the ubiquitin-mediated
proteolysis, called the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and
understand how the APC/C ubiquitylates different proteins at different times during
cell division to ensure the timely and faithful division to produce two genetically
identical daughter cells. Deregulation of this process causes genetic instability, which
is a hallmark of cancer. Thus, unravelling the mechanistic action of the APC/C is one
of the major outstanding questions in cancer biology. Furthermore, the APC/C
modulates DNA replication, DNA repair, brain function and metabolic processes and
thus a better understanding of how the APC/C works in cells will benefit for human
health as new finding might provide potential biomarkers useful for early diagnosis
and information useful for the development of new drugs.
At present, major difficulties in studying APC/C-dependent ubiquitylation arise from
the sheer size and complexity of the ligase composed of 14 subunits and thus no
systematic mutational analysis of vertebrate APC/C has been reported. Now we have
developed a method to study Xenopus APC/C by reconstituted apo-APC/C together
with a series of unique biochemical assays. In this system, we can remove or mutate
essential APC/C subunits, which cannot be deleted from living cells. In this project,
we will focus on Apc3 and Cdc20 and aim to conduct an in-depth investigation of
their regulation. This programme provides a robust platform for new APC/C research,
by facilitating the detailed study of co-activator binding, activation and ubiquitylation
catalysis, while also assisting possible extension of translational and clinical
applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Protein turnover in general, and more specifically APC/C activity, are very medically
relevant in a broad range of disease states: cancer, birth defects, diabetes,
neurodegeneration and inflammatory disease. The APC/C plays an essential role in
dividing and non-dividing cells, however the molecular mechanism of how the
APC/C-ubiquitin system works is poorly understood. From the increasing evidence of
multi-functions of the APC/C, it is reasonable to expect that further novel roles await
discovery in a variety of different tissues.
To fully understand the biological function of the APC/C in health and disease as well
as to develop therapies, new drugs or interventions, it is imperative to study the
APC/C-ubiquitin system in its entirety, from the cellular to the molecular right down to
the atomic level. To date, the complexity of the ligase has made it impossible to
address the subtleties and detail of vertebrate APC/C function, however, we now
outline a novel approach that will finally reveal APC/C function and regulation. APC/C
re-constitution using the MultiBac system and a series of unique assays that we have
developed will enable us to manipulate APC/C function at will and decipher the
mechanism of regulation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1 Who will benefit from this research?
-Basic and translational researchers in the fields such as cell cycle, proteolysis, growth control, signal transduction, cell survival and cancer.
-UK and worldwide cancer research centres.
-Pharmaceutical industry developing anti-proliferative drugs.
The proposed research is basic in nature, and the immediate impacts from this work relate to scientific and knowledge advancement in the field. Our research also brings the dimension of biochemistry and model organism biology to the Institute and Faculty. Furthermore, it will potentially contribute for the development of new therapies of human diseases caused by dysregulation of the &amp;quot;cell division&amp;quot; such as cancer. Mitotic exit is an area of interest for anti-proliferative cancer therapy that is unexplored but a growing body of evidence shows that this pathway is promising as a target. The APC/C is arguably one of the most important regulators in this step and this programme serves to explore towards such possibilities. We plan to develop an advanced protein complex system, which will facilitate a novel approach to drug screening for cancer therapeutics. Once we have a detailed molecular and structural understanding of the APC/C, it will be 'more realistic' cancer target in pharmaceutical companies as well. Moreover, the activity of the APC/C is involved in G1 maintenance, dendrite formation in neurons, memory and metabolic processes as well as meiosis and healthy development of sperms and oocyte. Thus, in the longer term, this research has the potential to impact in several areas of human health and welfare, delivering wider public benefits. 

2 How will they benefit from this research?
Basic researchers in related areas will benefit from the mechanistic understanding of how the APC/C, a key ubiquitin ligase works at the right times and how it is controlled using specific subunits and co-activators. Members of the more diverse organisations or companies above will be also interested in our development of mutant apo-APC/Cs and functional analysis of vertebrate APC/C working and regulation as this will potentially provide a robust platform for new APC/C research, including translational and clinical applications, such as screening for small-molecule inhibitors. Moreover, Cdc20-APC/C interaction is essential for all living organisms including the parasites of tropical diseases (e.g. Plasmodium, Trypanosoma). The technique of reconstitution and dissection of the APC/C system in different organisms has the potential to unlock drug discovery potential, including tropical diseases. For example, the diversity of the primary amino acid sequences of Cdc20 and APC/C subunits (e.g. no C-box in Plasmodium Cdc20), will provide an opportunity to identify inhibitors specific for parasites and therefore safe for humans. 

3 Staff Development
The researchers involved in the project will gain expertise on-site with a wide range of biochemical, cell and molecular biological methods. Through our collaborations with other laboratories, they will gain additional skills, thus the project will provide skills and experience for onward employment and career development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>475227</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>430000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC Project Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/N008383/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B8CADB6D-A518-4F4F-8A2E-EEA2374A5BB3</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1500000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award</gtr:department><gtr:description>Investigator Awards in Science</gtr:description><gtr:end>2022-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Wellcome Trust Ltd</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>205150/Z/16/Z</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>37C487A8-9C0C-4155-A1AB-E951005480E9</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have established a method to reconstituted Xenopus apo-APC/C by co-expressing all of its subunits.
