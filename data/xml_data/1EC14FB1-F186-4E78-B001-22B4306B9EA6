The project aims to engage young people and the general public in the understanding of particle physics. Using visual arts and sculpture to capture the imagination; participants will investigate and learn about cloud chambers, Muons and cosmic rays. The artwork was originally created as part of a Social Sculpture MA in 2015. The artwork consists of a large black tent three metres cubed; inside the tent are cloud chambers made from everyday materials (a plastic pint pot, desk lamp etc).

Participants are invited to enter the tent where they discover the cloud chambers; in the cloud chambers they will see the ion trails of particles passing through the chamber. The experience will be followed by a talk and a discussion explaining the science behind the cloud chambers, the history of the Muon and about the art object. Participants will be asked to record what they saw using drawings.

The project will visit primary and secondary schools as well as being displayed for the general public at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Cloud chambers are a fun and interesting way to start to talk about particle physics. The project raises questions and awareness of particle physics, the nature of reality, scientific research as well as arts practice and drawing. The general public have limited access to this type of science and the tent creates a place for discovery and questions that can lead to a deeper knowledge and understanding. The project asks questions about science and art and where the two meet. The children will learn about particle physics particularly cosmic rays and Muons and be better able to relate to projects such as CERN and the idea of what a detector is. The presence of the particles will also open up discussions around special relativity. One of the aims of this pilot is to experiment with different ways of delivering the project to larger audiences, to develop the tent, the cloud chambers and record the responses of people in relation to what the have experienced.

Over the course of the project as more material is produced by the artist and participants, including drawings and recordings of discussions. This materials will be collated and displayed on dedicated project website, the website will be a resource that schools and the general public can look at and use. The website will contain information about the science and art used in the project.

Science is a fantastic way for people to experience the wonder and awe of the natural world. This project will show people a hidden aspect of nature that is happening all the time, and connects them to the wider universe. Another aim of the project is to instigate discussions with young people and teachers about the separation of the art and science in schools and education. It will be interesting to explore what young people think about the two subjects, what the difference are and if they see any links. In secondary school children it will be interesting to find out what they think of the work, do they see it as science, art or both? Do they see any value in this type of work?

The tent is a space for questions where art and science come together and allow participants to discuss and learn together. The tent is a new space, taking science out of the Lab and art out of the gallery, into the public realm and schools. Because the tent is portable and can be set up anywhere the possibilities for display are unlimited. 

Drawing Invisible Particles at the museum will be presented as a public artwork outside the museum entrance so people entering will pass it. Information about the project will be displayed and people will sign up to take part in the project. During the day groups of six people will spend 20 minutes in the tent with the artist where, view the cloud chambers, take part in a discussion and ask questions. The event will be documented and recorded.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Website and blog.

Drawing Invisible Particles is a pilot project. The majority of sessions will take place within schools and will not be available to the public. 
School set up: 
Day 1 14:00 - 17:00 tent is erected at the school. Tom introduces project at assembly (many local schools recently moved assembly to last lesson of the day). Tom inducts teachers and TA's running them through the process of investigating cosmic rays. This will resource them and inspire them to incorporate what they have seen in their lessons. The multiplier effect is that they will disseminate their learning across all year groups and outside of school and will investigate the project further through accessing the project blog and website which will link/signpost additional learning resources
Day 2 08:30 - 14:30 different groups of children and young people will take on the experience. Not only will the experience hopefully inspire them to investigate and discuss in class. Their drawings will be uploaded to the website to encourage them to visit, start and investigation and link to on social media. From 15:00-17:00 parents of students, possibly encouraged by the students will have the chance to access the black tent and get involved. This engagement with the general public especially in areas of deprivation can be a stepping stone not only to the science and links on the project website but also encourages them to visit the museum science days across the city.

The website and blog will be regularly updated by the Lead Artist and following each visit/event the images will be captured and uploaded. Not only will the website act as a link through to further science the website will grow into a resource for educators, artists, science communicators and public engagement officers. The blog will contain regular reflection and as the project progresses evaluation.
 
Disseminating this information:
Contact with schools. The project will have direct contact with schools. Multiplier effects occur through educators and students spreading the word.
Fusion Arts is a cultural partner for Oxford City Council sharing learning across cultural partners Arts organisations and museums on a regular basis.
The museum day will act as a public engagement tool for the project. Working alongside public engagement officers and outreach teams from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and Museum of the History of Science as well as Oxford Physics Department will give access to science communication networks. 

Museums and partner teams will be tasked with disseminating press for the Museum Science Day and using their social media to link to the website as a learning resource.
Science network and museums partnering organisations confirmed and projected- Diamond(P), Physics OU(C), OUMNH(C) &amp;amp; MHS (C), Science Oxford (P). Partners will link to and distribute learning from the project.

University of Oxford's twitter follower numbers exceeds 300K ignoring school classroom 1 click to 30 views - a 5% conversion (higher than normal + 1:1 conversion rates of participants) estimate of impact 16000.

A future plan that will see dissemination of the ideas and experiences from Drawing Invisible Particles, is to hold an Art and Science symposium in early 2018. We are in discussion with partners across the arts and sciences regarding holding a symposium in partnership with Oxford Museum Partnership to share experiences from different projects from varying fields and best practice. End of project hold a day to disseminate science public engagement through art. Possible contributors: Drawing Invisible Particles (C), 2000 days (C), Story Makers (C), Experimental Design (C), Nathan Cohen UAL (P), Paul Smith OUMNH (P). 
Following feedback and evaluation of Drawing Invisible Particles pilot we would look to develop the project into a wider reaching offer.
