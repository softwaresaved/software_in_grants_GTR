It focuses on Poland, the United Kingdom and Italy - countries representing different cultural, political and legal traditions - and their relations with other states and non-state cultural communities. Acknowledging the changing nature of the right to cultural heritage, the project will map how this right's evolving content affects the forms of protection, access to and governance of cultural heritage. The added value of the project consists in combining an analysis of the relevant laws, their implementation and enforcement.
Firstly, the project will provide a theoretical re-conceptualization of the right to cultural heritage, focusing not only on positive law and jurisprudence, but also on soft-law rules, diplomacy, and cultural cooperation, as possible alternative devices for fostering inter-cultural dialogue and understanding. Secondly, in its practical perspective, the project analyses how the technical tools used to manage and protect cultural heritage, in particular digitization processes with the development of databases, virtual museums, etc., are currently considered and how they could be further developed to strengthen the enforcement of the right to cultural heritage throughout the EU, including its external action.
Thus, the project will contribute to the development of sustainable strategies for protecting and managing cultural heritage as a means to foster inter-national and inter-cultural dialogue within the European region. Its outcomes will be twofold:
i) a ground-breaking contribution to an interdisciplinary scholarship in this area, disseminated through various publications (articles, reports, workshops and a monograph);
ii) the elaboration of recommendations and guidelines - openly accessible via a new online platform - concerning best practices on the use of cultural heritage for the benefit of states and communities which all have an intrinsic interest in its protection and enjoyment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By providing good practice examples and recommendations, the project will make a number of relevant suggestions to improve the enforcement of the right to cultural heritage within cultural rights in Europe, in particular through the use of new technologies. It will develop the current definition and understanding of what constitutes cultural heritage and how it is accessed and enforced within the current EU legal framework and will suggest how this can be improved.
In addition to academics, this project will have an impact on three other main categories of beneficiaries:

? Governmental bodies and agencies: those responsible for the development of cultural heritage policies will be able to refer to the research undertaken by the project and to use its definitions and understandings of the right to cultural heritage, including considering the application of some of the good practices identified through the project's recommendations. The relevant governmental agencies, such as cultural ministries, ministries of justice and foreign ministries will also benefit from the research in their efforts to strengthen access to and enforcement of the right to cultural heritage (as a human right) through cooperation mechanisms. The project will also have an impact on the action of states at the EU level, both for the internal and external actions of the EU.

? Cultural institutions and other private stakeholders: it is expected that cultural institutions will benefit from the project's outcomes, in particular its comparative analysis of various case studies around Europe. This will assist such institutions to ensure that they have the tools to strengthen their role in the enforcement of the right to cultural heritage through the project's innovative research on cultural cooperation. Other interested private stakeholders will include art professionals working with new technologies, such as those working on the digitization of cultural collections or the development of artabases.

? General public: the project has the potential to transfer its academic results to the wider public. The research teams, as well as the project stakeholders, are highly interested in organizing dissemination events connected to the topic of our research, such as art exhibitions, which may also be provided in a virtual form. These events / exhibitions will help to foster inter-cultural dialogue among communities which are in particular need of reconciliation with their difficult past in the process of building the national identity for which they strive. Intercultural dialogue can also assist in providing solutions aimed at the sharing of cultural heritage, instead of addressing such disputes and issues from the traditional perspective of an allocation of rights whereby one party wins all and the other loses all.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>107873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Jordan</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Jordan, Hashemite Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>HEURIGHT Team</gtr:description><gtr:id>241305F0-2763-470A-8035-B6753CCAB903</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is a multi-disciplinary collaboration which includes mainly legal researchers but also fine arts experts.

This special seminar discussed the enforcement of the right to cultural heritage from various legal angles. Access to cultural heritage was first be analysed from a human rights perspective, through a discussion of the practice of the European regional human rights institutions. More widely, the role of cultural heritage in foreign relations, including the role it may play in peace-building and reconciliation, and its place in international trade law was also be considered. Finally, the concept of cultural heritage itself was also be presented, including in particular its intangible aspect with a critical assessment of the impact of the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The way culture can be measured through the UNESCO indicators was also be discussed, as well as the potential impact of Brexit on cultural heritage in the UK.

It also sought to discuss this new EU instrument for the return of unlawfully exported cultural objects within the broader system of protection applicable to national treasures. It exploed the relation between the Directive 2014/60/EU and the EC Regulation 116/2009 vis-&amp;agrave;-vis other legal instruments regulating the circulation of cultural objects in Europe, including the 1970 UNESCO Convention and the 1995 Unidroit Convention.

So far, our research demonstrates that cultural heritage is generally present within the EU's partnership agreements with third countries. Its use in practice is however difficult to clearly assess. Although cultural heritage is diverse and may be used as a diplomatic tool in various manners, the accent has been placed on its safeguard, conservation and restoration, as illustrated by the latest strategy paper published by the EU in June 2016. Therefore, its role is understood in a limited manner within the external policy of the EU.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings will be presented to relevant EU representatives.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1F2FC85F-DDDD-4055-A0B3-7EA9A970B6D8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/53822FEB-BD86-44CD-B731-0BED76679991"><gtr:id>53822FEB-BD86-44CD-B731-0BED76679991</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Directive 2014/60/EU and the Movement of Cultural Objects in the European Union' (2016)</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Santander Art and Cultural Law Review 2(2)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8a28c86dc6c862ee60d09bedcefea794"><gtr:id>8a28c86dc6c862ee60d09bedcefea794</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fiorentini F.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N504427/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
