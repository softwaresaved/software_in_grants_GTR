Scrap tyre arisings in the UK are 400,000 tonnes per year amounting to 30 million tyres. In the EU, more than 2.5 million tonnes of tyres and 19.2 million tonnes of plastics are generated each year. Currently the vast majority of the tyre and plastics waste generated is landfilled representing a major waste of a resource. The recent EC Waste Landfill Directive (1999) sets a deadline for the banning of whole and shredded tyres from landfill sites by 2006. In addition, the European Union has recognised scrap tyres as a 'priority waste stream'. Plastics are also regarded as a priority waste stream and the EC Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (1994) and the EC Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive (2000) set ambitious recycling and recovery targets for waste plastics.Further, the EC Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC) applies to a wide range of plant including power stations, cement kilns and steel based furnaces and sets stringent emissions targets for NOx reduction, for example for existing plant built after 1987 plants are required to reduce NOx levels to below 500 mg/m3 by 2008 and below 200 mg/m3 after 2016 (for plants &amp;gt;500MWt).

This proposal seeks to investigate the use of two waste streams, tyres and plastics, as potential rebum fuels for the reduction of NOx from large combustion plant by way of a practical large scale experimental approach. The high volatility and reactivity of the tyres and plastics give a process advantage due to the shorter bum-out time required compared to coal which would ease the pressure of retrofitting rebum technology on existing full scale plant. 

Experiments were undertaken using a 200kWth pilot-scale reactor. In addition, since wastes combustion is associated with an adverse public perception of environmental concerns, a section of the work will involved a full emissions survey, including acid gases, particulate, heavy metals and dioxins. 

The results from the project have demonstrated experimentally, at pilot scale, that waste tyre rubber and plastic may be used for the reduction of NOx emissions from coal combustion. The process may be applied to power station boilers, however, the tyre or plastic waste streams would require separate preparation/milling facilities, possibly off-site. It appears that the Zn present in the tyre at levels of ~2wt% is volatile enough to remain in an aerosol form which in a power plant boiler would be little risk of deposits on boiler tubes in the radiative or convective heat transfer zones. The Zn will probably be collected with other fine particulate at the electrostatic precipitator.



Co-firing tyre with the South African coal through the burner gave NOx reductions of about 20% for a 20% tyre/coal co-firing ratio, but no significant NOx reductions when the same conditions were applied to co-firing with the South American coal. However, when HDPE was co-fired with South American coal, significant reductions in NOx were observed. Lower NOx emissions are achieved due to the different combustion behaviour of the fuels. That is, modifying the primary combustion zone environment makes it more difficult for the intermediate HCN and NH3 species to oxidise to NOx due to the reduced O2 concentration at the point of fuel-N release in the flame. The influence of the tyre-N content is thought to be small in the flames studied. On the other hand, the South American coal does not show the same response to the addition of tyre rubber. There is no significant difference between the NOx emissions of the coal only flame and that co-fired with tyre indicating similar combustion characteristics and flame dynamics. In all cases good burnout was achieved with less than 8% carbon in ash.
