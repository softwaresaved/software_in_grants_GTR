ER quality control also plays a crucial role in certain disease states (eg cystic fibrosis, emphysema, diabetes) where mutations in single proteins can lead to misfolding and prevention of secretion of the protein and hence loss of function. The X-linked disease retinoschisis is one such disease which results from a lack of secretion of functional protein, retinoschisin, causing splitting of the inner retinal layers, leading to visual deterioration in childhood. Over 133 mutations in the gene coding for retinoschisin (RS1) have been shown to be associated with X-linked retinoschisis, the majority being missense substitutions. It is likely that these lead to loss of function as the disease is also caused by nonsense, deletions, insertions and splice-site mutations. Many of these mutations lead to intracellular retention of the mutated proteins presumably through aberrant folding or assembly.

Retinoschisis is therefore an excellent example of a disease that is caused by the lack of secretion of a functional protein and provides us with an ideal model to fully understand the mechanisms underlying ER retention of a soluble non-glycosylated protein that is associated with a well characterised disease pathology. 

The proposed project aims to fully understand both the normal folding pathway of retinoschisin and how specific amino acid substitutions lead to a breakdown of folding and intra-cellular retention. The results will provide explanations for the molecular pathology of X-linked retinoschisis as well as addressing a fundamental aspect of basic biomedical research, namely the molecular mechanism of intra-cellular retention of non-glycosylated proteins.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>254824</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5EBACB46-91CF-4F24-8CCD-80CFBED8066B"><gtr:id>5EBACB46-91CF-4F24-8CCD-80CFBED8066B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Wild-type and missense mutants of retinoschisin co-assemble resulting in either intracellular retention or incorrect assembly of the functionally active octamer.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Biochemical journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9bc2b897faace1832b9361355d7e4e9a"><gtr:id>9bc2b897faace1832b9361355d7e4e9a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gleghorn LJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0264-6021</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0501600</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>A9061818-9B1E-495A-9617-7C77200827C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Eye</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
