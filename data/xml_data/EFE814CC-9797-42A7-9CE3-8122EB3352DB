Driving represents a common daily activity, where experiences and expressions of anger have implications for health and safety. As such, this activity can be associated with high levels of negative emotions that have a cumulative impact on long-term health.

Lifelogging is the continuous act of recording and documenting our lives, from the things we do, to the places we visit and even our feelings. Wearable cameras and body sensors allow us to capture rich information from multiple data sources about ourselves. As sensors become more prevalent, within our environment, the range of available data is increasing. This has enabled lifelogs to become richer with information and their use in various application domains, such as digital health, is increasing. 

The project will explore how multiple streams of physiological and contextual data can be processed and integrated in real-time to detect the user's state. Measures such as heart rate, pulse wave velocity (PWV), speed of the vehicle, location, and first-person photographs of the environment will be brought together to identify instances of anger and inflammation. A range of signal processing approaches will be applied to these data items (e.g. inter-beat interval from the heart rate will be subjected to Fast Fourier Transform) and artefacts will be identified and either removed or incorporated in real-time. 

Currently, it is straightforward to log overt aspects of behaviour, such as photographs, location and movement. However, this project will combine those markers with covert changes in cardiovascular physiology, which aren't perceived directly by the user. Hence, the project is extending a person's awareness of their bodies, how their behaviour and reactions to situations are directly impacting their bodies and the triggers for such behaviour, e.g. traffic congestion at a junction may raise our heart rate, without the user being consciously aware of this physiological change. Repeating this stressful behaviour daily, over a sustained period, could contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. 

Reviewing moments when arterial inflammation occurs and understanding the context of this behaviour leads to an enhanced perception of how daily events affect health. This can lead to positive changes to the person's lifestyle, such as avoiding the junction in question to help prevent triggers leading to the onset of cardiovascular disease.

The system will provide a new method to monitor and influence behaviour, which enables us to enhance and bring the field of lifelogging into alignment with advances in digital health. This is achieved using markers that are clinically relevant in the context of lifelogging technologies and developing techniques to process multi-modal signals in real-time. To the best of the author's knowledge, the integration of such biomedical markers that measures physiological changes in context to prevent the onset of disease has not been addressed in any other developments. Overall, the project attempts to reduce a significant real-world problem with an advanced mobile lifelogging platform. The platform will be evaluated in a real-world scenario to assess its capabilities outside of an artificial environment. This will enable us to gauge its robustness as a real and practical solution to log and quantify behaviour. In this way, the data collected will be used to identify moments of arterial inflammation and the context of those times to promote self-reflection and the implementation of behavioural changes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research addresses complex signal processing, data visualisation and mobile architecture design issues. Short term benefits within the next 3 - 10 years includes direct interest from:

1) Commercial Sensor Developers: The wearable technology market is predicted to grow from over $14 billion (2014) to over $70 billion by 2024. Developers building consumer mobile platforms, sensing devices and digital health platforms would benefit from the system as the prototype will provide knowledge to enable the production of such systems to become more advanced and commercialised. This will be achieved through intellectual property (IP) and licensing strategies, facilitated by LJMU's Knowledge Exchange and Commercialisation Team.

2) Charities, e.g. British Heart Foundation (BHF): The BHF is the UK's biggest independent funder of CVD research, currently investing over &amp;pound;88 million over 1,000 projects. The dataset provides valuable insights into the triggers of aggression, which could be used by the BHF and its collaborators. The research team expect to submit a larger collaborative application involving other external groups to the BHF and other aligned charities to maximise the impact of this project.

3) Medical Professionals and the NHS: Medical professionals could harness the information collected by individual's to remotely monitor their patients. Field studies could be setup with the NHS with the aim of identifying patients at risk of developing CVD who could implement behavioural changes to mitigate this occurrence. This would reduce hospital admissions, which costs approx. &amp;pound;4,614 per CVD event, and increase the patient's quality of life.

Indirect beneficiaries:

4) Energy Sector: Modernising our energy system is likely to save the UK &amp;pound;8 billion, within the next 6 years. The technical skills that will be developed during this project (signal processing, data visualisation and sensor systems) are transferrable and can be used by the team on joint projects been industry and academia, which can contribute in the long term to reducing carbon emissions. For instance, modelling the behaviour of a person is directly mirrored in monitoring the behaviour of homes.

Long term benefits within the next 10 - 50 years include direct interest from:

5) The General Public: Allowing individuals to be more in control of their health enables them to live healthier lives and would have a cascading effect on healthcare services. CVD is a substantial contributor to the escalating cost of healthcare in the UK (&amp;pound;8.6 billion), Europe (46 billion EUR) and America ($108.9 billion) annually. Using such a system and being in control of our health, by reflecting and altering behaviour, could reduce hospital admittance and the cost of ongoing care of this condition. 

6) Motor Industry: The case study and dataset can be used to understand the physiological responses of driving situations to assess the physiological impacts of stress on the driver. This would enable the development of more sophisticated car systems that could detect and react to the driver and to mitigate these feelings by, for example turning on soothing music.

7) Local Councils and Department for Transport (DfT): Comparing and aggregating the raw data can be generalised to the wellbeing of cities, towns and countries, if the technology is widely adopted. The health of commuters can be to pinpoint potential traffic danger zones. Local councils and the DfT could use this data to improve the roads so that areas are not a hotspot for aggression and stress.

Indirect beneficiaries:

8) Health insurance companies: Providing a system to increase our quality of life could lead to reduced insurance premiums, i.e. the healthier the user the less they pay. Insurance companies already use body mass index (BMI) to calculate premiums. However, using the platform would provide much richer data about our health, which could be used as a benchmark for calculating premiums.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98963</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ESF Science Meeting on Evaluating Personal Lifelogs (Glasgow)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB7E2C15-C294-441B-B67D-9B16943E7416</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This European invite-only event was held in conjunction with The 12th NTCIR Conference, which was held in Tokyo, Japan.

The team has been involved in presenting the project at a number of events for Sensor City. This is a new collaboration between the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University that aims to create a University Enterprise Zone whereby industry and academia can come together to create commercially viable solutions. One such event that the project has been presented at was, Doing Business with Sensor City, which attracted 100+ delegates from around the nation. The presentation of the project facilitated discussions with colleagues from industry, academia and clinicians about its applications within health and has led to the formulation of another funding proposal, which has been documented in the Other Outputs &amp;amp; Knowledge/Future Steps section. Attendance at another Sensor City event, Could you be EPIC? - Sensor City, has also facilitated talks for larger projects between the team and the international electronics, defense and telecommunications company Plessey.

The project has also been presented at the event, Together for manufacturing - the official launch of LCR 4.0. LCR 4.0 is part funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and is unique to the region. It allows regional businesses to access practical support and connect with other SMEs, as well as to utilize academic expertise in finding solutions to industrial challenges. This event attracted 50+ delegates from around the region and was composed of local SME's, as well as LCR 4.0 partners and the region's leading manufacturing experts.

The platform utilizes a number of wearable/mobile sensors to collect physiological and contextual lifelogging data from participants on their daily driving commute to and from work. This data includes acceleration, electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, as well as location and photographs of the road to ascertain the context of the drive. The development of this platform has met the first objective of the research.

A data processing pipeline has been created that pre-processes the sensor data to 1) filter noise, 2) calculate speed from the acceleration data, 3) calculate cardiovascular measures, including heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse transit time (PTT), 4) identify and correct artifacts, 5) extract features from the data and 6) synchronize the physiological with the contextual data. The development of this algorithm has met the second objective of the research.
An interactive interface has also been created that transforms the collected multivariate data into an interactive visualisation so participants can easily interpret the context of the drive for changing patterns of psychophysiology. The purpose of this has been to create a self-reflective tool whereby participants can reflect on their data and perhaps incite behavioural changes. For example, certain junctions might incite negative emotions and so by understanding this coping strategies may employed at this point, such as deep breathing. The development of this interface has met the third objective of the research.

In order to assess the validity of our approach, two real-world case studies have been undertaken that have focused on using our platform to collect a variety of lifelogging data from participants on their daily driving commute to and from work:
1. The purpose of study one was a data collection exercise. This study consisted of thirteen participants - seven female and six male, with an age range from 25 to 57 (mean = 42, SD = 12). Each participant undertook the study for five working days and recorded data during each of their driving journeys to and from work, i.e. ten drives (five morning and five evening) were recorded per participant. This study has resulted in the collection of 408,041,797 instances of raw lifelogging data.
2. The purpose of study two was to assess if the interactive visualisation influenced the participants behaviour. This study consisted of eight participants - six females and two males, with an age range from 28 to 57 (mean = 39.50, SD = 11.10). Each participant collected data for a total of four working days. The protocol required participants to collect data for two days, review their data via the visualization, and then collect data for a further two days. This study has resulted in the collection of 159,496,783 instances of raw lifelogging data.
A total of 567,538,580 instances of raw lifelogging data have been collected over the duration of the project. The completion of these studies has met the fourth objective of the research.

Preliminary analysis of study one's data has been reported in the paper:

Chelsea Dobbins and Stephen Fairclough, &amp;quot;A Mobile Lifelogging Platform to Measure Anxiety and Anger During Real-Life Driving&amp;quot; in the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom'17), Kona, Big Island, Hawaii, USA, 13th - 17th March, 2017 (Accepted)

This analysis has been undertaken in order to understand the relationship between the speed of the vehicle and cardiovascular parameters. In this case, mean vehicle speed within three-minute windows was captured as a proxy measure of journey impedance, i.e. lower mean speed = higher journey impedance. The purpose of the analysis was to quantify the relationship between vehicle speed and two measures of cardiovascular activity: heart rate (HR) and high frequency component of heart rate variability (HRV). Data from all ten journeys for each participant were subjected to a linear regression analysis, where mean speed acted as a dependent variable and HR and HRV acted as independent variables. The results indicated that low mean speed was associated with increased heart rate, which was indicative of anger due to journey impedance. On this basis, it was expected that inflammation would also increase when mean speed was low. However, the opposite pattern was observed and high mean speed was associated with low HRV. This unexpected result may be due to the influence of mental workload on cardiovascular activity. It could be assumed that driver mental workload increases with respect to information processing load as the driver travels at higher speed, hence the inverse relationship between speed and HRV. However, this link is speculative because mental workload is also strongly influenced by other factors, such as traffic density. Nevertheless, this preliminary data analyses has revealed supporting evidence that cardiovascular markers of anger were associated with reduced vehicle speed and journey impedance. 

The project has also contributed to the paper:

C. Dobbins and S. Fairclough, &amp;quot;Lifelogging Technologies to Detect Negative Emotions Associated with Cardiovascular Disease,&amp;quot; in Applied Computing in Medicine and Health, 1st ed., D. Al-Jumeily, A. Hussain, C. Mallucci, and C. Oliver, Eds. Elsevier, 2015, pp. 27-44.

This paper explores how lifelogging technologies can be used to monitor the physiological process of inflammation that is associated with negative emotion and deleterious consequences for long-term health. The article explores the technological challenges that are associated with this task and offers guidance on the design of a lifelogging technology that promotes effective self-reflection and protective coping.

The project has also been presented at the ESF Science Meeting on Evaluating Personal Lifelogs in Glasgow, which was held in conjunction with The 12th NTCIR Conference that was being held in Tokyo, Japan. The PI was personally invited by the organizers to give a talk about the project. The event was an opportunity for international colleagues to present their research, as well as a networking in the broader field of lifelogging and quantified self.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have been taken forward into the formulation of a larger EPSRC proposal that is building on the techniques obtained through this project.
