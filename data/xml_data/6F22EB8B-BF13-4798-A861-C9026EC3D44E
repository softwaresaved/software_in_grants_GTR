It is particularly concerned with the role of such artistic 'interventions' in challenging dominant ways of seeing, understanding and using urban spaces, and in imagining and realizing alternatives. Through a focus primarily on cases from London and New York, the project addresses the role of artistic and spatial practices in tracing out other possibilities in cities, whether that is in the context of heightened security and increasing electronic surveillance of public space (in relation to which I ask, how might artistic performances play upon, question or even subvert that process?); or the 'packaging' of cities for touristic and heritage spectacle (how might different memories of cities be presented and performed through strategies of tours and guided walks?); or the remaking of neighbourhoods through urban restructuring and gentrification (how can different stories and accounts of the process find a voice through forms of urban documentation?). \n\nThe project seeks to contribute to key current debates about cities and urban cultures in geography, cultural studies and related arts, cultural and political fields by developing understandings of how urban public spaces in contemporary capitalist cities are imagined, experienced and the subject of political conflict and struggles. In particular, it traces out practices that embody a struggle for a more vibrant, democratic urban public sphere against those processes that close it down, and as such it seeks to provide glimpses of other possible urban worlds. The project marks a significant development of my earlier research interest in utopian visions of cities, which led to my book Visions of the City (2005). As opposed to utopian visions based on grand plans and blueprints, the new project is concerned with a form of utopianism that seeks inspiration from the streets and everyday urban spaces, and addresses what is possible within present conditions. It is also interested in the potential contribution of a growing dialogue between artists, cultural practitioners and academics around critical analysis of cities to contribute to this endeavour. \n\nThe research project will be completed through the writing of four closely connected papers. It will also involve dissemination through presentations and talks. While each of these papers takes a different angle and focuses on different artists and events, the papers are bound together by their shared concern with the possibilities contained within cities and urban spaces, and with the potential role of artistic and cultural practices in questioning or challenging powerful interests that influence city life so that something other might emerge. The papers also have many shared reference points, a key one of which is the practice of 'psychogeography'. Initially developed during the 1950s and 1960s by the avant-garde groups, the Letterist and Situationist Internationals, its multiple roots and routes are manifest in three of the papers, and it is the subject of direct investigation and analysis in a fourth.\n\nOne intended outcome of the research project is to develop connections and collaborative links with colleagues in other disciplines concerned with these research questions, in particular those within performance, urban studies and the visual arts, as well as artists and cultural practitioners working in this field. More specifically, an aim is to contribute and significantly advance the research programme at the new City Centre at Queen Mary, University of London, which is itself seeing to establish connections within and beyond academia, and which has as one of its major research strands 'Art, performance and representation'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25774</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E004725/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8990E5FE-B44F-4A5B-8FDE-0610A5BE98C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
