There is growing recognition that traditional measures of economic growth (like GDP) do not necessarily imply improving quality of life across the population. In acknowledgement of this, the UK government has committed to improving their understanding of personal 'wellbeing'. In general terms, wellbeing refers to the extent to which people's lives are going well and this can be affected by lifestyle practices that may influence physical or mental health. Given that commuting is a regularly repeated activity for the working population, it has been suggested that certain travel behaviours, such as long commutes or cycling regularly, could worsen or improve an individual's health and wellbeing over time. However, good evidence is lacking to confirm this. 

The study will make use of the Understanding Society study, a unique data resource that has been tracking the lives of members of 40,000 households since 2009/10. The same participants have been surveyed once every year, making it possible to understand how and why their lives are changing over time. The proposed study will analyse the first six waves of Understanding Society data. The analysis will identify how the commuting behaviours of employed adults have changed over the period and establish whether and how commuting has affected different aspects of their personal wellbeing. The longitudinal data will allow analysis which considers whether effect takes place after cause and whether greater exposure leads to larger effect. These criteria for causation have not been tested previously. For instance the study will examine if individuals with longer commute times suffer from higher stress levels and reduced leisure time and consequently report lower personal wellbeing overall. By comparison, do those that start walking to work feel that their physical health improves and stress levels reduce, and hence report better wellbeing overall? The study will seek to address such questions. 

The proposed research has been co-designed by a research team from the University of the West of England (UWE) and policy researchers at the Department for Transport (DfT). DfT has identified specific evidence needs relating to commuting and wellbeing. The research team comprises travel behaviour experts and statisticians from UWE, a health economist from Rand Europe (Adam Martin), and Dr Adrian Davis, an expert in the relationship between transport and health. DfT will chair a project steering group and be joined as project partner by Department of Health and What Works Centre for Wellbeing. A stakeholder interest group will also ensure close links with policy and practice over the course of the study, Outputs from the project will include policy briefing notes and policy toolkit, co-produced by the project partners and the team of researchers. This will showcase new evidence on the relationships between commuting and wellbeing and be used in practice to identify policies and interventions to improve wellbeing through 'healthy commuting' across the working population.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will generate a detailed understanding of how commuting behaviours impact on personal wellbeing. The main beneficiaries of this evidence will be policy makers and delivery agents with interests in transport, employment and public health, working at national and local levels. The evidence will be used to identify policies and interventions to improve wellbeing through 'healthy commuting'.

The proposal has been co-produced with our national policy partners - the Department for Transport (DfT) (lead policy partner), Department of Health (DH), and the What Works Centre for Wellbeing (WWCW) - with their specific evidence needs in mind. The policy partners will be represented on a project steering group, convened at the beginning of the study and chaired by the DfT. The steering group will meet every three months to assist with shaping the research activities (most crucially at the project outset) and to ensure that the study delivers cross-cutting policy relevant insights. 

To ensure broader engagement with the full range of organizations with interests in transport, health and employment (both governmental and non-governmental), a Special Interest Group (SIG) will also be convened (represented by for example, the Chartered Institute of Highways and Transport, Confederation of British Industry). The SIG will receive summaries from each of the substantive work packages and SIG members will also be invited to attend a policy workshop. This will provide a forum for transport and public health practitioners to examine the new evidence on commuting and wellbeing and to identify policy actions. The outcomes from the workshop will be documented in an online 'commuting and wellbeing policy toolkit', communicating key findings and mapping these to policy objectives and suggested interventions.

Dr Ben Clark will spend five days embedded at the DfT to co-develop policy briefing notes and slide packs. Findings will also be presented at an end of project showcase. Representatives from relevant government departments and academia will be invited to attend. The briefing notes and slide packs will be published on a project website as well as the Local Government Association Knowledge Hub to ensure that the findings reach local government officers working in transport, employment and public health. 

In addition to the direct benefits of the new evidence, the project will generate a longitudinal data set (complete with linked-data from external data sources) ready for further analyses of travel behaviour and wellbeing. A training event will be held to ensure that policy analysts are aware of the data potential and how it may be exploited. The research team will also identify data gaps and provide recommendations on beneficial new data and how it may be generated.

There is worldwide interest among transport researchers on how travel influences wellbeing. UWE will invite researchers working in this area to participate in an international workshop on the theme of travel behaviour and wellbeing. Researchers will benefit from the opportunity to learn about the latest research methods and findings. At least three academic journal papers will be produced and presented at academic conferences spanning the disciplines of transport and health.

The project team will also seek opportunities to engage directly with the public on how individuals can achieve 'healthy commuting'. This will be through collaboration with the WWCW, who have experience of securing funding for wellbeing public dialogue projects. Newsworthy developments will be publicised to the general media via press releases. Finally, a non-technical article summarising key findings will be submitted for publication in a practitioner periodical.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>US Transportation Research Board Conference 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7B8A4496-9DEC-4100-B7A2-DB2B75D282E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An international audience of around 100 academics and practitioners attended our presentation on the relationship between commute duration and life satisfaction.

The presentation prompted a discussion of the role of commuting in public health policy. There was particular interest in our estimates of the monetary value of commute time. This has led to further dialogue with civil servants from the Treasury and the Department for Transport. We are jointly examining the potential to develop new methods of valuing commute time using revealed preference surveys like the UK Household Longitudinal Study.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-impacts-task-force-update-on-recent-work</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N012429/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C5394E1-D713-4507-8021-0A9785789545</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transport Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>748617DE-4AB0-42C9-9514-B22ECFBE05E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transport Ops &amp; Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
