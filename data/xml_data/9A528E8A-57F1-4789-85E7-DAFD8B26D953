ESTEM) for Dynamic In-Situ Reaction Studies of Nanoparticle Catalysts</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J018058/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>We propose to create in the UK a novel research capability providing Angstrom Analysis for dynamic in-situ reaction studies under controlled conditions of temperature and continuous gas atmosphere rather than the usual high vacuum. The new design provides the world's first full function aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). In association with partners in the vibrant UK chemical and energy industries we will generate fundamental application science underpinning nanoparticle based solid state heterogeneous catalysis used in gas-solid reactions. We will modify an existing AC TEM/STEM instrument to complement and extend with gas reaction studies the National AC STEM Facility's superior image and energy resolutions in high vacuum. It will be used in York programmes and collaborative projects with other groups through the AC STEM. It builds on the PIs' established reputations for global leadership in ETEM, with most of the worldwide activity to date - all overseas - based on &amp;gt;10 high resolution ETEMs and many of them AC (on the TEM image side only), using core technology from the authors' earlier developments. Preliminary 'proof-of-principle' has been demonstrated on the remotely controlled double aberration corrected JEOL 2200FS TEM/STEM at York; combining sub-Angstrom (&amp;lt;0.1nm) resolution, unrestricted HAADF Z-contrast STEM imaging, wide angle electron diffraction and EDX (+ EELS) chemical analysis not available on ETEMs. The double aberration correction collects, in a single and often directly interpretable TEM image, a full range of spatial frequencies at close to zero defocus to minimise image delocalisation at internal interfaces such as grain boundaries, external surfaces, defects and other key discontinuities. This is especially important for dynamic in-situ studies with continuously changing data making impractical older through-focal series reconstruction methods. AC also transforms the sensitivity of STEM analysis. The work will use analytical methods established with 'frozen' and process extracted samples, and apply them to the study of continuous processes at new levels of sensitivity and relevance. Access to key intermediate states and phases may be critical to understand and control process mechanisms; but they may be metastable with respect to conditions, including temperature or chemical environment, and therefore not accessible through ex-situ or pulse studies. A very practical example, in which there is leading UK industry interest and support, is the nano-structure and related property stability of supported metal nanoparticle heterogeneous catalysts. Through synthesis, activation, operation, deactivation, reactivation and recovery mechanisms, understanding at a fundamental level is critical for managing on a rational basis industrial practice for sustained activity and selectivity; and where necessary recovering these key attributes when lost. The project direction is closely aligned with the domain science needs of real world academic and industrial applications, and there are early adoption prospects for underpinning key technologies; including to extend useful process life cycles. For example, this is critical for the wider commercial viability of fuel cells. The proposal has the support of leading UK companies in the vibrant and internationally competitive chemical industry sector, and of academic collaborators. At the same time, the new learnings in basic domain science are also directed towards opening up new applications of pressing societal value in the environment. Fundamental physical science research with strategic and tactical industrial applications leads to differentiated intellectual products with an initiative unique in the UK and fully competitive globally. The project will extend and apply core nanoparticle catalysis science and technology, and train a new cohort of students, postdocs, senior staff and visitors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project introduces to the UK AC ETEM and to the World full function AC ESTEM, in combination as AC (E(S)TEM), with a continuous controlled gas environment around the specimen for dynamic in-situ reaction studies of heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts and related materials. AC ESTEM will have 0.1nm resolution HAADF Z-contrast imaging with single atom sensitivity, EDX chemical analysis and wide angle electron diffraction with CBDP. This will complement and extend application specific technical capabilities of the established EPSRC National Facility for high performance AC STEM and will be co-ordinated with that programme. We will work with partners in UK academia to provide wider access in the UK to the innovative new capability. Our project is focused on new methods of fundamental science applied to important heterogeneous catalyst technology applications in collaboration with leading British companies, whose expertise, interests and needs are contributing significantly to the planning, implementation, development and exploitation of the project initiative. The original partners, providing CASE studentships, are the catalyst businesses of Johnson Matthey and BP. Discussions with Shell are at an earlier stage. All three companies have staff involved with the laboratory work, the provision of materials synthesised for specific designs of experiment, access to other characterisation methods and broad catalyst performance characterisation. This means we can leverage resources and expertise without the need to establish them ourselves, and more effectively expose our students and staff to well established practices. The impact for each company will include (a) direct and specific tactical support for technology developments, (b) targeted background domain science, in some cases pre-competitive, to inform longer term strategic decisions, and (c) reputational association with the project, (d) results from it and where appropriate to refer problems to it. There is scope for new and more effective solutions to long standing problems in the chemical industry, new energy initiatives, in the environment and in remediation. The whole of Society (the people, companies and Government) stands to benefit above and beyond immediate operational profit in terms of lower cost and more efficient energy systems, cleaner emissions, more efficient, lower cost and more complete chemical reaction processes, with less waste products, and generally more stable and benign operations. The project needs to engage with all stakeholders to define and to implement beneficial solutions to underlying problems. Everyone benefits from new products and better chemical production processes with reduced waste and energy requirements. We propose to hold focus groups and targeted meetings to promote the agenda and generally to extend the benefits of the research. We will engage with wider activities of outreach. A major activity for which some funding support is requested, is to engage with the world wide scientific community by attending international conferences, especially in Europe, the US and Asia. We are organising sections of the next European Microscopy Congress, to be held in Manchester in Sept 2012, and if we are successful with funding this will be a suitable occasion for a very public launch of the project. We have established with each company pathways for interactions at the tactical, laboratory scale, and strategically at more senior corporate levels; informed by our own experiences at senior technical levels on major projects in (US) industry (see cvs). The most immediate impacts will be directly with the sponsoring organisations to inform decisions about current practices and future technology developments. This will be achieved by close contact in meetings, and in joint laboratory work, with senior management and technical staff from each company separately; and together at the pre-competitive stage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1372980</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>award interviews by media: TV, Newspapers, Radio.</gtr:description><gtr:id>151E2718-9D6C-47FF-AF76-FE0587ADF519</gtr:id><gtr:impact>L'Oreal-UNESCO award interviews by media: TV, Newspapers, Radio.

In chemical technology heterogeneous catalysts consisting of nano-scale particles operate in gas atmospheres and at elevated temperatures. Cutting edge fundamental science is needed to understand and improve performance of the behaviour of these catalysts in controlled reaction environments, to support internationally competitive chemical process industries in the UK. 

As part of our EPSRC award EP/ EP/J018058/1, we have developed, for the first time globally, aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC ESTEM) instrumentation. This project has established in the UK the world's first atomic resolution (AC) E(S)TEM capability and we are making it increasingly widely available to colleagues in the UK and in collaborations internationally. The AC ESTEM capabilities include, atomic scale imaging and analysis under controlled conditions of gas environment around the specimen held at high temperature. The new facilities operate under a sub set of realistic reaction conditions with single atom sensitivity. Include are Z-contrast high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM imaging, energy dispersive x-ray chemical analysis and wide angle electron diffraction (including CBDP), as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The project is designed to generate for the first time and in close collaboration with the vibrant UK catalysis and chemicals industry, fundamental and practical atomic scale understanding of key preparative, activation, reaction, deactivation and where practical reactivation processes. Analysis of real world practices show considerable scope for improvement in deploying resources, including the amount of precious metals needed for automotive exhaust emissions controls.

Our novel AC ESTEM development is enabling research on gas-solid reactions with single atom resolution in many technologically important chemical reactions which were hitherto unknown. Training of students and young researchers is being carried out. 
Collaborations with other UK Universities including White Rose Universities and the UK chemical and energy industries are in progress. Several joint publications have resulted. 
The research has received international recognition with the award of L'Oreal-UNESCO women in science award as the 2013 Laureate for Europe for Prof Gai (one female scientist is selected from each continent); elections to the Fellowships of the Royal Academy of Engineering; The Institute of Physics, The Institute of Materials, Minerals and mining and so on.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>PhD students and postdoctoral research fellows, visiting researchers, industrial collaborations</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>03C0E0A1-32DD-4E51-8312-E12E4958AE60</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of working party on advanced electron microscopy in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>251FCD8A-F990-4289-B6B0-5C0CDB917954</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Guidelines for future sustainable investment in the field of reserach</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>SuperStem</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A4AF361-1A66-4DB9-9CFB-386D2B5FDD2B</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Computational models for strain analysis in nanoparticles (Nanoletters Vol 12, p.2027, 2012) and models of ceria vacancies in gold ceria catalysts(Catal Sc and Tech.

Development of novel AC E(S)TEM :
We have modified an existing AC TEM/STEM instrument to complement and extend its capabilities with gas reaction studies while maintaining, and in some aspects extending the full performance and functionality of the core tool. Our new design provides the world's first full function aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). The global competition (approx. 20 labs, all overseas -including Europe, USA, Japan) continues to use a version of our earlier ETEM design which is in practice high resolution in TEM only and come with a single aberration corrector for TEM imaging. The old design has significant analytical and imaging limitations which make it unsuitable for multi-user environments; to the extent several laboratories have a dedicated machine (as we did with the original) and second instrument for other uses. This is expensive in both capital and operating costs as well as in real estate and support needs. With the modifications to the machine at York, ETEM is also (re-) introduced into the UK in high resolution form. Perhaps more significantly, cost-wise, the full ESTEM functionality also supports full STEM for the parallel high vacuum operations. This in itself is major advantage of the new developments which not only enable the new functionalities but also support a much wider and more intensive utilisation of the capital kit investment in multi-use applications, as well as ensuring the support coats are spread over as wide a range of applications as possible. In association with partners in the vibrant UK chemical and energy industries we are generating fundamental application science underpinning nanoparticle based solid state heterogeneous catalysis used in gas-solid reactions. Our primary industry partners are Johnson Matthey Plc.
With the award of the grant in 2012 we began construction of modifications beyond the very limited proof-of-principle demonstrations for gas operations on the multi-use high resolution microscope in our laboratory at York. 

The year 2013 saw the launch of our aberration corrected ESTEM as a scientifically useful capability. Further improvements to the new core capability and to support other uses of the capital kit, with a minimum of compromises and crucially without the need to change the machine configuration for different applications, are continuing. For example there is a simple and rapid switch over from gas-mode to high vacuum mode.

Phase one technical developments on the microscope have been successfully completed and they have produced a first high profile application publication by E D Boyes and P L Gai et al in Annalen der Physik in June 2013. With the developments we have created a world leading new ESTEM functionality without compromising other attributes for these and other applications on the existing high vacuum multi-user machine. 

Recent progress with the new generation of MEMS hot stages we have been able to purchase with the grant (substituting for part of the originally proposed old technology), has been transformational in what we can do scientifically, in productivity and with most of the technical support by ourselves on site rather than regular sagas of return- to-foreign-factory for service. This development makes it practical to track areas continuously over time and during temperature transits, with especial relevance to comparison data for the MC calculations; themselves not part of the project but augmenting it through studentships.

The science the new capabilities open up is exciting. AC ESTEM provides a key tool for the study of single atoms in catalysts under reaction conditions with the ability to analyse the structure of the nanoparticles. This is a novel and very important development in terms of impact. As well as new information on the migration of materials from one discrete, in this case metal, nanoparticle to another; it shows the importance of these species leading to active sites. This work relates to parallel on-going Monte Carlo (MC) calculations and provides important input for further calculations of functionality and specific chemical reactivity; through for example the density functional theory (DFT) methods we used for catalytic nanoparticles (at that time studied with temperature and without gas) in our 2012 Nanoletters paper (vol. 12, p.2027). In 2014 further technical developments on the microscope have increased the gas pressures inside the microscope (as outlined in our EPSRC grant proposal) and resulted in high profile publications in the first quarter of 2014, including in Comptes Rendu Phys. by E D Boyes and P L Gai (15, p.200, 2014) and MRS Bull. 40, 600 (2015). This has also been the time for ramping up the PDRA supported applications of the new kit developments. 4x PDRAs have now been appointed; all of them experienced electron microscopists with application domain science backgrounds in nanoparticle physics and chemistry for catalysis. In this we have been most fortunate.

Our AC ESTEM development has led to the support for continuing as associate partner of EPSRC SuperSTEM at Daresbury, as the in-situ component of the EPSRC National facility for aberration corrected electron microscopy. Project work with Leeds and Sheffield are ongoing on this. 
There has been significant industrial collaboration leading to joint publications with Johnson Matthey Plc, a FTSE 100 company and world leader in precious metals and catalysis. JM was also a strong supporter of our grant proposal and the interaction continues to be further strengthened at the strategic and tactical levels. The latter include CASE studentships, access to their extensive technical resources for both specimen preparation (including custom preparation to our specifications where needed) and testing, and regular direct technical work for which they pay the University.

The grant holders- Professors Gai and Boyes' track record as world leaders in this field has been recognised by the award of the biannual Institute of Physics Gabor medal and prize in September 2010, Fellowship of the Institute of Physics (EDB); L'Oreal-UNESCO Women in Science award as the 2013 Laureate for Europe (PLG); the Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Engineering (PLG); and the EPSRC sponsored committee membership on the future of advanced electron microscopy in the UK (EDB).

The work has led to the establishment in the UK of the leading centre globally for high resolution dynamic in-situ reaction and other phase transformation studies under controlled conditions of gas atmosphere and temperature. With this project we have introduced the first environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (ESTEM) instrumentation with 0.1nm resolution and single atom sensitivity for dynamic in-situ experiments on heterogeneous catalysts under controlled conditions of gas atmosphere and of high temperatures.

Significant parts of the chemical and energy industries, in which the UK is internationally competitive, depend on heterogeneous catalysis based on active nanoparticles, often of metal, dispersed on a support which is typically carbon or ceramic oxide supports. Small particles in the low nanometre range have size dependent properties; sometimes of character and always of surface area for a given volume. There is always a battle between initial effectiveness, measured in activity and selectivity, and structural and chemical stability; in the process unfortunately but correctly defying the textbook definition of a catalyst as unchanging. 

Electron microscopy is a leading method of studying such materials, and the authors (PI and CoI) of this project have led its adaptation globally for purpose over three decades. The principle development has been to create differentially pumped instrumentation in which dynamic in-situ reaction study experiments can be performed with atomic resolution under controlled conditions of temperature and most importantly of gas atmosphere; replacing the usual, and chemically alien, high vacuum atomic resolution analytical instrument environment. 
These developments allow chemically active species to be created and studied in-situ, rather than optimistically required to be transferred into the analytical system through air without modification. Details of their development or activation, subsequent operation and eventual deactivation, and even reactivation and precious metals recovery, can be followed through dynamic sequences in ESTEM. This allows much more reliable and insightful experiments than would otherwise be possible, and indeed some prior art studies have had to be substantially revised on this basis; for example by clearly separating (and correcting) reaction causes and effects.
 
We have now made further significant advances in the method with a radical new approach to system engineering. Most importantly this allows, we believe for the first time, full integration with a double aberration corrected TEM/STEM instrument at 0.1nm resolution in both modes. This enables the first high performance E(S)TEM (environmental (scanning) transmission electron microscopy) in the world.

A major advance with the new approach has been to enable full use of the atomic resolution and atomic number (Z) contrast high angle annular dark field (HAADF) with single atom sensitivity, which is key to understanding reaction mechanisms. This is not possible with the previous designs being used around the world which are configured primarily for high resolution TEM, rather than STEM imaging. Most such systems used globally are copies of earlier designs of atomic resolution-ETEM pioneered by Boyes and Gai; most cogently described in references [E D Boyes and P L Gai, Ultramicroscopy, 92, 67 (1997); P L Gai, E D Boyes, et al. MRS Bulletin 32(no.12): 1044 (2007) and P L Gai et al Science, 67, p.661]. We are therefore well aware of the strengths - and weaknesses - of these systems in which global investment now amounts to many 10s of millions of &amp;pound;, including in continental Europe, Japan and the US. To date there have been no high performance ETEMs in the UK where the situation is a regression from where the authors left it in the late 1980s. Since then the steady expansion and recent explosion in ETEM activities has been exclusively overseas. An incidental impact, but one of some considerable significance, is likely to be a cohort of younger researchers exposed to the 'can-do' spirit that it is very desirable, and indeed doable, to reconfigure even sophisticated apparatus for specific significant purpose, and in the process gain a personal and institutional competitive advantage. As in the current project, this approach, done right, can substantially extend the productive life of core capital kit by adapting it for specific purpose. All useful learnings from the project.

With the new configuration, parallel high performance chemical analysis by energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDX) is also made possible for the first time in an E(S)TEM. This is additionally important since the modus operandi, in part for reliability and in part to optimise capital investment in multiple application domain sciences, is to leave the E(S)TEM components permanently mounted in the column and to operate interchangeably with and without a gas environment for experiments with different needs. EDX is an important complement to any high resolution STEM study and its inclusion on the new machine is therefore especially important; in addition to introducing its direct use in chemical experiments including dynamic in-situ catalysis studies. The restriction on gas pressures to &amp;lt;0.1 torr this entails is still well within the 'high' pressure (&amp;gt;0.001 torr) region of surface studies, as defined in the literature [PCCP 9, 3500-3513, (2007)], although of course much less than used in some commercial reactors. The connection is through the science. 
The new activities are becoming a magnet for broad scientific interest to generate an impressive showpiece for British science both through its output and its physical presence.

In addition to our novel instrumental development, this project is focused on new methods of fundamental science applied to technology applications in collaboration with leading UK companies, whose expertise, interests and needs are contributing significantly to the planning, implementation, development and exploitation of the novel AC E(S)TEM development. 
Other areas of impact of this project include:
? training of a cohort of students, PDRAs, visiting scientists and academic colleagues
? the establishment in the UK the global centre of excellence in this aspect of in-situ catalysis science and of the experimental methods on which it is based
? the extension of the science base on the structure and stability of the smaller sizes, generally &amp;lt;10nm, of nanoparticles on various supports of practical significance
? the AC E(S)TEM development is playing a key role in understanding atomic reaction mechanisms in the following York programmes in collaboration with the UK chemical industry. Examples include: (a) AC ESTEM imaging of single atoms under controlled temperature and gas environment conditions in catalyst reaction studies. (Ann.Phys. (Berlin) 525, 423 (2013). and Chemical Physics Letters (592, 355, 2014); (b) Understanding atomic scale interactions in electrode catalysts for fuel cells in reduction and oxidation environments using AC E(S)TEM: (c) Visualisation and analysis of single atom dynamics in water gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO+H2O? CO2+H2) for hydrogen generation important to fuel cells using AC E(S)TEM. Here the in-situ atomic resolution observations on practical gold/ceria catalysts have revealed the formation of clusters of a few gold atoms from single atom dynamics under controlled WGS environments at operating temperatures influencing the WGS catalysis(Catal Sc. Tech.2015; DOI: 10.1039/c5cy01154j; in collaboration with Johnson Matthey). 

Direct technological applications of the science in industrial catalysis practice with economic and profit advantages for industrial practitioners better informed by project results.

-These include identification of key nanostructures and their composition in the function and deactivation of diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC) employed for auto-exhaust emission control.

The gas-catalyst reactions take place at the atomic level. World leading fundamental science of the gas-catalyst reactions at the atomic level under controlled reaction environments is therefore needed to understand and develop improved catalysts and processes to support internationally competitive chemical process industries in the UK. 

The importance of heterogeneous catalysis is recognised in EPSRC research theme roadmaps (as one of the relatively few established areas of science continuing to be selected to GROW) and the field supports the very competitive catalysis industry in the UK. 

As part of our very successful EPSRC grant EP/ EP/J018058/1 we (the PI and CoI (Professor Gai and Professor Boyes) have invented, designed, constructed the world's first aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC ESTEM) instrumentation at Yok. This project has established in the UK the world's first atomic resolution (AC) E(S)TEM capability. The main goals as well as some useful key extensions of our ambitious project have been fully accomplished on the planned timescale and resource base to create a new world leading facility and use it to enable important new science highly pertinent to the science behind heterogeneous catalysis based on metal nanoparticles. The ground-breaking AC ESTEM capabilities include, atomic scale imaging and analysis under controlled realistic reaction conditions of gas environment around the specimen held at high temperature with single atom sensitivity, energy dispersive x-ray chemical analysis and wide angle electron diffraction (including CBDP), as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).
We are exploiting the catalyst science relevant to the UK industry, instrumentation and methods using the ESTEM [3-8, 10-12, 14,15]. The project is designed to generate for the first time and in close collaboration with the UK catalysis and chemicals industry, fundamental and practical atomic scale understanding of key preparative, activation, reaction, deactivation and where practical reactivation processes. Analysis of real world practices show considerable scope for improvement in deploying resources, including the amount of precious metals needed for automotive exhaust emissions controls. We are also making our ESTEM development available to colleagues in the UK academia and in collaborations internationally.
The modern era in the field started with the development of the atomic resolution, TEM only, gas-in-microscope ETEM (Environmental Transmission Electron Microscope, ETEM), introduced by Boyes and Gai in the USA in the 1990s [1, 2]. The model is now widely used in commercial form (FEI) at a unit cost of ~&amp;pound;5M; with ~20x based on our work, further instruments being acquired and &amp;gt;100 high impact publications now resulting. There are dedicated units in Asia, USA and Europe, in academia and industry, but currently there are none in the UK and our ESTEM development is the first such instrument in the UK. 
(Described in the Details section below).
(In Manchester, Johnson Matthey/Harwell) there are two limited commercial gas specimen holder systems, based on the work of Cremer [16a] and Bigelow [16b,19], but with limited gas-handing and analytical capabilities).
Under the EPSRC ESTEM Catalysis grant, EP/J018058/1 we have constructed and have begun to apply key technical developments on the core aberration corrected JEOL 2200 STEM (+TEM) electron microscope. For the first time globally using an electron microscope, catalysts can be analysed with sub-&amp;Aring;ngstrom resolution and reliable single atom sensitivity under a selected sub-set of controlled chemical reaction conditions [3-6]. Continuous gas exposure floods the catalyst with reactants at elevated temperature under dynamic real time in-situ reaction conditions. 
With the just concluded York grant EP/J018058/1 the ETEM has been given a very significant application driven redesign to include for the first time a full set of previously absent but scientifically informative ESTEM imaging and analytical functions. We have made opportunistic custom modifications to a 200KV JEOL 2200FS platform, with Cs aberration correction for both the TEM image and STEM probe, to create the powerful and global pioneer ESTEM (Environmental Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope) with full STEM imaging and analysis. It has been created in-house at modest cost, since the core instrument and specialised site capital investments were already in place, and it operates under controlled working catalyst conditions of high temperature and continuously flowing gas sample environment [3, 4].:
Details
Development of our novel AC E(S)TEM instrument:
With the support of the previous EPSRC grant, EP/J018058/1, and derived from the approach we developed for the original atomic resolution ETEM [1 ,2], we have designed and built in-house in York the world's first aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). It is designed to provide ground breaking new capability and new levels of analysis in heterogeneous catalysis; targeted to new developments in catalysis science understanding and practice. It is a powerful new class of instrument with single atom sensitive analyses under controlled continuous gas reaction conditions at high temperatures. 

To achieve this we have modified an existing AC TEM/STEM instrument to complement and extend its capabilities with gas reaction studies while maintaining, and in some aspects extending the full performance and functionality of the core tool. Our new design provides the world's first full function aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). The global competition (approx. 20 labs, all overseas -including Europe, USA, Japan) continues to use a version of our (Boyes and Gai) earlier ETEM design which is in practice high resolution in TEM only and come with a single aberration corrector for TEM imaging. The old design has significant analytical and imaging limitations which make it unsuitable for multi-user environments; to the extent several laboratories have a dedicated machine (as we did with the original) and second instrument for other uses. This is expensive in both capital and operating costs as well as in real estate and support needs. 
With the modifications to the machine at York, ETEM is also (re-) introduced into the UK in high resolution form. Perhaps more significantly, cost-wise, the full ESTEM functionality also supports full STEM for the parallel high vacuum operations. This in itself is major advantage of the new developments which not only enable the new functionalities but also support a much wider and more intensive utilisation of the capital kit investment in multi-use applications, as well as ensuring the support coats are spread over as wide a range of applications as possible. In association with partners in the vibrant UK chemical and energy industries we are generating fundamental application science underpinning nanoparticle based solid state heterogeneous catalysis used in gas-solid reactions. Our primary industry partners are Johnson Matthey Plc.
With the award of the grant in 2012 we began construction of modifications beyond the very limited proof-of-principle demonstrations for gas operations on the multi-use high resolution microscope in our laboratory at York. The year 2013 saw the launch of our aberration corrected ESTEM as a scientifically useful capability. Further improvements to the new core capability and to support other uses of the capital kit, with a minimum of compromises and crucially without the need to change the machine configuration for different applications, are continuing. For example there is a simple and rapid switch over from gas-mode to high vacuum mode.
Phase one technical developments on the microscope were successfully completed and they have produced a first high profile application publication by E D Boyes and P L Gai et al in Annalen der Physik in June 2013. With the developments we have created a world leading new ESTEM functionality without compromising other attributes for these and other applications on the existing high vacuum multi-user machine. 
Recent progress with the new generation of MEMS hot stages we have been able to purchase with the grant (substituting for part of the originally proposed old technology), has been transformational in what we can do scientifically, in productivity and with most of the technical support by ourselves on site rather than regular sagas of return- to-foreign-factory for service. This development makes it practical to track areas continuously over time and during temperature transits, with especial relevance to comparison data for the MC calculations; themselves not part of the project but augmenting it through studentships.


Summary of Approach
Atom-by-atom analysis of dynamic catalysts in controlled reaction environments
The world's first sub-Angstrom atomic resolution Aberration Corrected Environmental Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (AC ESTEM) has been designed built and applied by Professor Gai and Professor Boyes, very economically based on the existing conventional high vacuum 200kV JEOL 2200 FS instrument with aberration correctors for the TEM image and STEM probe. It probably remains the only combination globally of the ambitious specification of retaining, and in important ways enhancing, the full performance and resolution of the original core instrument and improving aspects of the analysis capability while adding controlled continuous hot stage and gas atmosphere dynamic in-situ chemical reaction facilities at the sample; supported by multiple stages of differential pumping. 
 With the new instrumentation created under the EPSRC grant we have delivered major scientific applications in catalysis science for which we designed the novel AC ESTEM system - see for example the references to this report numbers [4-7;11,12,14,15], with others in preparation for publication. 
World leading research has been enabled by the also world leading instrument innovations and suitable engineering and support structures. This has probably involved more in-house development of the instrumentation than in any other laboratory outside Japan; and even of most (all?) there too. The reasoning for adopting this approach has been multi-fold: to support innovative competitive advantages for York's research capabilities; to tailor this to specific project needs and for its own sake; to speed up innovation compared to trying to work with manufacturer lead developments and worse for a small team to simply follow in a moneywise costly manufacturer lead programme like everyone else and also inevitably not to be at the head of that queue. A further driver has been to try to make best use of limited resources and in the process follow the only available path for the innovations in capability development and science applications to happen in York and perhaps in the UK at all. Certainly, without massive additional resources. Finally, this approach is built on York strengths, both in the immediate team and institutionally, in the way we can best provide competitive advantage for ourselves, for the science, for the UK and we suggest for the well-directed funding from the EPSRC.
 The key science application result is currently seen to have been to reveal the continuing presence of a population of single atoms on the support between established more substantial nanoparticles, e.g. of Pt or Cu on carbon, but likely also more generally, at temperature in a gas atmosphere under controlled in-situ dynamic chemical reaction conditions. This is a major result with many implications and directions for further applications.
 In the AC ESTEM samples of catalytic materials can follow a similar profile to that typical in a full scale chemical reactor with transfer of precursor(s) under air, it's subsequent activation in a continuous in-situ sequence inside the microscope (or it's directly connected antechamber) under the appropriate (often hydrogen) gas atmosphere followed by reaction which over time may lead to some deactivation with potential for amelioration better informed by the intimate new atom-by-atom analysis of the basis of the processes. This contrasts with other approaches involving cycling of samples through air and high vacuum environments or of restricted microscopy functionalities.
 The project has been structured around a series of strategic strands, extended with tactical sub-strands, based on the novel capabilities at York for environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy (ESTEM) with atomic resolution and sensitivity:

? Atomic scale characterisation of real, industry sourced, catalyst materials and processes
? Fundamental studies of processes, including revisiting basic models, on the atom-by-atom scale using model samples based on industrial process chemistry and focus issues
? Development of infrastructure, instrumentation and methods to enable the research
? Promoting collaborations with UK and overseas colleagues to widen impact of the ESTEM development.
Additional details of research:
We are exploiting in catalyst science relevant to UK industry, instrumentation and methods created under the very successful EPSRC ESTEM Catalysis critical mass grant, EP/J018058/1 now concluding. With this we have invented, designed, constructed and have begun to apply key technical developments on the core aberration corrected JEOL 2200 STEM (+TEM) electron microscope. For the first time globally using an electron microscope, catalysts can be analysed with sub-angstrom resolution and reliable single atom sensitivity under a selected sub-set of controlled chemical reaction conditions [3-6]. Continuous gas exposure floods the catalyst with reactants at elevated temperature under dynamic real time in-situ reaction conditions 
 With the just concluding York grant the ETEM has been given a very significant application driven redesign to include for the first time a full set of previously absent but scientifically informative ESTEM imaging and analytical functions. We have made opportunistic custom modifications to a 200KV JEOL 2200FS platform, with Cs aberration correction for both the TEM image and STEM probe, to create the powerful and global pioneer ESTEM (Environmental Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope) with full STEM imaging and analysis. It has been created in-house at modest cost, by the approach and since the core instrument and specialised site capital investments were already in place, and it operates under controlled working catalyst conditions of high temperature and continuously flowing gas sample environment [3, 4]. 
 Technically the most noteworthy recent development in the field has been the introduction by the authors of this proposal using the new tool for the first reliable detection of the seemingly general continuing presence of single atoms and small clusters on a support between larger nanoparticles in a typical heterogeneous solid state gas reaction catalyst. To date this is best demonstrated by the important, as well as more generally illustrative, Pt-C system [4], and in quantitative exploitation of the method for Cu [7]. Ground breaking quantitative dynamic atom-by-atom analysis for Pt particle coarsening in hydrogenation reactions is being developed. These results, enabled by the novel York ESTEM instrument developments, are the first reliable single atom sensitive STEM or TEM data under representative operating conditions of a continuous gas atmosphere and controlled high temperature. The new results will be used to inform key catalyst activation, operating and deactivation mechanisms at a new level of atom-by-atom analysis of the direct causes influencing Ostwald Ripening deactivation by atom migration between fixed particle centres. They will extend the prior art TEM studies which have been on a much longer (nm) scale of the coarsening consequences for nanoparticle size growth. The new results will be used to guide how processes might be better controlled and bad outcomes moderated. The impact is potentially worth &amp;pound;Bns in monetary and environmental value. It derives from new insights into the creation of novel strategies which might be used to restrain, or control, key negative impact process variables. The results complement and extend STM work [17], which is generally on ideal substrates with a very restricted range of (small) particle sizes and forms, and replaces much less reliable attempts to use ETEM [18] or high vacuum STEM. As pointed out by the authors [11], even reliable detection, and much less measurement, of &amp;lt;2nm size particles (which are most of the mechanistically important ones) on a support, can be difficult to even detect with the usual bright field EM methods, but the sensitivity of high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM imaging available in the ESTEM has been extended down to the single atom level under a sub-set of realistic catalyst operating conditions [4]; noting there is no real TEM equivalent of high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM.
 Working with industrial partner Johnson Matthey Plc we have previously shown [11] that in extended (47,000 mile) real world use on the road, and mirrored in in-situ experiments, the mean size of Pt/Pd particles in a diesel oxidation exhaust emission catalyst (DOC) on an alumina-based support increased from 2.5 to 11(&amp;plusmn;0.2)nm with a corresponding large reduction in surface area available for reaction. There were also changes in structural character with higher and less reactive Pt-Pt surface co-ordination; and Pd surface enrichment in the Pt/Pd system [11]. This is revealed with precision EDX analysis introduced to the ETEM/ESTEM world with the York development. Over time, catalyst efficacy may be reduced by an order of magnitude or more; or to &amp;lt;10% of the starting state. There is of course in this a massive impact opportunity technically, economically and in the environmental consequences of potentially needing to use much less rare Pt if the new learnings could be used to maintain more nanoparticle surface area, and thereby application catalyst efficiency; either directly or in new opportunities made possible if deactivation processes can at least be made slower; and ideally of course stabilised completely.
 The newly discovered 'intermediate' species of disordered rafts and clusters down to the single atom level may have different and in some cases more useful reactivity to similar atoms bound on to more established (1-2nm in size and up) fully developed 'bulk-like' crystalline nanoparticles [3,7]. 
 The isolated atoms and surface excrescences, or similar residuals, may be a small fraction of the whole, but they can be expected to have a disproportionately strong effect by being continuously exposed to the gas environment [3, 8,10]. We will now be able to directly investigate the basis of single atom catalysis, for the first time under working conditions, likely leading to the discovery of new mechanisms, and from them we should get new and improved processes; and/or learn how to manage old ones better. Other labs around the world are at the highest resolution restricted to using either ETEM without a probe corrector, or much STEM (or EDX) capability at all, or to using a high vacuum STEM in which samples are exposed to different conditions in transfer and analysis and continuing in-situ methods are of unknown reliability in a reaction atypical high vacuum environment. The relatively new commercial MEMS holders, with gas containing windows [16a,b] are more limited in imaging and analytical performance. The mobile atoms, revealed for the first time in the ESTEM at York using a gas environment with a hot stage [3-6,12], have been shown [7] to modify the previously accepted version of the detailed model of Ostwald Ripening (OR) deactivation mechanism at lower operating temperatures [20,21]. This finding, if confirmed and extended to the single atom level, has profound implications for understanding, and eventually perhaps constructively controlling, or at least usefully influencing, the OR process on a new atomistic level. Just slowing it down even by small amounts would be extremely valuable in highly leveraged economic and environmental terms. 
 An additional important aspect of catalyst activation, referred to in the above, is the reduction of copper oxide Cu2O to Cu metal [15]. The highly reactive surface of copper nanoparticles is protected from the outside atmosphere by an oxide film and the catalyst is only prepared for action when the protective oxide layer is stripped off by treatment with H2 gas. We follow in the ESTEM a similar procedure to that used on a chemical plant, e.g. to prepare a methanation catalyst for action. 
 
The project goals have been focused on using disruptive existing experimental ESTEM tools at York, to gain new and transformative single atom level insights into the dynamic properties of nanostructures at the heart of heterogeneous catalyst performance, and in the emerging field of single atom and very small cluster catalysis. The results are contributing to a better focused scientific understanding of key solid state catalyst materials for gas reactions. The direct value of catalysts produced worldwide in 2015 is estimated [to be &amp;gt;&amp;pound;10B pa, with trillions of dollars of product outputs, and economic and environmental opportunities to improve outcomes with wide societal benefits [Re: Royal Society of Chemistry Catalysis estimates, 2010)].

The science the our ESTEM is opening up open up is exciting. AC ESTEM provides a key tool for the study of single atoms in catalysts under reaction conditions with the ability to analyse the structure of the nanoparticles. This is a novel and very important development in terms of impact. As well as new information on the migration of materials from one discrete, in this case metal, nanoparticle to another; it shows the importance of these species leading to active sites. This work relates to parallel on-going Monte Carlo (MC) calculations and provides important input for further calculations of functionality and specific chemical reactivity; through for example the density functional theory (DFT) methods we used for catalytic nanoparticles (at that time studied with temperature and without gas) in our 2012 Nanoletters paper (vol. 12, p.2027 [13]).

With the award of the EPSRC grant we have developed the world's first full function high performance aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). It has &amp;lt;0.1nm resolution capability and single atom sensitivity for dynamic in-situ experiments on solid state heterogeneous catalysts for gas reaction studies and we are now moving into the application intensive phase of the project. 
Our development has created in the UK a novel and globally leading research capability providing Angstrom Analysis for dynamic in-situ reaction studies under controlled conditions of temperature and continuous gas atmosphere; rather than the usual high vacuum or pulsed gas. 
We have modified an existing AC TEM/STEM instrument to complement and extend its capabilities with gas reaction studies while maintaining, and in some aspects extending, vacuum especially, the full performance and functionality of the core tool. Our new design provides the world's first full function aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). The global competition (approx. 20 labs, all overseas - Europe, USA, Japan) continues to use a version of our earlier ETEM design which is in practice high resolution in TEM only and come with a single aberration corrector for TEM imaging. The old design has significant analytical and imaging limitations which make it unsuitable for multi-user environments; to the extent several laboratories have a dedicated machine (as we did with the original) and second instrument for other uses. This is expensive in both capital and operating costs as well as in real estate and support needs. With the modifications to the machine at York, ETEM is also (re-) introduced into the UK in high resolution form. Perhaps more significantly, cost-wise, the full ESTEM functionality also supports full STEM for the parallel high vacuum operations. This in itself is major advantage of the new developments which not only enable the new functionalities but also support a much wider and more intensive utilisation of the core capital kit investment in multi-use applications, as well as ensuring the substantially fixed support coats are spread over as wide a range of applications as possible.
In association with partners in the vibrant UK chemical and energy industries we are generating fundamental application science underpinning nanoparticle based solid state heterogeneous catalysis used in gas-solid reactions. Our primary industry partners are Johnson Matthey Plc.
With the award of the grant in 2012 we began construction of modifications beyond the very limited initial proof-of-principle demonstrations for gas operations on the multi-use high resolution microscope in our laboratory at York. This included a complete rebuild of the column pumping systems and replacement of the supplied pipework with new designed for purpose stainless steel pipework and fittings to full UHV standards of cleanliness. As planned, this proved to be an economical route to go; in part due to the standardisation of parts in a competitive market and because the UK retains an industry able quickly to make special pipework, also at modest cost.

The year 2013 saw the launch of our aberration corrected ESTEM as a scientifically useful capability. Further improvements to the new core capability and to support other uses of the capital kit with a minimum of compromises and crucially without the need to change the machine configuration for different applications, are continuing. For example there is a simple and rapid switch over from gas-mode to high vacuum mode with no changes to the hardware involved. For the first time we have designed and built a machine in which the gas introduction, pumping and control systems do not interfere with the conventional high vacuum performance and in some respect improve on it. 

Phase one technical developments on the microscope have been successfully completed and they have produced a first high profile application publication in Annalen der Physik in June 2013. With the developments we have made we have created at minimal expense world leading new ESTEM functionality without compromising other attributes for these and other applications on the existing high vacuum multi-user machine. 

Recent progress with the new generation of MEMS hot stages we have been able to purchase with the grant (substituting for part of the originally proposed old technology), has been transformational in what we can do scientifically, in productivity and with most of the technical support by ourselves on site rather than regular sagas of return- to-foreign-factory for service. This development makes it practical to track areas continuously over time and during temperature transits, with especial relevance to comparison data for the MC calculations; themselves not part of the project but augmenting it through studentships.

The science the new capabilities open up is exciting. It provides a key tool for the study of single atoms in catalysts under reaction conditions in a machine also able to analyse the structure of the nanoparticles. This is a novel and potentially very important development in terms of impact. As well as new information on the migration of materials from one discrete, in this case metal, nanoparticle to another; it shows the potential importance of these species as active sites themselves; out there on the support surface. This work relates to parallel on-going Monte Carlo calculations and provides important input for further calculations of functionality and specific chemical reactivity; through for example the DFT methods we used for catalytic nanoparticles (at that time studied without gas) in a 2012 Nanoletters paper.

In 2014 further technical developments on the microscope have increased the gas pressures inside the microscope (as outlined in our EPSRC grant proposal) and resulted in high profile publications in the first quarter of 2014, including in Comptes Rendu (Physique). This is also the time for ramping up the PDRA supported applications of the new kit developments. 3x PDRAs have now been appointed; all of them experienced electron microscopists with application domain science backgrounds in nanoparticle physics and chemistry for cstalysis. In this we have been most fortunate.

Support for continuing as associate partner of EPSRC SuperSTEM at Daresbury, as the in-situ component of the EPSRC National facility for aberration corrected electron microscopy. Project work with Leeds and Sheffield on this. 

There has been significant industrial collaboration leading to joint publications with Johnson Matthey Plc, a FTSE 100 company and world leader in precious metals and catalysis. JM was also a strong supporter of our grant proposal and the interaction continues to be further strengthened at the strategic and tactical levels. 
The latter include CASE studentships, access to their extensive technical resources for both specimen preparation (including custom preparation to our specifications where needed) and testing, and regular direct technical work for which they pay the University.
