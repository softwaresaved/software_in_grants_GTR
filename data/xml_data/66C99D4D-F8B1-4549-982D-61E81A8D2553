reference</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J01950X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>RefNet proposes an EPSRC research network advancing the interdisciplinary study of reference by linking communities that have so far tended to work in near isolation from each other. 

Reference is the process of making sure that a user/receiver can identify an entity - for example a person, thing, place, or event. Reference can be accomplished through language, but also through for example pointing, gaze, highlighting, and combinatons of the above. Reference can be considered the &amp;quot;anchor&amp;quot; of communication, and as such it is crucial for practical applications, from robotics and gaming to embodied agents, satellite navigation, and multimodal interfaces. 

RefNet will foster collaboration between researchers in Computing Science and researchers in Psycholinguistics, and between researchers and practitioners in industry and the public sector. Through the study of reference, RefNet will build a wider interdisciplinary skills base for research on communication that will be of crucial importance at a time when computing science is becoming closely interlinked with other disciplines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main purpose of RefNet is to change the way in which research communities interact, and the way in which they are able to influence, and be influenced by, practical applications.

Reference is a key mechanism in communication, &amp;quot;anchoring&amp;quot; words to things, people, events, times, places, etc. Understanding reference is therefore an important aspect of human knowledge. RefNet will contribute significantly to this understanding, though its skill building activities (e.g. the Summer School, bursaries, lab visits), and through improved interactions between Computational Linguists and Psycholinguists. In many cases, understanding will take the form of precise quantitative models.

Reference plays a crucial role in many practical applications of computing science, such as multimodal interfaces, Geographic Information Systems, spoken dialogue, gaming, Satellite Navibation, and robotics. RefNet will help the design of these applications by offering the sophistication of computational psycholinguistics. Confidence in the potential for RefNet to succeed in this regard can be gathered from the support letters (attached) from AT&amp;amp;T, Nokia, and Data2Text. 

Reference also plays an important role in daily life, including situations where errors can be fatal, such as emergency medicine, where protocols for spatial reference (e.g., to explain where on a mountain the victim of a mountaineering accident lies) are still error prone. A better understanding of reference and direction giving could improve such protocols. If this were to happen, lives would be saved, for example because quick and accurate direction finding is often crucial (e.g. in rural areas).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56387</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Radboud University Nijmegen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:department>Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour</gtr:department><gtr:description>Flora van Langendock's participation in the 2013 Cognitive Science conference in Berlin</gtr:description><gtr:id>CC39CCAD-2DD5-4555-A45C-1FC63B078303</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Vanlangendonck, F., Willems, R.

These two topics have great relevance for reference (which is the main focus of the project). They were chosen as the themes of the Round Table event because they have much wider significance across the cognitive sciences, and because they are topical.

Additionally, we accepted a number of posters (following an open call) detailing recent research that sheds light on these themes; these posters were visible throughout the event and discussed during a special session. 

The event concluded with a 2.5-hour discussion about future cross-disciplinary research projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.matt.qa/refnet/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Summer School Psychological and Computational Models of Language Production</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>67A3749B-609B-4FCF-9CDF-5EF942193724</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Aim of the RefNet Summer School (Edinburgh, 25-30 Aug 2014): The modelling of human language production requires an increasingly varied range of skills &amp;amp; techniques, hailing from different scientific disciplines, including psychology, computing science, linguistics, and others. Examples of these skills are eye-tracking, algorithmic models, bayesian reasoning, and mixed-effects modelling. The summer school is an attempt to introduce and discuss these techniques, focussing on the production of referring expressions as an example. The summer school focusses on the linguistic phenomenon of reference production because it is one of the best examples of the convergence of the above-mentioned disciplines.



The Summer school contained 5 courses (Algorithms; Eye-tracking; Statistical techniques; Linguistic theory of reference; the acquisition of reference), which will be delivered sequentially to allow each participant to take part in every course. 5 invited speakers have agreed to give evening lectures. One month after the start of registration, more than 70 people have applied to take part in the summer school; 55 were admitted.

The most important impact of this activity was that 55 young researchers were able to learn about the latest theories and techniques relevant for their work; these include algorithmic modelling, eye-tracking, mixed effect models, and so on. They were also given ample opportunity to learn directly from each other and from the 15 lecturers involved in the summer school. And yes, plans were made for &amp;quot;future related activity&amp;quot; (the most appropriate of the options offered by the menu below).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.vdeemter/pages/RefNet/events.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RefNet Workshop on Psychological and Computational Models of Reference Comprehension and Production</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5507AA05-F8DD-4DE6-9C72-302E5F355A55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This RefNet Workshop, which took place 31 Aug 2014 in Edinburgh, has brought together current developments in the study of production and comprehension of referring expressions in different scientific disciplines such as psychology, computer science and linguistics.

After the workshop, interest in RefNet has grown considerably. THis is especially clear from the requests for funding for lab visits that we have received in recent weeks.

The general quality of the papers presented was high. Two developments were of particular interest:
1. Contributions that apply Bayesian methods to reference production for the first time
2. In-depth discussions concerning the appropriateness of the experiments that were done.
