communication skills for learning by all children. Although the developmental pathways of typically developing children and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder differ in many respects, both groups may find social interactions stressful and intimidating, and this can impact negatively on their communication abilities and learning.&amp;nbsp; ECHOES II aims to address these issues by creating a safe, motivating, and inclusive echnology-enhanced learning environment allowing children to explore and improve their basic social interaction skills.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>ECHOES II aims to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Develop a set of learning activities capable of supporting children with different developmental trajectories in improving their abilities in social interactions. 
&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>Develop a participatory, learner-centered, design approach to ensure that children, and their parents and carers, are given a voice in the technology design process. 
&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>Implement a technology-enhanced learning environment capable of scaffolding children's exploration and learning of social interaction skills at different levels of social engagement. 
&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>Develop a comprehensive framework for assessing the effectiveness of the learning activities and tools created during the project&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>ECHOES II will employ an iterative participatory design and modular implementation methodology&amp;nbsp; for both the learning experience and the technology able to support it.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>895904</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Produced by Xube and commissioned by Becta this video showcases the TLRP-TEL Echoes project led by Kaska Porayska-Pomsta at the London Knowledge Lab.

This is reflected in the number of publications, both journal and conference, which have been produced to date, with a number of journal publications still being either under review or have been just accepted for publication. The project attracts multi-disciplinary interest with both social scientists and computer scientists being equally keen to understand and reuse the ECHOES technologies and approaches. 

We have had interest from industrial companies, two of which have been actively involved in the follow-on SHARE-IT project (EP/K012428/1) and have donated an equivalent of &amp;pound;50K in equipment and labour to date.

Another important impact outcome is a lasting and growing collaboration with schools and their enthusiasm for the ECHOES technology and the research process. This is evidenced in their continuing involvement in the follow-on projects, including the Shape (ES/J011207/1) and the SHARE-IT projects.

International collaborations are flourishing as a direct consequence of the project and its success. The PI of ECHOES has been invited to participate in a EU-FP7 project (called TARDIS) which builds on methods for both designing and evaluating intelligent learning environment for supporting the development of social communication. International students are increasingly attracted to the partner institutions. One of the notable collaborations is the one between the ECHOES PI and IIIT-Hyderbad, which has led directly to the EPSRC funded SHARE-IT project and TESSA (Institute of Education funded knowledge transfer project) with further funded collaborations being planned in the foresable future.

Two high profile projects have been funded independently by the ESRC and EPSRC since the end of the ECHOES project to the combined value of &amp;pound;370K (fEC), demonstrating that both councils and the reviewers of the proposals regard the ECHOES project as a solid basis for further social scientific and computer science research. Further funding has been granted to utilise the SHARE-IT platform, which has been inspired substantially by ECHOES, in delivering neuroscientific intervention in ninety schools in the UK (the unLOCKE project, funded jointly by the Wellcome Trust and the Educational Endowment Foundation).

We now have four schools keenly involved in the follow-on research and a commitment from the teachers and headteachers to continue this involvement indefinitely. The schools are investing their own money and time to be involved in the research led by us and are putting in place practices which reflect the lessons learned during the ECHOES project as well as advanced technologies including ECHOES and its new incarnation developed through SHARE-IT.

The academic impact has been achieved chiefly through publishing the results of the ECHOES research as well as through invited talks and high profile events such as the Royal Society Event and the Festival of Social Science. Both events attracted media attention, including Sky News, BBC online, Polish National Television, Deutsche Welle Radio as well as ESRC inhouse publications and Press Releases, including the Impact video about ECHOES.

Our continuing collaboration and dialogue with schools is the chief reason for the non-academic impact. We believe that the continuity of engagement is key to developing trust between teachers, parents and children and we have continued our work with all stakeholders even when funding was not available.

Researchers who worked on the ECHOES project have benefited a great deal in terms of the interdisciplinary methods and practices that they learned throughout the project. This knowledge is now imparted on the new generation of TEL researchers at PhD and masters levels at all partner institutions, with many a master project focusing on ECHOES - either its possible redesigns, further participatory design methods applications and data analysis. Internships and research visits by international researchers are common and they lead to further dissemination of the project as well as new collaborations, new perspectives and new opportunities for impact.

Industrial companies are now involved in furthering the real-world robustness of the technology prototypes during ECHOES.

Many teachers have changed their attitude towards technology and their understanding of what technology is and can do. The main impact in this respect was a shift in a number of teachers' interpretations of their role in the design process and their realisation that instead of being merely consumers of technologies designed by others, they can be co-creators and curators of technology. This shift in attitude has lead directly to the definition of the objectives for both of the follow-on projects funded.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F283A801-D987-4EB5-9906-25FEC2FC7BA5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>ECHOES II is a technology-enhanced learning (TEL) environment for 5 to 7 years old children to explore and practice skills needed for successful social interaction, such as sharing of attention with others, turn-taking, initiating and responding to bids for interaction. ECHOES supports typically developing children (TD) and children with autism spectrum disorders (ASCs). As well as being a tool for learning by children, ECHOES is a research tool for exploring the specific difficulties of individual children in relation to social interaction.

The project employed participatory design methodology to allow the researchers to co-design the environment with children and teachers and to determine how it could be used in real classrooms. ECHOES also relied on the SCERTS intervention framework and utilised Artificial Intelligence techniques in order to record and interpret interaction data between children and the environment. This data coupled with the data obtained through the ECHOES' evaluation provides the basis for the project's findings and motivates further research.

ECHOES was evaluated in 4 UK schools, over eight weeks. 41 (TD and ASD) children participated. Quantitative analysis of social communication behaviours using a specially designed coding scheme revealed positive trends in improvement in responses to human partner initiations whilst using ECHOES. The improvement observed during ECHOES indicates the potential for TEL environments such as ECHOES to facilitate previously unobserved social communication skills in children with ASC and points the way to further modifications required at the technology engineering level that are needed to engender flexibility and extendability of TEL that fits diverse contexts of use.

The main findings of the project relate to: 
(1) efficacy and usefulness of technology enhanced environments in supporting social communication skills by children with ASC. Quantitative analysis of social communication behaviours using a specially designed coding scheme revealed positive trends in improvement in responses to human partner initiations whilst using ECHOES. The improvement observed during ECHOES indicates the potential for TEL environments such as ECHOES to facilitate previously unobserved social communication skills in children with ASC (Bernardini, Porayska-Pomsta, Smith and Avramides, 2012; Bernardini, Porayska-Pomsta and Smith, 2013; Porayska-Pomsta et al., submitted). Some children also showed an improved ability to self-regulate emotionally, especially in the context of the ECHOES task-based activities (Alcorn et al., 2011), to turn-take and share attention with others (Menzies, 2012). Observing such behaviours allowed teachers to appreciate the child's hidden potential and to tailor the support accordingly, thus having instantaneous impact on the specific intervention and practice for the particular children. Observing the individual children to behave more spontaneously and communicatively in the context of ECHOES than in the classroom was reported by the teachers as the key aspect of the ECHOES environment and the reason for their enthusiasm to see technologies such as ECHOES in their classrooms. 
(2) importance of technology-enhanced approaches, especially those that utilise Artificial Intelligence methods (user modelling and autonomous agents) both to support learning and research about learning. From the outset, ECHOES was set up to log and interpret the interaction data in real-time. The logging of data is used to capture low-level information (e.g. where the child is touching the screen at any given point; how long does the child takes to respond) and this log data is used to infer patterns of behaviour for each child, to (a) inform the system's design, especially the ability of the virtual character to interact with the child in real-time and (b) inform about each child's progress in minute detail, not feasible in normal classroom circumstances. In attempting to be adaptive based on real-time capture and interpretation of data, coupled with encouraging results and enthusiastic response by teachers, ECHOES provides an early and important step towards adaptive technologies for autism. The logged data also provides a precious resource for the generation of further hypotheses related to the individual children and children with ASC more generally, of relevance to psychologists, education experts and computer scientists (Bernardini, Porayska-Pomsta and Smith, 2013).
(3) participatory design (PD) methods involving young children with ASD and their carers in the design of the technologies for use by them. ECHOES invested in PD from the start and has successfully extended and tested the existing methods of involving young children with autism and their teachers in the design of technologies for use by them (Frauenberger, Good, and Keay-Bright, 2011), thereby contributing further to human-computer interaction research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the ECHOES II project have already been taken forward in a multitude of different follow-on projects, including the ESRC funded Shape project (ES/J011207/1) which aimed to explore the way ECHOES, amongst other three technology-enhanced learning environments for autism, fared in the context of real classrooms with minimal support from the researchers. The key to the Shape project was the need to move beyond the aspirational rhetoric of TEL for real classroom to investigating the pre-requisites of real-world uptake. 

The EPSRC funded SHARE-IT project (EP/K012428/1) also derived as a direct consequence of ECHOES II. One of the key practical findings of ECHOES related to the need to develop industry standard software as a means of fulfilling the ambition of TEL making it to the real-world. Another finding related to the need for the technology to be flexible and adaptable to the specific contexts and circumstances in which learning experiences are offered. Several children during ECHOES evaluation studies manifested behaviours which they did not in the class, highlighting the need for between-contexts intervention and support. Therefore, SHARE-IT's main efforts were dedicated to building, in partnership with parents, teachers and children, a robust technology, which could be also authored by the users (without substantial involvement of researchers) to suit the contexts in which they wanted to use the environment. 

The SHARE-IT project was fundamental to securing further funding in what is becoming a larger research programme related to TEL design, implementation and uptake. Specifically the TESSA project, a small, but important Institute of Education funded knowledge transfer project (&amp;pound;26K), relates to exploring inter-cultural viability of the SHARE-IT environment (and through it of many of the ECHOES original ideas) to other cultural contexts - in this case to the context of Indian education. The unLOCKE project, funded jointly by the Wellcome Trust and Educational Endowment Foundation (&amp;pound;1M) reflects a step-change in both the quality and general applicability of original ideas and findings of ECHOES and of extendability of the technology developed through SHARE-IT (its child project). unLOCKE aims to create a neuroscientific intervention for training primary school children's inhibition of intuitive reasoning in relation to counterintuitive concepts in mathematics and science
