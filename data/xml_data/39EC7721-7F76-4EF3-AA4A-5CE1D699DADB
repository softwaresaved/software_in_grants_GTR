There are seven of them in all, each with at least one (most with more than one) physiological action to regulate how cells function - and these actions take place in almost every conceivable location within a cell. When these processes are not appropriately regulated, pathologies can occur: polyphosphoinositol lipids are implicated in, for example, cancer, inflammation, neurological disorders and cardiovascular disease. The subject of this application is the most recently discovered polyphosphoinositol lipid, phosphatidylinositol 5-phophate (PI5P), which is present in many locations of the cell (including within the nucleus, one of the key foci of this project). PI5P has, by a large body of circumstantial evidence, been implicated in the way in which cells respond to stress (uv light, heat, oxidizing radicals), responses which self-evidently must act as part of their defense against environmentally-induced disease. The levels of PI5P (and thus its functions, because its actions are regulated primarily by how much is present at a given location) are regulated by a family of three enzymes, which are the focus of this study: the PI5P 4-kinases (PI5P5Ks). We have found that our (mammalian) PI5P4Ks are present at different amounts in different tissues, and at very different locations within a cell. Moreover, they have remarkably different enzymic activities (PI5P4K alpha being by far the most active), and our most recent discovery is that, unexpectedly, they associate with one another as pairs to generate a variety of mixtures (e.g. for alpha and beta: alpha/alpha, alpha/beta and beta/beta). As a result of this, we find that the very active PI5P4K alpha is 'targeted' to different places in the cell by association with the other PI5P4ks (specifically, the PI5P4K beta takes PI5P4K alpha into the nucleus, and probably PI5P4K gamma takes it to vesicles in the cytoplasm).
So far this is a static and rather functionless picture we have, and the main thrust of this project it to address that shortcoming. We plan to attach fluorescent 'tags' to the PI5P4Ks, and then use the absolute cutting edge of fluorescence imaging techniques to gain unprecedented insight into exactly where they go, how quickly they move from location to location, how they behave with respect to each other, and what this all means for the way in which cells react to stress. The cellular model that we plan to use for most of these studies is the genetically very powerful DT40 cell line, but these cells are of chicken origin and do not have a gene for PI5P4K gamma (though that is helpful in that it makes studying alpha and beta easier!), so we also plan to use a human cell line which is currently emerging as a model cell line equally powerful to DT40s, Nalm-6 cells, to explore PI5P4K gamma in similar fashion. Finally, scientists in Edinburgh have generated a mouse lacking the PI5P4K gamma gene, and because PI5P4K gamma is found at exceptionally high levels in specific parts of the kidney tubular system we will contribute to a collaboration with our colleagues in Edinburgh to study the kidney physiology of these mice in great detail.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinases (PI5P4Ks) are enigmatic inositol lipid kinases whose function is currently believed to be to regulate the cellular levels of their substrate, PI5P, an inositol lipid found at low levels in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of animal cells, and whose function has so far been associated with stress-activated signalling pathways. We have, primarily by the novel tehnique of genomic tagging in DT40 cells, made a series of discoveries about the three mammalian isoform, PI5P4Ks alpha, beta and gamma that throw a new light on their functional interrelationship. The isoforms form stable heterodimers in vivo randomly (that is, the three isoforms will dimerise in proportion to their relative concentrations). Moreover, we have discovered that they have very different ezymatic activities, with alpha being much more active than beta, which is in turn much more active than gamma. Given that these isoforms each have distinct intracellular locations, our current hypothesis is that cells express different quantities of the three PI5P4Ks to target the active alpha to different locations: to cytoplasmic membranes (alpha/alpha), to the nucleus (alpha/beta) or trafficking vesicles (alpha/gamma).
This project aims firstly, to explore the dynamics and functions of the interrelationship between genomically tagged PI5P4Ks alpha and beta in DT40 cells, principally by using a wide gamut of cutting edge fluorescent technologies including FCS, FCCS, Raster image CS and Time-resolved Anisotropy. These, together with electron microscopy, degron-tagging and chemical biology will not only provide unprecedented insight into how this relationship works and functions in vivo, but throw more general light on the mechanisms of isoform-targeted localisation as a general evolutionary strategy for localising cell signalling pathways. To extend the study to the third isoform, PI5P4K gamma, which DT40 cells lack, we will use a close human equivalent, Nalm-6 cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>(a) The impact of this application is largely scientific, in that it seeks to make important contributions to our basic understanding of how cellular stress pathways operate. Inositol lipids have a wide range of crucial physiological functions, and although PI5P4Ks are generally thought to be involved in cellular stress signalling, this is not certain, and any attempt to try to clarify what they do should be to the benefit of our wider understanding of human pathologies. Also, as outlined in the 'beneficiaries' section above, our study has a much wider generic value in increasing our understanding of how endogenous protein-protein interactions actually operate in vivo to control localisation and function. 

(b) There is a potential societal impact in that if the PI5P4K gamma aspect (see above in 'beneficiaries') does lead directly to insights into kidney physiology, then given the likelihood that it is kidney stress responses to which PI5P4K gamma would contribute, there is a small but significant chance that a rapid transfer of information to improving stressed kidney physiological responses could ensue.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>349338</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/59EE0EA2-7E21-421F-A1CD-147D5700C6C0"><gtr:id>59EE0EA2-7E21-421F-A1CD-147D5700C6C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>In B cells, phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase-a synthesizes PI(4,5)P2 to impact mTORC2 and Akt signaling.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f24405a6d8b27d5691232d7921709ed0"><gtr:id>f24405a6d8b27d5691232d7921709ed0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bulley SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/63702D47-AF69-4D7B-9B0C-704CAB2E36DF"><gtr:id>63702D47-AF69-4D7B-9B0C-704CAB2E36DF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase function.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in biological regulation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f24405a6d8b27d5691232d7921709ed0"><gtr:id>f24405a6d8b27d5691232d7921709ed0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bulley SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2212-4926</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A07D2E59-7CFD-4C9E-85C4-4625E60CE7D5"><gtr:id>A07D2E59-7CFD-4C9E-85C4-4625E60CE7D5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase ?
