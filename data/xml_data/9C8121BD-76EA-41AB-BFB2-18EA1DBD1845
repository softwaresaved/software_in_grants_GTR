Roman invasions Caerau Iron-age hillfort was once the major power centre for the entire Cardiff region. In a sense, all roads would have lead to this important site which would have been a focal place where outlying communities would come together to express their identity and power through the construction of monumental earthworks. 

Today, however, Caerau and Ely are areas of significant social and economic deprivation and marginalisation, particularly for young people. High unemployment, poor educational opportunities and a range of social problems inhibit life chances and create a culture of aspirational poverty. There is also a significant and, to a large extent, exaggerated stigma associated with this area of Cardiff and its problems. For many young people today then, all roads seem to lead away from Caerau and Ely.

The HEART of Cardiff Project aims to directly address issues of marginalisation and aspirational poverty working in collaboration with community partner ACE (Action in Caerau and Ely) to significantly expand their existing All our Stories project and establish a circular heritage trail, researched and created by local residents and young people and punctuated by their heritage themed artwork and supported by a digital resource trail, which will connect local communities with St Fagans National History Museum and once again place Caerau and Ely and their amazing histories at the heart of West Cardiff.

Building on the recently funded HLF All our Stories Pathway to the Past Project at Caerau hillfort and dovetailing with the CAER Heritage Project phase 2 Digging Caerau excavations and reconstruction of an Iron Age village at St Fagans National History Museum, the HEART of Cardiff Project will engage local people of all ages in the design of the heritage trail and the creation of an accompanying digital resource, hosted by the People's Collection website, which will provide historical information and folk memories about important local sites way-marking the trail. Young people facing exclusion will then employ this design and the accompanying histories/stories and will physically create the heritage trail linking communities in Caerau, Ely and Fairwater with St Fagans. 

As they design and build this heritage trail, participants will work with a professional artist and early career academics to express their findings through heritage themed artwork, eco-graffiti and a digital resource. Developing the model of the Pathway to the Past All our Stories project with ACE, local people will also work closely with academic researchers, university students and heritage management experts to learn about and research the amazing multi-period heritage of the area. They will discover how they can preserve and enhance that heritage - strengthening bonds of community and acquiring new skills and confidence in the process. In conjunction with the Digging Caerau, HEART of Cardiff will thereby create a lasting legacy which will invest local young people in their heritage, providing them with a powerful sense of the importance of their 'home turf' and encouraging people from outside of Caerau and Ely to visit, rather than shun, this unique and vibrant area of Cardiff.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The HEART of Cardiff project will create a lasting legacy which will invest local people in their heritage, providing them with a powerful sense of the importance of their 'home turf' and encouraging people from outside of Caerau and Ely to visit, rather than shun, this unique and vibrant area of Cardiff. A range of informal and formal educational activities providing skills and challenging aspirational poverty will be delivered and developed through the process of co-produced research on the Digging Caerau project which will dovetail with HEART of Cardiff. This research will inform both academic and heritage interpretations of the site expressed through educational progression, heritage themed creative art and a legacy of heritage infrastructure. This will be supported by a community driven 'viral' campaign to promote the heritage and communities of Caerau and Ely co-ordinated by artist Paul Evans and the Early Career contributors.

Through a heritage themed art trail and accompanying digital resource HEART of Cardiff will thereby create a sustainable heritage resource which will be of benefit to the community; attracting external visitors and stimulating positive interest in Caerau, while also encouraging local residents to physically explore their heritage and utilise the significant resources provided by the National History Museum. In conjunction with the Digging Caerau project, it will thereby establish a firm link between the Iron-Age archaeology at the heart of the community and the reconstructed Iron-Age village, informed by research on that archaeology and co-produced by the community, at the St Fagans National History Museum just over a mile away. Moreover, community members will be active participants, contributors and beneficiaries at all stages in this project.

They also worked on scripts for their characters. These characters were then scanned into iPads and imported into a user-friendly app that allowed them to create short, scripted animation sequences. iPad photographs of Somerset House were used as backgrounds or scenery for these sequences. In all over 15 animation sequences were created over the duration of the festival.

An on-site animation workshop followed with participants involved in the process of working with the heads to create lip-synched animations. The heads were then photographed and digitised for studio development into a professional quality animation. Local resident and filmmaker, Viv Thomas, undertook audio and filmed interviews over the course of the excavation inviting local participants to express their feelings and experiences about the Caerau site including their involvement in archaeological research and discovery. Broader stories about the area's heritage were collected from local residents of all ages through community group networks. Both of these processes were facilitated by a local co-ordinator working with community development organisation Action in Caerau and Ely (ACE). The audio from these interviews was then used to further animate the modelled CAER-HEDZ into a 'talking heads' short studio animation film release in September 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8B7E9A5E-0741-4506-841B-643B51AB7EFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film showcased innovative and critically reflective research co-production perspectives and practices thereby enhancing the ongoing initiatives of CAER and reflecting the Connected Communities Programme core principles.

Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail. The mural was designed and developed by the young people during a series of intensive street-art workshops devised by Paul Evans, in close collaboration with St Fagan's Iron Age expert and artist Ian Daniel. To set the context, the young people visited the Iron Age reconstructed hillfort at Castell Henllys in West Wales. Here they engaged in two workshops devised by Paul. The first, a digital photography activity, was based on the micro-montages of street artist Slinkachu, and the other was a variation on eco-graffiti activities that Paul had used to effect during previous stages of the project. In this instance, the young people left their outlines on the side of the fort - a biodegradeable impression of their visit. 

Back at the youth centre, the young people engaged in two days of drawing workshops, generating letters and figures that Paul and Ian developed into finished designs for council approval. The young people were then given a choice of five designs based on their ideas and motifs - with Ian's design getting the vote. The mural design features two Iron Age Round houses, 'Ely beans' and graceful 'celto-graffiti' lettering spelling out the word Caerau (meaning 'hill-forts' in Welsh).

Photos and Iolo was a CAER Heritage Project exhibition format that was developed and co-produced by artist Paul Evans with pupils from Glyn Derw High School, National Museum Wales staff Loveday Williams, Owain Rhys and Ian Daniel, and CAER Heritage Project directors Dave Wyatt and Oliver Davis. Consisting of a series of re-usable pop-up banners Photos and Iolo was an interactive experience that encouraged viewers to get involved with the images on display by searching for the bard Iolo (or Ian Daniel, the Museum's Celtic demonstrator) - photo-shopped into images of Caerau and Ely that were taken by local residents. Once the participants have found Iolo then they are encouraged to take part in a riddle competition. These Riddles were created by pupils from Glyn Derw High School. The images featured came from a Barnardos project which took place in Ely and Caerau in the 1980s. Visitors who successfully solved the riddles were rewarded with an exhibition photo-booklet.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9AE1E14D-DDB3-4736-988F-8898B95E8B5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The co-creation of riddles with Glyn Derw High facilitated working with a class of English pupils and their teacher for the first time at the school. The exhibition at St Fagans was attended by around 60 visitors - engaging museum visitors with Connected Communities co-produced heritage research and highlighting local skills and showcasing community heritage assets. The exhibition was then subsequently transferred to the Caerau excavation site and exhibited during the Big Lunch open day in July 2014 to around 100 visitors, mostly local residents. Indeed, the pop-up banners and accompanying booklets make the exhibition portable and recyclable, allowing for it to be displayed and reused at other locations and events, for example it will go on display again during the CAER Project's Christmas 2014 event.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Photos and Iolo Exhibition</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://caerheritageproject.com/caer-blog/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Model Village project transformed participants into both historical and archaeological co-researchers and also into co-producers and co-directors of a remarkable animated film that explores the value of community heritage assets through a temporal perspective of past, present and future.

The challenge behind the workshops was to create transitory, witty works of art that reflected something of the heritage of the trail - creating ephemeral artworks and in situ images to populate our heritage trail resources. At Glyn Derw High we researched Roman motifs and made a series of thumb-nail sketches. We then braved the icy winds blowing over Trelai fields to create an army of buried legionaries emerging from the site of the Roman Villa on the Romans to Races trail. The young artists then made 3D graffiti models and placed these along the trail photographing them as they went. 

A similar workshop was also undertaken with the pupils at Michaelston Community College, this time themed on the medieval heritage of the location including St Michael's church. We decided that the door of the church would make an excellent 'portal' into the past - so we made one using interwoven twigs and branches. As at Glyn Derw, during the next stage of the workshop the young people made individual ephemeral artworks using modelling clay - again from the preliminary sketches based on Medieval motifs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>82F55BD6-627F-4806-8441-271158390291</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The, tried and tested, combination of archaeological and historically themed art and direct physical engagement with local sites proved an effective means of investing and engaging a new group of young people in their local heritage whilst inculcating a range of creative and interpersonal skills.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Heritage Trail Temporary Art Interventions</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://caerheritageproject.com/caer-blog/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>TV production company Greenbay produced a 4 hour TV series for S4C exploring origins in Wales employing DNA analysis.

15 pupils from Y8 - Y10 of Woodland High School and 15 pupils from Y8 from neighbouring Glyn Derw High School/Michaelston Community College (once two separate schools but recently federated) worked with professional artist Paul Evans and Cardiff University CAER Heritage Project to co-produce designs for a series of Iron Age 'playable artworks': themed sports equipment including 'Ping Pong Portals to the Past' or 'Iron Age Street Art' outdoor table tennis tables, decorated table tennis balls, and football kit. After the conclusion of the project the table tennis tables have been permanently sited outside The Michaelston Community College learning centre Ely and Woodlands High school.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2D44769F-6713-4882-9608-3A6A17919B4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Romanobritish' brought together two local schools, thus strengthening community bonds, challenging stereotypes, improving life choices, developing confidence, partnerships and social networks. The project and its output were also a unique, creative means of bringing the inspiration for this project - the Iron Age heritage of Caerau and Ely to life and, quite literally, into play. Caerau and Ely are host to an extraordinary physical heritage: one of the largest hill forts in South Wales and a Roman villa buried beneath the school playing fields - two sites that local school children have had hands on roles in investigating through the CAER Heritage Project. What made this project so distinctive is not only this amazing heritage, but also its foundation on mutually supportive creative play. This fed directly into 'playable' artworks: doorways to engagement with heritage, and stimuli for future curiosity/discussion way beyond the timescale of the project.
The project offered participating young people a structured framework of creative workshops and university quality accessible visual/historical references and acted as a pilot project based around collaborative participation from a special needs and mainstream school. A series of intensive creative workshops with a professional artist and an academic were delivered in these community schools. Qualitative outecomes included valuing artistic ability of young people with learning disabilities within the creative process, inculcating pride in place, development of grass roots relationships, aiding transition at a time of upheaval for Glyn Derw High pupils (the school was at that time being merged and effectively closed down). Challenging stigmas between mainstream and special needs secondary education, expanding social networks and providing new life opportunities by working with creative and academic professionals, raising aspirations and breaking down barriers to higher education, valuing community assets - in particular local heritage.

These intensive creative workshops focussed on 'Medieval Michaelston' and the 'Romans to the Races' trails. After a brief introduction by Dave, the young people made a series of quick thumbnail sketches. The young people then selected their favourite sketch and were given guidance on how to convert this design into a simple motif, suitable for stencilling. The CAER team also delivered a way mark logo co-creation workshop with the Friends of Caerau Hillfort group as part of a CAER project Christmas celebration event. Around 15 local residents attended this event with Paul Evans facilitating a workshop to design a striking way mark logo for the Celtic Caerau trail through a collective game of 'Pictionary.' We later returned to GAT in March 2014 and co-designed a way mark logo for the Plymouth Woodland Walk employing the same co-creation strategy.

With the way mark logos complete the designs have been employed to create a series of plastic stencils that have been laser cut with the assistance of teachers at Michaelston Community College. Over April 2014 the community groups and school pupils involved in creating the way mark logos have walked each of their respective trails employing the stencils to make impermanent (chalk, scrubbing surfaces, grass cutting) and permanent marks (spray paint) at key points on the trails to mark the way.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1803B1E0-9EAD-47C8-8E1B-EFD01D20704C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The way mark logo designs interface with a published trail leaflet and online HEART of Cardiff trail web resource for the trails which features artwork and other contributions of memories and knowledge from participating schools and community members.

Through the exhibition, Cardiff residents and visitors to the city experience the positive, vibrant history of Ely and Caerau, thus tackling ill-founded stereotypes and the external stigmas about the area. 
This project worked with elderly residents, valuing their knowledge and expertise, developing social networks, addressing isolation and nurturing intergenerational contact with young people. 30 year 9 school pupils gained opportunities for educational development and new skills including communication, team building, numeracy and literacy. 20 people were interviewed by the children for the exhibition and mural. 
As the school involved has a low take-up to University, breaking down barriers to HE was a significant objective, with pupils working alongside academics and postgraduates. One sixth-former who participated is now considering studying history at university. 
A further 60 people contributed to the project, by sharing memories at a range of local events in collaboration with community development partner ACE (Action in Caerau and Ely). Participants got a greater understanding not only of their WW1 heritage, but of the houses and streets in which they live. 
The project reinforced the University's commitment to the co-production of knowledge with local communities. It facilitated strong partnerships with local community groups and non-HE partners. Follow on projects are now planned to explore local place names and the project has also informed aspects of a recently secured large Heritage Lottery Grant to explore the area's rich archaeology and heritage. 
One of the schoolchildren involved said: &amp;quot; it was interesting to see what happened and what Ely was like back thenit was a fun experience, especially at the Glamorgan Archives and interviewing people who have lived in Ely for many yearsI loved hearing older people's stories about what they experienced in the past and seeing how different it was to my own life in Ely now.&amp;quot;
One of the hardest to reach pupils - who was at risk of exclusion from school - said in his feedback that the project had helped him understand how important school is, helped his learning in school, helped improve his confidence and social skills and that he learnt new skills on the trip. After a visit to the Glamorgan Archives, in his words, he said 'It was sick. I want to go here again.' He has since undertaken work experience at the Archives.

Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail. The mural was designed and developed by the young people during a series of intensive street-art workshops devised by Paul Evans, in close collaboration with St Fagan's Iron Age expert and artist Ian Daniel. To set the context, the young people visited the Iron Age reconstructed hillfort at Castell Henllys in West Wales. Here they engaged in two workshops devised by Paul. The first, a digital photography activity, was based on the micro-montages of street artist Slinkachu, and the other was a variation on eco-graffiti activities that Paul had used to effect during previous stages of the project. In this instance, the young people left their outlines on the side of the fort - a biodegradeable impression of their visit. 

Back at the youth centre, the young people engaged in two days of drawing workshops, generating letters and figures that Paul and Ian developed into finished designs for council approval. The young people were then given a choice of five designs based on their ideas and motifs - with Ian's design getting the vote. The mural design features two Iron Age Round houses, 'Ely beans' and graceful 'celto-graffiti' lettering spelling out the word Caerau (meaning 'hill-forts' in Welsh).

CHURCHYARD Detectives Project (November 2012)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history/archaeology project which focussed on the modern historical context of the Caerau locality. Pupils were initially involved in fieldwork noting inscriptions from graves in St Mary's Church on Caerau Hillfort. Following this they undertook research with historians and archivists at the Glamorgan Archives, reconstructing the lives of those buried there in the 19th and early 20th centuries. From this research they produced project work and performative presentations which were delivered at the Cardiff Story event in February 2013. This project was embedded in Glyn Derw's Literacy and Numeracy curriculum for that class, a first for the CAER Project. The strategy of embedding co-produced research within the secondary school curriculum has subsequently been employed successfully within other CAER project activities; it has proved very effective in terms of cementing a close partnership with participating schools, enhancing project development and outputs and breaking down barriers to HE.

Outputs from both of the community workshops were also subsequently displayed at the CAER Heritage Project/HEART of Cardiff Roadshow at the Ely Festival on 13th July 2013. Central to our presentation was another large map with the speculative HEART of Cardiff Heritage Trail route marked out in pins and coloured thread. Our first suggestion for the route was soon altered on the basis of local knowledge from a wide range of festival-goers. It was here that we were definitively advised that it might be best to break up the heritage trail into manageable circular sections around a central orbit. Members of healthy wealthy and wise then later took part in pilot walks of the Medieval Michaelston and Plymouth Wood trail orbits adding further local knowledge to the resources. They also helped to launch the trails and walked them with visitors to the HEART of Cardiff trail launch event. The trails interface with a published trail leaflet and online HEART of Cardiff trail web resource for the trails which features artwork and other contributions of memories and knowledge from participating schools and community members from this group.

Pathway to the Past Mural, March 2013 (see CAER blog entries March 2013)
Pathway to the Past was a CAER spin-off project funded by an All Our Stories HLF grant in collaboration with our community partners Action Caerau &amp;amp; Ely (ACE) - working with staff from the National History Museum, North Ely Youth and Community Centre and 10 local young people (aged between 14-16) experiencing exclusion from school. Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail.

Celtic Village Excavation 
Digging Caerau 2013 started with a training excavation for local people at St Fagans National History Museum in May 2013. Recent redevelopment of the museum meant that the museum's 'Celtic Village' (made up of 3 reconstructed Iron Age roundhouses) was demolished. This provided an opportunity for local people to learn basic excavation skills on a 'replica' Iron Age site before encountering the real thing as part of an accredited adult learner's course.

Photos and Iolo Exhibition, July 2014 (as part of Connected Communities Festival)
Photos and Iolo was a CAER Heritage Project exhibition format that was developed and co-produced by artist Paul Evans with pupils from Glyn Derw High School, National Museum Wales staff Loveday Williams, Owain Rhys and Ian Daniel, and CAER Heritage Project directors Dave Wyatt and Oliver Davis. Consisting of a series of re-usable pop-up banners Photos and Iolo was an interactive experience that encouraged viewers to get involved with the images on display by searching for the bard Iolo (or Ian Daniel, the Museum's Celtic demonstrator) - photo-shopped into images of Caerau and Ely that were taken by local residents. Once the participants have found Iolo then they are encouraged to take part in a riddle competition. These Riddles were created by pupils from Glyn Derw High School. The images featured came from a Barnardos project which took place in Ely and Caerau in the 1980s.

In March 2012, 90 pupils and 5 teachers from 3 participating secondary schools, Glyn Derw, Fitzalan and Mary Immaculate High were involved in a range of activities at the Caerau hillfort designed to interest and invest them in the site and conduct research. These activities included artefact analysis and Iron Age pottery workshops. Pupils participated directly in a geophysical survey of part of the site with an archaeological professional revealing the boundaries and houses of the ancient occupants of this place for the first time. Inspired by Iron Age artefacts they had seen at a field trip to the National History Museum, St Fagans, the pupils designed their own tribal symbols with professional artist, Paul Evans, and then scaled up these designs to land-art dimensions within the hillfort, using safe and biodegradeable tree bark. This activity proved very successful in both interesting and positively investing young people with the heritage of the site. The large eco-graffiti tribal logos subsequently gently biodegraded into the landscape and - significantly - were not disturbed by the groups of young people who regularly visit the site outside of school.
School participation in Timeteam excavation and Programme (April, 2012).
As a result of the above activities, Channel 4's Timeteam, with whom our School had been having negotiations, agreed to work in collaboration with the CAER project to undertake trial excavations and produce a programme about the hillfort. We negotiated for 10 local pupils (from three participating secondary schools) and 3 local residents from the community to both participate in the excavation and appear on the programme. The overall benefits of this media intervention, generally, outweighed any short-term negative impacts. Indeed, these benefits were significant in terms of both research, raising the profile of the site and highlighting talent within the local communities. Community participants and the communities of Caerau and Ely more broadly, featured in a very positive light in the subsequent programme (which was broadcast nationally in January 2013). Timeteam episode viewing figures frequently exceed 1.5m in the UK alone and the programme is also broadcast in a number of other countries, giving wide exposure to both the communities and this little known archaeological site. 
CAER Project Exhibition (June 2012-February 2013)
Following on from their involvement in geophysical survey, the creation of tribal logo artwork and Timeteam excavations 90 pupils from 3 participating secondary schools, produced displays of artwork, models, creative writing and historical perspectives on the Iron Age. Their coursework made up an exhibition which was displayed at St Fagans National History Museum in June 2012. The exhibition was opened by Mark Drakeford, Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services and Sian Price, series director of Timeteam. 
In January and February 2013 we took this exhibition on tour - first we were invited to the Welsh Government's Senedd building in Cardiff Bay by Mark Drakeford and then travelled onto the Cardiff Story Museum in central Cardiff later in February 2013. The then heritage minister, Huw Lewis, opened the exhibition at Cardiff Story and also launched Digging Caerau, with the exhibition remaining on display at the museum for 4 weeks. Participating pupils and teachers from the respective schools attended all of these exhibition launches and teacher feedback has highlighted the benefits in terms of pupil enskilment and confidence building. It is estimated that over 1,500 visitors viewed the exhibition across the three locations, once again significantly raising the profile of community talent and heritage assets in Caerau and Ely within the wider Cardiff context. 
CHURCHYARD Detectives Project (November 2012)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history/archaeology project which focussed on the modern historical context of the Caerau locality. Pupils were initially involved in fieldwork noting inscriptions from graves in St Mary's Church on Caerau Hillfort. Following this they undertook research with historians and archivists at the Glamorgan Archives, reconstructing the lives of those buried there in the 19th and early 20th centuries. From this research they produced project work and performative presentations which were delivered at the Cardiff Story event in February 2013. This project was embedded in Glyn Derw's Literacy and Numeracy curriculum for that class, a first for the CAER Project. The strategy of embedding co-produced research within the secondary school curriculum has subsequently been employed successfully within other CAER project activities; it has proved very effective in terms of cementing a close partnership with participating schools, enhancing project development and outputs and breaking down barriers to HE.
Poverty Detectives Project (March 2013)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history project which explored child poverty past and present with a focus on the lives of 19th century children in the Cardiff area. The pupils worked with academic historians, archivists at the Glamorgan Archives and CAER project artist Paul Evans to creatively express their findings through the creation of time-travelling conversations enacted by puppets created by the pupils. This project produced some inspiring outputs and was also embedded in the literacy and numeracy curriculum.
Digging Caerau Excavations (June-July 2013 and 2014) 
Glyn Derw High pupils and teachers were directly involved with the excavations with several classes undertaking archaeological fieldwork activities. More than 80 pupils, varying in age-group from Year 7 to Year 13 visited the site, over the two excavations, and worked in small groups with professional staff as supervisors. They were actively involved with various different on-site activities from excavation, sieving and finds processing, to more creative activities such as making Iron Age pots.
School co-production of way marks logos (December 2014 to March 2014)
In December 2013 Dave Wyatt and Paul Evans visited Michaelston College and Glyn Derw to brainstorm, design and develop the first two way-mark designs for the HEART of Cardiff trails. These intensive creative workshops focussed on 'Medieval Michaelston' and the 'Romans to the Races' trails. After a brief introduction, the young people made a series of quick thumbnail sketches. The young people then selected their favourite sketch and were given guidance on how to convert this design into a simple motif, suitable for stencilling.
Two follow on workshops were delivered to the same classes in each school in March 2014. The challenge behind the workshops was to create transitory, witty works of art that reflected something of the heritage of the trail - creating ephemeral artworks and in situ images to populate our heritage trail resources. At Glyn Derw High we researched Roman motifs and made a series of thumb-nail sketches. We then visited the heritage trail in Trelai fields to create an army of buried legionaries emerging from the site of the Roman Villa on the Romans to Races trail. The young artists then made 3D graffiti models and placed these along the trail photographing them as they went. 
A similar workshop was also undertaken with the pupils at Michaelston Community College, this time themed on the medieval heritage of the location including St Michael's church. We decided that the door of the church would make an excellent 'portal' into the past - so we made one using interwoven twigs and branches. As at Glyn Derw, during the next stage of the workshop the young people made individual ephemeral artworks using modelling clay - again from the preliminary sketches based on Medieval motifs. The, tried and tested, combination of archaeological and historically themed art and direct physical engagement with local sites proved an effective means of investing and engaging a new group of young people in their local heritage whilst inculcating a range of creative and interpersonal skills.
Way marking the Trails (April 2014)
With the way mark logos complete the designs have been employed to create a series of plastic stencils that have been laser cut with the assistance of teachers at Michaelston Community College. Over April 2014 the community groups and school pupils involved in creating the way mark logos have walked each of their respective trails employing the stencils to make impermanent (chalk, scrubbing surfaces, grass cutting) and permanent marks (spray paint) at key points on the trails to mark the way. 
These way marks interface with a published trail leaflet and online HEART of Cardiff trail web resource for the trails which features artwork and other contributions of memories and knowledge from participating schools and community members.

The CAER team worked with GAT to create a 'layered map' of memories and reflections based on the group's knowledge of the local area. Fragments of a lively and dynamic conversation about Ely and Caerau were written onto transparent acetate squares and pinned in place onto a large (A0) 1:10,000 scale map of the area. The conversations were also recorded as audio files. Edited fragments of these conversations contribute to the trail's digital resources. This layered map strategy allowed us to plan the first stage of the heritage trail route - a loop from North Ely to St Fagans National History Museum and back through Plymouth Woods starting from the recreation ground at the end of Archer Road. We followed this route on a beautiful sunny day, about a week later with Ceri-Ann Gilbert from GAT as our guide. We later returned to GAT and co-designed a way mark logo for the Plymouth Woodland Walk.

Please provide a brief summary.

To date, the project has involved a myriad of non-HE partners (primary and secondary schools, community groups, youth workers, community development workers, local residents, the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff Story Museum, Glamorgan Archives, Cardiff Council etc.) alongside academics, undergraduates and postgraduates from a range of disciplines at Cardiff (history, archaeology, social sciences). A range of key strategies have been employed by CAER to ensure meaningful co-production and mutual benefit between the wide range of academic, heritage sector and community partners involved. These include: community consultation and involvement in funding bids; the embedding of an academic member of staff (Oliver Davis) within ACE; the development of a close partnership with local secondary schools; the establishment of community-based adult learners courses; the creation of partnerships with a local youth centre and the National Museum of Wales to involve young people facing exclusion in creating a heritage themed art; community outreach opportunities for university students working closely alongside community participants. The wide ranging nature of the project's impacts, partnerships and the embedding of academics and a professional artist within a community context resulted in multifarious, often 'organically' nurtured forms of engagement and co-production. This included the embedding of research co-production within the curricula of participating secondary schools with pupils undertaking geophysical surveys, archaeological excavation, creating museum exhibitions, performances and artwork, heritage trails and participating in a Timeteam programme and two seasons of community excavations. The involvement of professional artist, Paul Evans, in all stages of the project proved a particularly successful strategy. Paul designed and facilitated creative forms of engagement with local heritage themes including large eco-graffiti art installations, puppet shows, heritage trail design and the creation of an Iron-Age themed mural with both local pupils in mainstream secondary education and young people excluded from school. Furthermore, the embedding of research within a series of free accredited adult-education courses in practical archaeology, in association with Cardiff Centre for Lifelong Learning, proved successful in engaging long term unemployed males in co-production - with clear benefits in terms of progression and confidence building for a number of individuals. CAER established innovative and ongoing social and professional partnerships thereby creating a new 'community of practice' (Hart et al, 2012). A crucial ingredient in this creation has been the equal value placed on the contributions and 'knowledge bases' of all partners, whether trained professional or community volunteers. From the outset, community members, secondary schools and community development agencies were integrated in the project's development. This included the establishment of a 'Friends of Caerau' community group which continues to meet bi-monthly and organises litter picks, trail clearances and heritage events. It also included the establishment of a special and ongoing partnership with the management team at two local secondary schools, Glyn Derw and Michaelston Community College, who embedded aspects of local heritage into the curriculum. Moreover, CAER has grown from relatively humble beginnings in 2011 to become one of the key community projects of partner organisation ACE. ACE is a community based organisation which aims to support the social, economic and environmental regeneration of Ely and Caerau. ACE staff worked with the university staff, every step of the way, to plan the development of CAER; providing access to a network of local community groups enabling the involvement of local residents in project activities. ACE facilitated further funding grant successes (e.g. HLF All Our Stories) and ensured that CAER was integrated into, and continues to benefit from, 'Timeplace' (Ely and Caerau's timebank). ACE have therefore brought incredible assets to the project, most notably the trust and networks that they had built up over years with local people and community groups, but also a deep knowledge of the area and an insightful understanding of the challenges faced by these communities. Over time, the academic team and ACE staff developed a mutual respect for each other, more akin to friendship than partnership. These co-production strategies, partnerships and the involvement and commitment of ACE and the community groups have therefore ensured the Project's future beyond existing funding streams and is enabling activities to continue 'on the ground' while further funding grants are secured.

HEART of Cardiff engaged local people of all ages in the design of four linked circular heritage trails which take in important archaeological sites, historic locations and local memories encompassing Caerau and Ely's vibrant history from the Iron Age through the Roman and medieval eras to the Second World War and into the 21st century. 

The trails are accompanied by physical and digital resources which provide archaeological and historical information and folk memories about important local sites way-marking their course. School pupils and community groups have co-designed and co-created these heritage trails linking the communities Caerau and Ely with St Fagans National History Museum. A wide range of participants have worked with professional artist Paul Evans and early career academics Kate Moles (social sciences) and Stephanie Ward (modern social history) to express their findings through heritage themed timelines and way marks as well as contributing significant content to the trails' digital and physical resources.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In close accord with the practices of their partner community development organisation, Action in Caerau and Ely (ACE), and with the recent literature produced by a range of Connected Communities scoping studies, the CAER team were committed to involving community members actively in the co-production of the Heritage trails and the research which informed them; valuing the contribution of all participants and partners in a mutually beneficial and reciprocal relationship. Co-design and co-production have been central to both the ethos and the process behind The HEART of Cardiff Heritage Trail.

Working with Dr Kate Moles and Dr Stephanie Ward, artist Paul Evans devised a series of geographical and temporal mapping workshops to tease out memories of Ely and Caerau and serve to: a) translate the impersonal 1:10,000 scale map produced by the HMSO into a personal, meaningful, local topography based on the thoughts, memories and emotional responses of local residents, and b) create a physical timeline reaching back into living memory. 

The first of these workshops took place at the headquarters of the Grand Avenue Times (GAT) women's community group at Windsor Clive Primary School, Ely. Here we created a 'layered map' of memories and reflections based on the group's knowledge of the local area. Fragments of a lively and dynamic conversation about Ely and Caerau were written onto transparent acetate squares and pinned in place onto a large (A0) 1:10,000 scale map of the area. The conversations were also recorded as audio files. Edited fragments of these conversations contribute to the trail's digital resources. This layered map strategy allowed us to plan the first stage of the heritage trail route - a loop from North Ely to St Fagans National History Museum and back through Plymouth Woods starting from the recreation ground at the end of Archer Road. We followed this route on a beautiful sunny day, about a week later with Ceri-Ann Gilbert from GAT as our guide. 

We also worked with Healthy Wealthy and Wise: senior citizens based at the Old Library, Bishopston Road, Caerau. Over a series of two workshops we created a timeline of memories written onto luggage labels that were ordered chronologically and then tied onto a 4m length of string. Some fascinating and poignant memories emerged from this workshop and these have also informed our planning and content for the heritage trail route. 

Crucial to these workshops was a highly democratic approach valuing all contributions. We also recognised the need to take time to gently build relationships and trust through informal conversation and contact rather than launching directly into 'top down' structured activities, a strategy we have developed through preceding CAER activities. Indeed, the development of constructive relationships was facilitated through a process of listening to, learning from and valuing the memories and perspectives of community members; a process which also yielded some remarkable content and outputs for the trails. 

Outputs from both of these community workshops were subsequently displayed at the CAER Heritage Project/HEART of Cardiff Roadshow at the Ely Festival on 13th July 2013. Central to our presentation was another large map with the speculative HEART of Cardiff Heritage Trail route marked out in pins and coloured thread. Our first suggestion for the route was soon altered on the basis of local knowledge from a wide range of festival-goers. It was here that we were definitively advised that it might be best to break up the heritage trail into manageable circular sections around a central orbit. Once again, contact was informal and involved chatting to and learning about individual stories over a slice of Caerau Hillfort Cake which had been kindly baked for this event by Ceri-Ann of GAT. 

Trail Formation and Pilot Walks (August-December 2013)
Planning and logistical work on the trail continued over the autumn and, in line with recommendations from the Ely Festival, a series of four manageable circular walks (north, south, east and west) were planned onto a map and christened with names in consultation with participating community groups. Following this the Project team undertook a series of four pilot trail walks, over October and November 2013, organised in collaboration with ACE's 'Come Outside' exercise initiative, walking each trail with local residents (between 6 and 20 individuals turned out for each walk) who gave us further interesting insights, facts and local knowledge as we walked the trails and who were rewarded with ACE Time Bank credits for their contributions. 

In December 2013 Dave Wyatt and Paul Evans visited Michaelston College and Glyn Derw to brainstorm, design and develop the first two way-mark designs for the HEART of Cardiff trails. These intensive creative workshops focussed on 'Medieval Michaelston' and the 'Romans to the Races' trails. After a brief introduction by Dave, the young people made a series of quick thumbnail sketches. The young people then selected their favourite sketch and were given guidance on how to convert this design into a simple motif, suitable for stencilling.

Two follow on workshops were delivered to the same classes in each school in March 2014. The challenge behind the workshops was to create transitory, witty works of art that reflected something of the heritage of the trail - creating ephemeral artworks and in situ images to populate our heritage trail resources. At Glyn Derw High we researched Roman motifs and made a series of thumb-nail sketches. We then braved the icy winds blowing over Trelai fields to create an army of buried legionaries emerging from the site of the Roman Villa on the Romans to Races trail. The young artists then made 3D graffiti models and placed these along the trail photographing them as they went. 

A similar workshop was also undertaken with the pupils at Michaelston Community College, this time themed on the medieval heritage of the location including St Michael's church. We decided that the door of the church would make an excellent 'portal' into the past - so we made one using interwoven twigs and branches. As at Glyn Derw, during the next stage of the workshop the young people made individual ephemeral artworks using modelling clay - again from the preliminary sketches based on Medieval motifs. The, tried and tested, combination of archaeological and historically themed art and direct physical engagement with local sites proved an effective means of investing and engaging a new group of young people in their local heritage whilst inculcating a range of creative and interpersonal skills.

In December 2013 the CAER team delivered a way mark logo co-creation workshop with the Friends of Caerau Hillfort group as part of a CAER project Christmas celebration event. Around 15 local residents attended this event with Paul Evans facilitating a workshop to design a striking way mark logo for the Celtic Caerau trail through a collective game of 'Pictionary.' We later returned to GAT in March 2014 and co-designed a way mark logo for the Plymouth Woodland Walk employing the same co-creation strategy.

With the way mark logos complete the designs have been employed to create a series of plastic stencils that have been laser cut with the assistance of teachers at Michaelston Community College. Over April 2014 the community groups and school pupils involved in creating the way mark logos have walked each of their respective trails employing the stencils to make impermanent (chalk, scrubbing surfaces, grass cutting) and permanent marks (spray paint) at key points on the trails to mark the way. 

The HEART of Cardiff Heritage trails were launched collectively as part of the 2014 Cardiff Walking Festival. At the launch visitors were invited to choose one of the HEART of Cardiff trails and join and walk with the local people who helped to create it in a coordinated simultaneous trail walk event that culminated in a gathering of trail walkers from all 4 trails at a heritage fair on the summit of Caerau Hillfort. It is through sustaining regular open access, informal and engaging community heritage events such as this that the CAER Project has built the significant community interest, good will and support which has underpinned the project's success to date and, it is hoped will, ensure its sustainability as an important catalyst for regeneration in this warm and vibrant community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EE2B0A59-0191-44B5-9F69-38FA623E4D92</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://caerheritageproject.com/projects/heart-of-cardiff/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER Project Featured in RCUK Publications including RCUK Inspiration to Engage Concordat Publication and Research for Community Heritage Brochure</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D57985D8-D6E5-435F-86A2-7D0DE2CD9E9A</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/RCUK-prod/assets/documents/publications/ConcordatInspiration.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER team deliver bespoke seminar on co-production strategies to RCUK staff at Polaris House (arranged by NCCPE)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>66AD4DAB-BBE0-449A-85F1-CAD3780C8FFB</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER team meet with Director of Education LEA Cardiff to discuss plans for CAER to inform curriculum in West Cardiff secondary schools</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A58244A0-B0A5-45FC-8288-4604E0E531CE</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER Project the subject of an AHRC Impact Case Study (Hyland/Lugg) and Film</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DF427CC-EA51-453A-BDC2-5B46BE9BD169</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/News/Pages/Research-Councils-UK-(RCUK)-Impact-Report-2013.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER team invited to contribute to advisory session re proposed NCCPE Research for All Journal.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E4D81234-CF08-4046-A035-AF8E2E08706D</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>NCCPE Award highlights CAER Project as an example of best practice re co-production</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58950C95-D2CE-4748-99D9-EC4569F225B4</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/blog/caer-heritage-project</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Heritage Debate in Welsh Government: CAER Project highlighted as a good example of heritage regeneration in Welsh Government Senedd debate on 'ensuring wider access to our heritage and culture' (at 4:12.05) re link below.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>654073A5-374A-4EC8-B51B-20354E416F13</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.senedd.tv/archiveplayer.jsf?v=en_100000_21_01_2014&amp;t=13569&amp;l=en</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER co-production presentation delivered to the RCUK Public Engagement with Research Advisory Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E7BFC69-A5F3-4CE9-8711-24E790CE367F</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The CAER Heritage Project is committed to producing research that involves participants actively in the co-production of knowledge and which values the contributions of all participants and partners. To date the project has involved a myriad of non-HE partners (primary and secondary schools, community groups, youth workers, community development workers, local residents, the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff Story Museum, Glamorgan Archives, Cardiff Council etc) alongside academics, undergraduates and postgraduates from a range of disciplines at Cardiff (history, archaeology, social sciences). Co-production is a term becoming current in some European policy circles (Boyle and Harris 2009; Needham 2008) and in Wales, values of 'community' have long been the rallying cry of Welsh politicians (Rees 1997). Yet, too often, the concept of 'community' is approached by professionals and outsiders simplistically, lacking structures for on-going, systematic means of eliciting and hearing its 'differentiated solidarities' (Young 2002 in Amin 2005, 627). We did not approach the aspiration of co-production uncritically and are aware of the potential issues around power, politics and participation (Gallagher and Gallacher 2008; Holland et al. 2010; Bell 2013). 

A range of key strategies have therefore been employed within the Project to ensure meaningful co-production and mutual benefit between the wide range of academic, heritage sector and community partners involved. These include: community consultation and involvement in funding bids; the embedding of an academic member of staff (Dr. Olly Davis) within our partner community organisation ACE; the embedding of activities in the local secondary school curriculum; the establishment of adult learners courses with a view to facilitating educational progression; the creation of partnerships with a local youth centre and the National Museum of Wales to engage young people facing exclusion; training excavations and community outreach opportunities for university students working closely alongside community participants. The co-production strategies employed are based on well established principles yet the CAER team's approach to these principles and to co-evalution have been recognised as being innovative and potentially radical in relation to Arts and Humanities research (e.g. NCCPE Award &amp;amp; seminar delivered to RCUK)</gtr:description><gtr:id>BCC98C8F-F325-44EA-A803-43E7195B3502</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CAER team's approach to co-production and co-evalution have been recognised as being innovative and potentially radical in relation to Arts and Humanities research for example the CAER Heritage Project was the overall winner of the NCCPE Engage competition and also won thier category of History and Heritage. The project was chosen from 230 quality entries across the UK, both Arts and Humanities and STEM projects. In the words of one of the judges the CAER project '...really did have it all'. Not only did the project make a profound impact on the community who got involved, it also profoundly changed the researchers, animating their work with new insights and expertise and reconnecting them to the educational mission that drives their work.' Winning this NCCPE award was a remarkable achievement given the number of entries received from across a range of discplines, moreover the CAER team were subsuquently invited to present on co-production strategies to RCUK staff in September 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Co-production Strategies in Arts and Humanities</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E4D29DAF-0ADD-4E48-881C-A25FA80CE814"><gtr:id>E4D29DAF-0ADD-4E48-881C-A25FA80CE814</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Forging Communities Past and Present: Caerau Iron Age Hillfort and the CAER Heritage Project'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/171690c569e6692654bacb67e266eac7"><gtr:id>171690c569e6692654bacb67e266eac7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wyatt, D., Davis, O. and Brown, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/21E265DE-6304-42A8-BFF4-DAFBCD9062A5"><gtr:id>21E265DE-6304-42A8-BFF4-DAFBCD9062A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Evaluating community engagement: The CAER Heritage Project'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/260a369dc84bf2de9cd3e0898b06b568"><gtr:id>260a369dc84bf2de9cd3e0898b06b568</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ancarno, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7CD734B4-FA8B-41DA-8F86-69B24099BFE4"><gtr:id>7CD734B4-FA8B-41DA-8F86-69B24099BFE4</gtr:id><gtr:title>After Regeneration: Understanding urban policy and Connected Communities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8369dc2a01f092c9860a45b1e439eabf"><gtr:id>8369dc2a01f092c9860a45b1e439eabf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wyatt, D., Davis, O., Ancarno, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781447324164</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/187F076C-9E7F-48D1-AAA5-978DAE36E7F4"><gtr:id>187F076C-9E7F-48D1-AAA5-978DAE36E7F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Researching in Public: Contested Origins, Live Debates &amp;amp;
