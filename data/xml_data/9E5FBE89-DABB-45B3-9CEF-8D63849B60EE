The RelMiCS Conference is the main forum for the relational calculus as a conceptual and methodological tool. The AKA Workshop is a forum on topics related to Kleene algebras. As in previous years, the two events are co-organised. The next joint RelMiCS/AKA will be organised at the School of Computer Science of the University of Manchester from 29 August to 2 September 2006 in Manchester.For the first time, a PhD training programme will be co-organised with the conference. The goal of the PhD programme is to introduce doctoral students and young researchers to the methods, foundations and applications of the research area. It also offers possibilities for young researchers to present their own work, to get in contact with their peers, to explore new avenues of thinking, to learn collectively and to exchange ideas in a very active and stimulating manner. In particular, doctoral students will have the opportunity to follow a programme of tutorials in related areas on the mathematical foundations of relational methods and Kleene algebra, and applications in the area of program refinement. There will be a student session in which participants can introduce and discuss their PhD projects and present their results. Outstanding student papers will be considered for presentation at the main conference and publication in the LNCS proceedings.The PhD programme includes attendance at the main conference and co-located workshops. The PhD programme will therefore also provide an excellent opportunity for young researchers to get an overview of current research, attend talks of seasoned presenters and get in contact with the experts in the field. In the UK a particularly strong community in the areas of interest exists and a fruitful exchange with related communities can be expected. Besides the general topics that are evident from the name, the main conference will be strongly focused on formal methods for software engineering, program logics and links with other neighbouring disciplines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-02-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-08-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4752</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The main beneficiaries of the training were the students participating. The tutorials provided a solid theoretical background and an exemplary application of relational methods to a formal software engineering task. The student session allowed them to present their work, gain valuable experience and establish contacts with peers. The conference helped them obtain an overview on their field and the
students met leading international experts at the conference which gave them the opportunity to discuss their work and widen their horizon. As is usual for a conference like this, participants were given the opportunity
to establish and strengthen useful contacts, exchange ideas, discuss joint publications,
and in some cases even arrange research visits.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>198E16B7-76B3-43FC-BDEC-FF8167A7E27E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project provided funding for a PhD training programme at the 9th International

The programme brought together researchers from the theory and the application side in an early stage of their career. For the future, this might significantly contribute to a higher level of formal rigour in software engineering and to better deductive support for formal methods.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B4E3831B-47A3-4885-A928-1B1D1D6A8D66</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~schmidt/relmics06/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1990D473-55C5-4E4D-A7ED-0A3F5CEBF2D2"><gtr:id>1990D473-55C5-4E4D-A7ED-0A3F5CEBF2D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Relations and Kleene Algebra in Computer Science (Proc.
