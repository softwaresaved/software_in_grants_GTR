(SOLACE)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/R005958/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Philippines is a Lower Middle Income Country (LMIC) with a population of 100 million. The country's geography with many isolated rural areas, the poverty levels (25% live below the poverty line) and the weak infrastructure make equitable access to health care for the population a big challenge. Clinicians in the Philippines usually do not want to work as primary care doctors in rural areas. Only 10% of the country's clinicians work in these areas where more than half of the population lives. The shortage of primary care doctors in such regions is one of the most urgent challenges for public health in the Philippines. This is also the case in other LMICs as well as countries in the global north. Likewise in the UK there are many rural areas faced with a shortage of health professionals. Another change in the health landscape is that people around the world are living longer and the disease burden is being increasingly dominated by disability instead of people dying early. The main causes of death and disability have changed from communicable diseases in children to non-communicable diseases in adults (for instance, mental health, musculoskeletal diseases, strokes, diabetes). To address these problems in a cost and clinically effective way, strong evidence-based systems of primary care are essential to identify healthcare needs and to develop and implement strategies for addressing those needs.

It is precisely around those areas the partnership will work: equal distribution of health workers and efficient primary care for people with non-communicable diseases. SOLACE brings together researchers from different disciplines (medicine, arts and humanities) who are keen to work with colleagues who they would not normally work with. The partnership activities will allow these researchers from Keele University (UK) and Ateneo de Manila University (Philippines) to learn new research methods and to use original ways to bring the results to several stake holders: academics, governmental and community organisations and, most importantly, the people living in rural and remote areas.

We will establish two SOLACE health hubs in Northern Samar, a rural province in the Philippines. About 60 participants (patients, doctors, community workers and local politicians) will come together for a Cultural Animation workshop in these hubs. Over a period of 10 months all participants will create artistic, personal health diaries. They will also get together every month for a discussion group and will meet a SOLACE researcher on a regular basis who will carry out fieldwork in the participants' home and work environments. The health diaries (in many formats: texts, songs, drawings, films, pictures), the discussion group and fieldwork data will be analysed by the Keele and Ateneo teams. The Keele team will visit Northern Samar for a fieldwork trip and the Ateneo team will travel to Keele for a research and capacity building week. Also two cultural exchange visits with Keele and Ateneo student pairs from medicine, arts and humanities will take place. 

The SOLACE website will host a blog and podcasts, photo reportages, audiovisual documentaries and online educational resources will be regularly uploaded. There will be two public exhibitions, in Keele and Manila, showcasing fieldwork photos and artistic health diaries curated by the participants themselves. We will also hold two SOLACE health festivals in Northern Samar, bringing the results back to the local communities and demonstrating why active patient and public engagement is important in health research.

Our ambition is to lay the foundations for a 'SOLACE tradition' in global public health which can be expanded to other LMICs. Interdisciplinary research carried out in this tradition will be characterised by sustained and genuine engagement with local communities, dissolving knowledge hierarchies, and co-producing innovative public health initiatives and clinical interventions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The objective of impacting on potential users of research across a wide range of constituencies is embedded in the SOLACE partnership proposal throughout. We will replicate impact strategies used in the AHRC-funded Cultural Animation studies which received outstanding impact. We will also draw on the Keele tradition in creating strong and sustainable impact through public health and primary care research. Indeed, the Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences at Keele University has been ranked first in the UK in the 2014 REF with respect to the impact of our research.

PATHWAYS TO ACADEMIC IMPACT
In addition to establishing a hitherto unparalleled interdisciplinary partnership in public health (breadth: research, education, public engagement and depth: artistic personal health diaries created by different stake holders blended with ethnographic data), the anticipated theoretical development and research agenda arising from its innovative interdisciplinary approach, ensures that SOLACE will make a significant contribution to interdisciplinary global public health research and lay a foundation which other researchers may take forward in discrete areas and lines of enquiry.

PATHWAYS TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL IMPACT
Under resourced health workforces is a topic of increasing interest for the wider public in developed as well as developing countries. The issues the partnership addresses-around human health resources, role of primary care and non-communicable diseases-are increasingly aired in the public domain, hence the potential for wide economic and social impact. SOLACE will raise awareness around the effect of unbalanced primary care workforces on local healthcare needs, both in treatment of and living with non-communicable diseases in rural and remote areas. It provides a new model of arts-based community engagement and encourages patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE). The partnership will develop and maintain, through the SOLACE health hubs, PPIE groups, one of the first in the Philippines, which will provide an important resource beyond the duration of the partnership. By promoting the active partnership between patients, members of the public and researchers we will maximise impact not only during the funded period, but also in future work by recognizing and supporting the unique roles users have in research prioritisation, design and management, data collection and analysis and dissemination of findings.

The SOLACE partnership has the potential to have impact on (1) the everyday practices of health professionals, both those working in LMICs as well as those in the global north, (2) the understanding of how policies and devolved governance affect the health and wellbeing of local communities and, most importantly, (3) the daily lives of people living in underserved areas. Active participation in SOLACE will empower those patients as they will see, throughout the two years, how their concerns and ideas are taking seriously and embedded in future research projects.

The SOLACE findings will add considerably to our understanding of the challenges all stakeholder groups in underserved rural and isolated areas face, as well as which solutions to those challenges already exists in the local communities. SOLACE will produce a range of outputs which translate the implications of our findings into educational and artistic sustainable resources for the future's workforces in medicine and in the creative sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172077</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R005958/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E2F513B-B936-4DF8-B28D-0ADC57F8BFC7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropological Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnography &amp; Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6A8697C-69DA-4020-8D45-9901CA002827</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Global Health and Medicine</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
