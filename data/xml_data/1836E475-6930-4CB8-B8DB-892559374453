Yet, life on Earth is not evenly distributed, so that some groups of organisms contain many more species than others, while some environments are a hotbed for promoting unique species diversity. The tropical lakes of Africa's rift valley, considered to be hotspots of biodiversity, are such environments and provide evolutionary biologists with a unique opportunity to study the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for species formation. By studying species rich faunal lineages that span both lacustrine and riverine environments, it will be possible to not only further our knowledge of processes leading to species radiations within lakes, but determine the extent to which lake environments have influenced the genetic diversity of species within African rivers. Furthermore, a broad species distribution also allows biologists to examine whether past geological or climatic events have had an impact on the current patterns of biodiversity, which may help us make future predictions regarding biodiversity and therefore their conservation. The highly diverse catfish genus Synodontis, containing c.120 species, is selected here, to investigate the factors influencing biological diversity in freshwater environments, as it meets all these criteria. Using DNA data from Synodontis catfish collected across Africa, combined with fossil dates, we shall be able to reconstruct the evolutionary history of their relationships. This will be important as it will enable us to determine if certain species groups evolved within lake basins and whether speciation in these environments happened faster than in rivers. We are also interested to see whether there might be morphological differences in body shape for example, associated with shifts between different aquatic realms. Finally, we will examine geographic patterns to test whether tectonic rifting events, or drier periods in Africa's climate have influenced the evolution of Synodontis catfish. The results of this study can then be compared with other freshwater faunas in order to find generalities that will help us to better understand the processes that have promoted current biodiversity of tropical freshwaters. This study provides a unique and feasible opportunity to examine diversification in this species-rich group, as we are fortunate that the majority of tissue samples are collected and available to begin work upon.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51534</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In comparison to insular systems such as lakes and islands, relatively little is known about the processes driving continental wide species diversification. My recent study (Day et al. 2013) generated molecular data to infer evolutionary relationships for the highly species rich catfish group Synodontis (~120 species) that occur throughout freshwater habitats of Sub-Saharan Africa. Using methods that estimate diversification rate (speciation and extinction) from the evolutionary tree, we were able to investigate the generation of diversity in this group over the course of their evolutionary history.

This work represents a significant advance in our understanding of continental diversification by demonstrating a constant diversification rate in an aquatic clade (i.e. no difference in speciation and extinction rates) through out the mid-Cenozoic to recent (over 40 Million years), despite the changing environmental conditions that were prevalent during this time period. This finding contrasts to previous studies of species-rich terrestrial radiations that commonly show an early burst, followed by a slow down in rate, which is generally interpreted as the filling of ecological niches. In contrast our study suggests that tropical continental diversification may not be as limited by ecological opportunities. This study was published in Systematic Biology and already has 13 citations. 
An earlier study on this catfish group (Day et al. 2009) reported an unexpected discovery in that Southern African Synodontis catfish form a radiation that could have diversified in an extinct lake and therefore highlighted the effects of palaeo-landscapes on present day biodiversity. This paper also revisited the radiation of these catfish in the biodiversity hotspot Lake Tanganyika to further investigate evolutionary relationships by comparing different molecular datasets, and confirmed previous findings (Day and Wilkinson, 2006) based only on one genetic marker.

During the collection of samples for these projects we were also able to obtain samples for other fish groups e.g. mastacemblid eels, which provide a comparative system in which to investigate patterns and processes of diversification. Brown et al. (2010) represents the first phylogenetic analysis of these cryptic eel-like fish from Lake Tanganyika that have a very different biology to other lake fish radiations e.g. Synodontis catfish. This study reveals a relatively recent diversification scenario in full lake conditions that has likely been facilitated by lake level fluctuations. This paper was rated as 'Highly accessed'.

This grant also allowed me to collect morphological data of these catfish, which we have combined with the phylogeny of Day et al. (2013). We demonstrated the independent evolution of taxa from different drainage basins produced similar morphologies, and furthermore revealed Lake Tanganyika taxa occupied a similar area of morphospace compared to the entire continental radiation (Peart &amp;amp; Day, in prep.). This is an exciting finding considering that less than 10% of Synodontis diversity is found in this rift lake, compared to the majority of their diversity that occurs in rivers, suggesting that lake environments are more conducive to generating morphological novelties.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings provide comparative data to further investigate evolutionary processes and the origins and maintenance of biodiversity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>375A369D-4971-4AEB-B183-BE3CDFB36053</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CC7FEE06-F4C8-4D5D-867A-C2AEA31FABB8"><gtr:id>CC7FEE06-F4C8-4D5D-867A-C2AEA31FABB8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lacustrine radiations in African Synodontis catfish.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of evolutionary biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e60984077a0eb1d4c777e3b6fd038255"><gtr:id>e60984077a0eb1d4c777e3b6fd038255</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Day JJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1010-061X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0FA4767A-11A3-4851-AB61-FAE09A516B6C"><gtr:id>0FA4767A-11A3-4851-AB61-FAE09A516B6C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Continental diversification of an African catfish radiation (Mochokidae: Synodontis).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Systematic biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e60984077a0eb1d4c777e3b6fd038255"><gtr:id>e60984077a0eb1d4c777e3b6fd038255</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Day JJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1063-5157</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/257CDCBB-5A86-400A-923C-0CA640656933"><gtr:id>257CDCBB-5A86-400A-923C-0CA640656933</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mastacembelid eels support Lake Tanganyika as an evolutionary hotspot of diversification.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC evolutionary biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f5e842bd28bdab3c2f81b3b34b951843"><gtr:id>f5e842bd28bdab3c2f81b3b34b951843</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown KJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2148</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/F000782/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A4209D5A-2E41-4290-9D1A-3172C1F48962</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Population Genetics/Evolution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2CF6994C-A1AE-435B-853C-2C228927BC9E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systematics &amp; Taxonomy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
