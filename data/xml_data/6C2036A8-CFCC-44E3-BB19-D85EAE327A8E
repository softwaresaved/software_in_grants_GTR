A study of inequities in health and long-term care among the elderly in rural China</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N002717/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposed study seeks to address key questions concerning the health and LTC among rural elderly in China, bridging the research gap in this area, and offering policy suggestions. People above the age of 60 account for more than 15% of the Chinese rural population. This percentage is expected to increase in the next few decades. In rural China, elderly people are relying on family members to provide care. However, as more and more young people are migrating to big cities, the expectation that family members will be available to provide care for rural elderly is becoming unrealistic. Institutional LTC care is usually expensive in China, and although the government partially reimburses the costs through a social health insurance scheme or other mechanisms, service users are still responsible for a substantial amount of co-payments. These costs may be too expensive for the rural elderly living in poverty to afford, which exacerbates the issue of unequal access to care. 

The proposed study seeks to examine inequities in health and LTC among rural elderly in China. This study will first examine whether the socioeconomic status of the rural elderly is associated with their health status. It will then assess the impact of a non-communicable disease prevention and control programme on rural elderly with different socioeconomic backgrounds, and also examine whether the needs of the rural elderly population can be sufficiently addressed with home-based care support. The study will simulate the population structure of the rural Chinese in the next few decades, and predict whether the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) (the only financial support available to the rural elderly to finance their LTC) will be sustainable in the long term. It will draw lessons on LTC financing from other developed countries, and propose potential policy recommendations for decision makers. 

The study results will benefit a number of stakeholders including policy makers who are designing ageing-related policies in China, organisations specialising in home-based LTC services, the rural elderly and their family carers. The study results will reveal how the current health status and patterns of health care and LTC use among the rural elderly differ across different socioeconomic groups. The intention is to inform the policy making process and encourage policy makers to re-examine existing health and LTC policies. Organisations specialising in home-based LTC will also benefit from this study, because this study aims to identify whether the current family care is able to meet the needs of the elderly and identify areas where there may be opportunities to develop formal home-based LTC care. Finally, this study will benefit rural elderly and their family members by engaging them in various dissemination activities and dialogues with policy makers and other relevant parties. 

This study will employ sophisticated econometrics methods, such as the Concentration Index, Instrumental Variables (IV), and various other simulation models. Data will be drawn from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). This study builds on initial quantitative skills in health inequity research I have developed from my previous work (e.g. the Concentration Index and Panel Data Regressions), and is complemented by training opportunities that the Future Research Leaders Scheme provides (e.g. advanced quantitative courses and various knowledge exchange workshops). The scheme will put me in a position to deliver strong evidence-based policy research that can influence policies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed study is designed to address key questions concerning the health and LTC among the rural elderly in China, bridging the research gap in this area and offering policy suggestions. This proposed study will benefit a wide range of audience members. Potential beneficiaries and stakeholders are listed as follows:
1. Policy makers
National level: National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC; formerly the Ministry of Health) of the People's Republic of China, Ministry of Civil Affairs (MoCA)
Provincial level: Provincial MoCA and Committee of Ageing (CoA), Zhejiang Province
This proposed study aims to reveal issues relating to inequities in health and LTC systems among the rural Chinese elderly, provide evidence of current and future need and demands of health and LTC services among rural elderly in China, as well as offer policy recommendations. At a national level, the study results may be used to raise awareness and inform policy makers in the NHFPC about health and LTC policies in rural China. In particular, RQ4 seeks to use a probabilistic population projection model and possibly other related simulation methods to conduct population level projections, and this will inform policy makers on the sustainability of the current Chinese health and LTC system, and offer recommendations regarding LTC policies for the rural elderly. Policy makers will be invited to become members of the advisory group, participate in the project workshop and conference, as well as comment on the research papers and the plain language report. 

2. NGOs and other related social care organisations
RQ3 in this proposed study focuses on family care and other types of home-based LTC in rural areas. The findings may be useful for related adult social care service providers or organisations as evidence for developing activities relating to home-based elderly care in rural China. 

The proposed research plans to make contact with home-based LTC providers through the researchers at Zhejiang University. Using the CHARLS survey Zhejiang sub-survey, the proposed research will present results on the level of unmet needs for the rural elderly who receive home-based care and identify relevant areas that social care providers or organisations should focus on. Representatives from social care providers will also be invited to attend workshops and exchange opinions and knowledge with government officials, academic researchers and service users, in order to inform their practice.

3. Rural elderly, family members of rural elderly in China
Issues relating to inequities in health status and the utilisation of health and LTC among the rural elderly should be examined and should be recognised. It is important to note that the burden of family care of the rural elderly should not only be shared with the elderly and their families, but also with the wider society. The proposed study calls for attention to be paid by the government, to take responsibility for provision of publicly-subsidised social care for the rural elderly. This will also reduce the burden for the rural family. The proposed research plans to invite rural elderly and their family members to project workshops and other relevant events. These events will provide the rural elderly with opportunities to express their opinions, and engage in the policy dialogue with the decision makers and academics. They will also be invited to comment on the draft of the plain language report, which will be disseminated to relevant parties. 

4. Academics
Limited research has been carried out in the field of LTC in rural China. This research will raise the awareness of health and LTC research among Chinese and international scholars, bridge the research gap, provide new findings and call for more engagement in the field of health and LTC research in China.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>227206</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N002717/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>470A4BAD-2FF4-45D6-80F3-00EED5B229D5</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/N002717/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>269147.82</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-01-11</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-08-16</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>6C2036A8-CFCC-44E3-BB19-D85EAE327A8E</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/N002717/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>227206.4</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-08-17</gtr:start><gtr:end>2019-05-17</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6A8697C-69DA-4020-8D45-9901CA002827</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Global Health and Medicine</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E398036B-8D9A-43E0-BBBA-AF0932365C69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
