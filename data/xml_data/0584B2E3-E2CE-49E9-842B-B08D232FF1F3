An Investigation of the Traffic Between London, Hong Kong and Beijing</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J017272/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This research investigates an emerging migration circuit with important implications for the UK, China and its Special Administrative Region (SAR) Hong Kong. It explores the social composition of the traffic along these circuits and drills into the calculations, strategies and reasoning of young migrants aged between 22 and 32 years old.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Extending BIS?s and other researchers? focus from students, the focus of this study will be university graduates who have migrated independently and no longer in education: young people, importantly, at the launch-point of their careers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We want to know:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>who these young migrants are and why they migrate along these routes. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>what resources or attributes they anticipate migration provides them and how they intend deploying these in their own personal/professional lives&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the thinking behind their journeys - how do they compare departure and arrival cities. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>In short, we want to know how mobility plays-out in how young migrants think about themselves and their lives. We expect to uncover new links between biography and geography and thus make important theoretical and empirical contributions to migration studies as well as to the burgeoning field of mobility studies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research spans three jurisdictions in the UK, Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the connections between them in the movements of skilled, graduate young migrants. Because it is timely, topical and important, the findings of this research are highly likely to be of significant interest to governments, policy makers, NGOs, public bodies (Universities and their International Offices) trade and commerce organizations (like the CBI) in all three places. In publication and dissemination plans the project aims to maximize the potential impact of the research findings, in particular, in the UK through collaboration with the Runnymede Trust, Britain's leading think tank on race, ethnicity and migration, who are especially interested in the under-researched area of Chinese migrants in the UK. Additionally through the Hong Kong PI we have strong links with the SAR Government, and, through the UK PI and the Hong Kong PI strong connections with the State-sponsored Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). Each of these organizations allows access to further networks and is one of the advantages of this collaboration. Our impact plans target the audiences detailed below. 

All three governments have a natural interest in decision-making among their most highly skilled and mobile young migrants. In a competitive global economy 'brain-drains' and 'brain-gains' are important. The UK Government is not monitoring recent changes made to post study work visas and has almost no information about the 6 million UK citizens, many highly skilled, who live overseas. We have a strong commitment to working with policy and third sector organizations and our dissemination plans put this into practice with the help of Runnymede Trust and CASS. Our 3 booklets summarizing key findings and policy implications in each jurisdiction will be launched at high profile receptions in all three cities. In Beijing and Hong Kong launches will combine with half day seminars with invited audiences of policy-makers, journalists, UK-China trade organizations like the CBI and government officials. In the UK in collaboration with Runnymede Trust we will launch our booklet and project summary at the House of Lords to an audience identified and invited by Runnymede for their involvement in migration policy. Our overall summary of the project will be published on line on the Runnymede website which is a tool used by policy makers involved with ethnicity and migration. The article in the Runnymede Bulletin, which has a circulation of 5000, will ensure an even wider audience for our findings and their implications. Through CASS and its connections with the Chinese Government we can distribute our booklets to relevant officials and invite them to our launch. CASS, like Runnymede, has good media connections. We can get invited to appear on CCTV (The Chinese state TV station). The UK PI has made regular appearances on BBC radio 4 'Thinking Allowed' and can use this link to publicize this project. She also writes frequently for the Times Higher Education Supplement and can publicize our finding through this route too. In Hong Kong we have strong connections with Central Planning Unit, the Census and Statistics Department of the SAR as well as think tanks and political parties. Generally, our combined networks place us in a good position to engage with policy and political audiences. 

In the short term we are well placed get our message across to the media and a range of political, and policy interests, NGOs, Universities, trade and commerce groups, embassies and the British Council, through press releases, launches etc. In the long and medium term we will be able to build on these initial contacts with more sustained involvement through our publication and public presentations. In particular our findings will become part of the Runnymede Trust website which is used nation-wide as a resource by bodies seeking information.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79696</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article for Discover Society</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B9EC79D-C494-4272-8D56-EB64D886FDE0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This article - Millionaire Welcome - discusses recent changes in immigration rules and how these support the migration of wealthier migrants, including wealthy Chinese.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.discoversociety.org/millionaires-welcome-uk-migration-and-london-neighbourhoods/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch of Young Londoners in Beijing - at Peking University, Beijing</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1F4C6CDA-8265-444E-A99E-C317B65131B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Launch for approximately 50 people at Peking University with RCUK representatives in Beijing, the British Council, Prof Zhu, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the study participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch at the House of Lords of Report, Youg Chinese Migrants in London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3CFE548-FEF1-42C6-A433-1C221D5360C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Report from the London side of this research was launched at the House of Lords on June 25th 2015 by Merlene Emmerson.

Our London findings were launched at the House of Lords in June 2015 by Merlene Emmerson. Participants included Lord Cotter, Baroness Hussein-Ece and a range of Chinese welfare organisations and lobby groups, including representatives from the Chinese-Britain Forum, Chinese Liberal Democrats, the Runnymede Trust who co-sponsored the even, Soho Outreach, Islington Chinese Welfare association, the Chinese Welfare Trust, and representatives from Lord Wei of Shoreditch's Diaspora Emerging Leadership Programme, as well as the study participants. 

These are impacts on broader publics through the media and on politicians and policy makers concerning the status of Chinese migrants in London and Mainland Chinese migrants in Hong Kong.

The Beijing data was launched at Peking University (2016) in partnership with the British Council, RCUK China, Prof Zhu of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the study participants.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>90CD0BDB-0E47-44DC-B320-9259D6C3DB72</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Most Significant Achievements from the Grant are: -

(1) To update our conceptions of Chinese migration and draw attention to the importance of Chinese migrants in the UK and in London specifically. 
(2) To draw attention to the little researched potential importance of young migrants to Beijing and to London, post-study, at the launching point of their adult professional lives, and to understand how the prospect of global mobility, along certain routes, shapes their life and career plans. 
(3) To have developed empirically the concept of 'Chinese London' rather than 'Chinese in London' as a way of exploring the contemporary significance of recent, young and China-born migrants to London, and their impact on the city's shifting ethnic and class geographies. 
(4) To show that in developing the concept of Chinese London empirically we need to add other strands of Chinese activity passing through London, including capital transfers: investments in infrastructural projects, housing markets and tourism, and not just distributions of migrant bodies. Migration scholarship, in other words, needs to be open to broader strands of global movement and activity. 
(5) To show that cities are important in condensing the impact of migration and the investments and other strands of globalisation that move along the same routes as migrants. Migration conventionally privileges the nation-state scale of analysis. Our research shows that significant dynamics and dialogues are established between cities, as we reveal how these dynamics work on the London, Beijing, Hong Kong circuit. 
(6) To show that changes in one city ripple through the cities connected with it, through the modality of migrants' journeys. 
(7) To show that young migrants in London who come from Hong Kong are, in addition to developing their CVs by working in London's financial sector, responding to recent changes in their own city, and especially large-scale migration from the Chinese Mainland, which brings a significant transformation of life in Hong Kong. 
(8) Likewise, to show that young Beijingers are responding to recent changes in Beijing as they take advantage of the new opportunity for mobility throughout and beyond China to travel. And, most importantly, to secure assets accumulated by older generations by investing them in London beyond the reach of the Chinese state. We found many examples of Chinese capital from chemical plants and Beijing property invested in London by young migrants on behalf of their families. 
(9) To show that both groups of Chinese migrants in London are responding to the uncertainties of contemporary life in their home cities, challenging the conventional wisdom in migration studies that only arrival nations matter and that it is not important to think about departure cities. 
(10) To show that the same holds for young Londoners in Beijing. These young migrants are, like their Beijing and Hong Kong counterparts in London, from privileged backgrounds. Denied opportunities to develop their potential on the London job market in arts and cultural industries - and not interested in London's financial and related sector - they seek jobs in Beijing where they can afford the kind of independent adult lifestyles they cannot afford in London. They make use of Beijing's vibrant arts and cultural sectors to develop careers in writing, journalism, art, drama and music, they would have difficulty in establishing in London. Beijing makes possible what London does not, confirming a dialogic link between cities as young migrants live them.
(11) To show that it is important to think about the dynamics of what are referred to as 'skilled migration'. Conventionally political and popular debate in the UK considers only immigration, not emigration. But increasingly young Britons are moving overseas, presenting a significant brain drain. 
(12) To show that it is inappropriate to think of incoming migrants to the UK as 'poor' and lacking in employment, linguistic and cultural skills. This is clearly not the case when it comes to the kinds of elite, fluently bilingual Chinese migrants to London, which our study highlights. And this is not the case more generally either as the UK migration rules now favour wealthier migrants over others.
(13) To show that the dominant UK conception of 'the immigrant' is loaded and out dated and call for an appropriate updating of the existing literature on ethnicity, migration and cities. 

The Grant Objectives were met in: -
(1) Mapping the scale and directions of travel of young migrants on the Beijing-London-Hong Kong circuit from existing databases. 
(2) Developing sociological portraits of young migrants, which reveal their diverse reasons for migrating and the skills they deploy in the process. 
(3) Revealing the thinking underlying young migration and the ways in which young compare cities in which they might live and work.
(4) Exploring the ways in which the possibilities of migrant mobility inflect the calculations young migrants make about their personal/professional lives. 
(5) Establishing the different priorities young migrants from these 3 cities has, and from this the ways in which cities matter.

Unmet Objectives: -
We didn't get the 600 per city street-survey responses we would have liked as a context for our in-depth qualitative study. Instead an online questionnaire received far fewer responses. 

The Objectives Might Be Taken Forward in these Ways: -
(1) Expanding the study to include more respondents and respondents from more varied social/professional locations. 
(2) Expanding the geographical spread of respondents to other parts of Beijing and London from those parts of each city that were surveyed. 
(3) Repeating the study in other UK/ Chinese Mainland cities to see if we get different results.
(4) Doing a follow-up study 5 years on with the same respondents to see what decisions they have actually taken about migration. 
(5) These objectives could be realised in a bigger, China/UK, nationwide study in each country with the help of partners and partner institutions. Discussions are underway with Prof Roger Burrows and Dr Andrew Law, School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape, Newcastle University about developing a large ESRC/ERC bid in order to examine Chinese influence in key UK cities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings could potentially be used to: 
(1) Shift UK conceptions of 'the migrant' and to take more notice of emigration rather than immigration.
(2) Take a a broader approach to understanding Chinese influence in London and the UK more generally. 
(3) Facilitate private industry in using the links established between the UK and China by young migrants to explore the opportunities provided by Chinese markets, especially those for luxury goods.
(4) Develop better cultural and intellectual links between China and the UK, and specifically between London, Hong Kong and Beijing.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D671F47B-CCC5-4202-BEA5-822C6A354152</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Financial Services,
