Engage rural Welsh communities to build science capital

Science capital encompasses a person's science-related qualifications, understanding, knowledge, interest and social contact. The extent of one's science capital can dictate aspirations related to scientific pursuits, not just for those exposed to science, but for their families as well (according to the Science Aspirations and Career Choice: Age 10-14 (ASPIRES) project). This project will utilise a communications channel that has a traditional presence in Welsh society to bring science and its discoveries to individuals in rural communities that do not typically have access to science programming. By engaging these communities it is hoped that participants will take on an improved understanding of the role of science in their lives and spark their interest in engaging further with science and thereby build science capital within their homes and communities.

Stimulate an interest in science for unengaged participants broadly

Beyond reaching rural Welsh communities, by utilising the existing cultural medium of storytelling this project will bring together diverse groups across Welsh society that are engaged in the storytelling community but may not be engaged with science. This provides an opportunity to reach new audiences with scientific programming. By reaching unengaged groups it is hoped that the programme will stimulate an interest in these groups to learn more about the topics presented or to attend other science focused events in the future.

Empower scientists to communicate their research to non-technical audiences

Scientists have amazing stories to tell, but they are often deterred from engaging those outside of their field or discipline as science is frequently depicted as unintelligible to non-specialists. The informal atmosphere of science storytelling provides a unique and exciting platform through which scientists can reach new audiences and foster connections with attendees and contributors. It is envisioned that by utilising science storytelling and providing training for participants, this project will increase the confidence of our speakers from the science community to share their message with a wider audience and encourage them to take part in other science communications events in the future, further spreading their work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In order to reach disengaged audiences with science storytelling events, it will be essential that these audiences can be made aware that the events are taking place. This will require substantial marketing activities that the IOP will carry out with the support of its marketing and communications teams. In order to reach disengaged audiences, rural and otherwise, advertisements will be place in local papers and on local radio for promotion and social media will be utilised to publicise the event. To further target rural audiences, organisations that are popular amongst rural communities and with which we have an established relationship, such as the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show, will be contacted to share information on the events with their members. Storytelling circles throughout Wales will also be informed of the events to encourage participation and ensure that traditional storytelling continues to play a central role. 

To reach beyond the audiences in attendance at each event, digital recordings will be made of each of the storytelling events and these recordings will be made available online and publicised through the Institute of Physics' channels, including Physics World. This will make each event's stories available to the IOP's 50,000 members as well as to the 109,000 followers of the Institute's @physicsnews twitter feed, and thousands more on regional and individual feeds.

Each of the scientists that participates in an event will receive training from a storyteller, ideally beginning a process of skill dissemination among the scientific community as similar events propagate. 

Lessons learned from these events will be shared with a wide network of fellow science communicators throughout Wales and the rest of the UK. Within the Institute of Physics, this includes frequent communication with a UK-wide network of regional offices, Schools Outreach Support Network in universities and IOP member groups. Within Wales, this could include the other institutes and societies with which we collaborate; including the Welsh Universities, Royal Society of Chemistry and the Cardiff Science Communication Group. Abigail Ashton is connected to the UK science communication community and will use channels such as the PsciCom mailing list, BSA's Collective Memory and British Interactive Group conference to communicate progress, successes and failures of the the project. These connections will be used in conjunction with the IOP Blog and the IOP Wales page to share information throughout the community regarding project progress and success.

The Stimulating Physics Network, the IOP's teacher CPD programme, running in Wales with Welsh Government and Waterloo Foundation funding also creates a vehicle for us to share examples of effective communication to educators in Wales, as well as through our teacher conference in Brecon and our wider teacher network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9410</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P006086/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
