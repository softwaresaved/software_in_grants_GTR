The most familiar is Joule heating: this is how a lightbulb and a toaster works. Another example is electromigration: current exerts forces on atoms, much like a river pushes rocks in its way. These current-induced forces can make atoms migrate, leading to the formation of defects in the conductor that can ultimately cause it to break down.In recent years experimentalists have been able to produce conductors of truly atomic dimensions - the smallest possible in nature - such as an atomic chain or a molecule between two electrodes. The excitement of these novel structures is the vision of molecular-scale electronics: electronic devices and circuit elements down on the size scale of individual atoms and molecules.But the current densities in these tiny wires can be very large - up to ten to the power of fifteen amps per square metre - many orders of magnitude larger than in an ordinary lightbulb for example. Under these huge current densities everything is big: both Joule heating and current-induced forces in nanowires can be very large, and can blow the conductor to pieces. We have worked for years on the theory and modelling of these effects in atomic-scale devices, and recently we have made a discovery: interatomic bonding forces in atomic wires under current are non-conservative, meaning that they can do net work on the atoms when they are taken on a closed path. We demonstrated the consequences for the simplest possible geometry: an atomic chain with a bend. There, the current drives and accelerates the bend atom in an expanding orbit, creating an elemental, single-atom waterwheel.This discovery found an immediate resonance within the science community through two News-and-Views articles in the Nature journals, and immediately opens up two new directions for research. (i) The non-conservative forces are a new mechanism for energy transfer from the current to the atoms, quite distinct from Joule heating. We have already given reasons, in our original Nature Nanotechnology paper, to believe that this mechanism can be more powerful than Joule heating. Therefore, it could be the new non-conservative effects, and not ordinary heating, that are the key factor limiting the stability and functionality of molecular electronic devices. (ii) Our atomic waterwheel shows that these forces can also be used constructively to drive atomic-scale engines.Our present project will develop new simulation tools to investigate these two possibilities from first principles and model the effects of the non-conservative forces in nanoscale conductors. We will model and understand how much effective heating these forces can produce, and whether they have the ability to destroy atomic wires. We will explore another novel idea: that the non-conservative waterwheel effect, and not Joule heating, could serve as the activation mechanism for electromigration of atoms on surfaces and in interfaces. Finally, together with experimentalists in Leiden, we will investigate a possible device that can act as a current-driven atomic-scale motor: a molecule on a current-carrying surface with a freely rotating side group, with the surface current driving the rotor like a watermill. In addition to the experimental group in Leiden we have joined forces also with a leading theory group in Denmark, who have taken up our discovery and have started their own long-term programme of research into it. Although the goal is shared, our theoretical approaches are mutually complementary and, together with our experimental friends, we aim not only to explore these new phenomena, but also to create a new direction of research in our dynamic field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? Through meeting the demands of the 2009 ITRS (see Impact plan for details) we will feed into the needs of the semiconductor industry. In year 4 of the project we will host a dissemination and exploitation workshop involving our immediate collaborators and invitees from Intel, Seagate and other industries, as well as delegates from Invest Northern Ireland. The workshop will be open to other interested parties, in particular researchers from transport, time-dependent density-functional theory and the atomistic simulation of non-adiabatic electron-ion dynamics. This meeting will strengthen the interdisciplinarity of the project by bringing these areas together. Our training plans for the PDRA and project student will make them competitive in pursuit of employment not only in academia but also in the computing industry and HPC. In the past, two of our EPSRC-supported researchers have found employment in Accelrys and ICHEC, Dublin. We anticipate that our simulations of the waterwheel and surface hopping atoms will appeal to the imagination of the public and hence there is the clear opportunity for public understanding and engagement. This can be communicated through the Communications Office of QUB, whose remit is to publicise the exciting new discoveries of its researchers. The School of Mathematics and Physics has a programme of lectures to secondary schools and we will use this as a further communication channel to the public and as a way of attracting young people into Mathematics and Physics. How will they benefit? The UK has the potential to take the lead in the exploitation of current-induced forces for the design of nanomotors. Specifically, the action of non-conservative forces has been opened up through our recent research. It is essential to maintain this momentum in order to keep the UK at the forefront and to maximise the opportunities for wealth creation. The quality of life is expected to benefit from the creative design of new nanotechnologies. We encourage our students and PDRAs to take early ownership of their projects and to lead the authoring of publications. Professional skills gained during the project arise from our in-house expertise in atomistic simulation. These will lead to broader applications in fluid dynamics, time-dependent Liouville dynamics and parallel high performance computing. We expect a significant use of graphical visualisation to benefit our student and PDRA as they bring the results before the public. What will be done? The first line of dissemination will be scientific papers, conferences and meetings with collaborators. As mentioned above, we also are planning a workshop aimed at dissemination and exploitation. We have planned a regular programme of visits to our collaborators with whom we are also planning to exchange students, as stated in the letter of support from Prof. Brandbyge. As is stressed in the letter of support from Prof. van Ruitenbeek, the broader interest in electromigration at Leiden will ensure that this theme in the project reaches the relevant community directly. The applicants will seek to identify those parts of the research which may have commercial potential, especially those dealing with molecular-scale motors. The Knowledge and Exploitation Unit at Queen's University will provide advice on protecting intellectual property. Between them, the investigators have experience in presentation and conference authoring, conference organisation and the dissemination of codes through appropriate channels.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>524778</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Copenhagen (K?benhavns Universitet UCPH)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Denmark, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Niels Bohr Institute</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Danish colleagues (Per)</gtr:description><gtr:id>31B27929-54B6-4AC0-9F98-384AED1BFE9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the grant, the following two papers have been published

We aimed to do this through a combination of new research, existing collaborations and the creation of new collaborations. The project has achieved these aims. First, we demonstrated that non-conservative current-driven dynamics can operate and can be very important in structures far beyond the original small numbers of degrees of freedom, and well beyond the nanoscale. These results came hand in hand with the first direct experimental evidence for these effects, from our Leiden collaborators, following - and fostering - a period of close interaction and discussions.

We have furthermore greatly enhanced our links and collaborative work with our colleagues, in theory, in Denmark through the development of a unified methodology for modelling current flow and current-driven atomic motion in nanostructure. This work is embedded in an active and fruitful wider context, as now non-adiabatic electron-nuclear dynamics is rapidly becoming an approach of choice for more and more problems, having till recently been computationally (and methodologically) either difficult or impossible. This intense international context has enabled us to pursue further collaborations, involving also groups in Argentina and the US. It is this international and inter-disciplinary research environment where we see the principal impact of our theoretical and methodological efforts.

From the experimental point of view these links are now opening up the possibility of joint work with our colleagues, on computational tools to describe experimentally accessible systems. A natural focus for this combined effort has again come from the experimental group at Leiden, who initiated an exciting simulation facility - dynamical simulations designed to run in parallel with - and thus directly guide (in real time) - experimental STP manipulation, where now there is much scope for further development of this &amp;quot;Flight Simulator&amp;quot; functionality.

The young researchers employed on this grant have developed a range of highly transferrable skills that are of interest to research and industry alike. This includes High Performance Computing techniques in the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations. Thanks to this training, our PhD student (Brian Cunningham) in this project is now a PDRA on another EPSRC-funded project in our group, entitled &amp;quot;Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW for Next-Generation Electronic Structure&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7AE54B88-7FE5-48DA-8F46-2728B78ABE9C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our project has primarily focussed on three areas.

1. Non-conservative current-driven dynamical effects in long atomic conductors.
 
In our original study of non-conservative current-induced forces a single atom in a bent atomic wire was considered. In that case the effect results from coupling by the current of the 2 d.o.f. of that atom, leading to the visually evocative &amp;quot;waterwheel&amp;quot; motion of that atom. However the principle applies also to multiple general modes of motion in a conductor, opening the question how do non-conservative force do work under these general conditions, and what does the current-driven motion then look like. We were able to show both semi-analytically, and through real-time non-adiabatic non-equilibrium dynamical simulations, that in fact non-conservative dynamical modes of motion develop more easily in longer metallic nanowires, making the &amp;quot;waterwheel effect&amp;quot; the rule, and not the exception, in these important systems. This received an important boost from the recent experimental report of direct evidence for these effects. 
 
2. Understanding and controlling non-conservative effects in multi-terminal systems.

Despite the recent experimental break-through above, experimental detection of non-conservative current-driven dynamical effects remains problematic. In particular, it is difficult to directly and unambiguously compare experiment and theory due to insufficient time resolution in current experimental techniques. One promising area for experimental detection, being pursued by our experimental colleagues in the Netherlands, is the use of 3-terminal STM-based techniques. In this case, we consider adsorbates on a conducting surface and study how they behave as an STM tip is brought in close proximity. During this project we have developed further functionality in our dynamical simulation package (pDINAMO) to allow bias voltages to be applied to multiple terminals in the system. Using this we have been able to model the response of adatoms on conducting surfaces in the presence of a conducting tip. Test studies have shown that a third terminal can have a pronounced effect on the atomic motion, by for instance stabilizing the &amp;quot;waterwheel&amp;quot; orbits.

3. Development of a unified approach for describing conduction in nanostructures.
 
Describing current flow in nanoscale devices requires a range of different effects to be incorporated in a single approach. This includes Joule heating processes, non-conservative forces, electronic friction, andand the Berry-phase forces, discovered by our colleagues in Denmark. To date the approaches used by our group and by our colleagues in Denmark have only been able to address subsets of all the processes involved, at the so-far inevitable cost of leaving out other effects. In conjunction with our Danish colleagues, we have set out a unified approach, based upon a semiclassical Langevin equation for the ions, which can be used to study Joule heating, current-induced forces, and heat transport in molecular conductors. Further work is underway to expand the capability of this theoretical framework further.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work carried out in this project will be taken forward by both academic and non-academic colleagues. We are currently putting together a programme of work with our experimental and theoretical collaborators in the Netherlands and Denmark, with other colleagues in Argentina, and with industrial colleagues in Denmark (Quantumwise), to develop further and combine our methods and techniques for non-adiabatic electron-phonon dynamics as a set of unified modelling tools for &amp;quot;Dynamics for Non-Adiabatic Molecular Applications&amp;quot;. An important aspect of this work will focus on an Experimental &amp;quot;Flight Simulator&amp;quot; - a molecular dynamics package, initiated in Leiden for real-time conducting nano-junction simulations in-sync with experiment, to guide experimental manipulation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CC6C36D0-DB32-4662-9FAA-8AFEA1A4EE5F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This software calculates the non-equilibrium dynamical response matrix for 1D and 2D nanoscale conductors under bias.

During the current grant this piece of software has been updated to describe a nanoscale device connected to several electodes, each of which can be held at differing electrochemical potentials. This code allows new classes of systems to be studies. In particular it allows the response of a device on surface to be probed by an STM tip.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BD83195C-5DDA-4E30-B5A1-AD6A2A992E26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Papers describing this code, together with applications of it, are currently being written up.
