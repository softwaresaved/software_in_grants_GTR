Thus, a rigorous analysis of the 2015 Assembly election will allow us to carefully consider the impact of the 'peace process' and the associated implementation of power-sharing governing structures. We investigate whether power-sharing has actually led to good quality electoral democracy for the people of Northern Ireland or has instead merely cemented and strengthened ethnic divisions. In our investigation, we address a number of specific questions: 

1/ Have the power-sharing institutions maintained or reduced the importance of ethno-national (Protestant British versus Catholic Irish) campaigning and voting at election time? In our study we compare the strength of ethno-national voting over the 1998-2015 period by linking our proposed 2015 study to earlier ESRC funded studies in 1998 and 2003. We assess whether there has been an increase over time in 'cross bloc' voting (Protestants giving lower preference votes to nationalist parties, or Catholics giving lower preference votes to unionist parties). Also, we assess whether the importance of ethno-national ideology (voting on the basis of nationalist versus unionist beliefs) has become more or less important over time. We, furthermore, compare ethno-national ideology to non-conflict ideologies (such as economic left-right views or moral liberal-conservative views). 

2/ Is electoral accountability possible? If there is only one party in government, it is easy for voters to identify who to hold responsible for government performance. In coalition governments it is harder for voters to clearly see which party to blame if things are going badly (or reward if things are going well). This difficulty is particularly acute when all of the parties are in Government and none are in Opposition, as is the case in Northern Ireland. We assess whether it is actually possible for voters to hold decision-makers to account in such a context.
 
3/ Is there an emotional basis to voting? Following on from questions 1 and 2 we assess the conditions under which voters rely on either ethno-national voting or peformance-based voting. We investigate the role of emotions and assess whether anger is associated with voting on the basis of the ethno-national conflict while fear is associated with performance-based voting. 

4/ Does power-sharing discourage participation? Does the absence of a clear Opposition lead to reluctance to engage in politics? Also, does the sense that powersharing benefits one community over the other lead to alienation from politics, or non-electoral forms of political protest?

5/ What are Northern Ireland citizens' attitudes to political reform (such as developing a strong Opposition that would hold the Government to account, or the regulation of sensitive cultural matters such as flag flying and parades)? How do citizens form such attitudes? Why is it that disagreement with suggested reform can spiral into violent street protest?

Answering these questions is important for understanding how democracy operates in the sensitive setting of Northern Ireland. The answers are also important for our broader understanding of how to respond to violent ethnic conflict around the world. The 'Northern Ireland Model' is often held up as an impressive example of successful power-sharing and peace building. Our analysis will provide a detailed critique of the quality of electoral democracy in the Northern Ireland example that will be important for peace builders around the world (including organisations such as the United Nations). We will also maximise the relevance of our work for ordinary citizens in Northern Ireland, second level school teachers and students, Northern Ireland newspapers, documentary makers, and the Northern Ireland Assembly.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our study will influence non-academics in a range of ways. 

BBC Radio 4 documentaries: We plan that our findings will form the basis of two Radio 4 documentaries on the subjects of 1/ Emotions and Politics and 2/ Is Accountability Possible in Politics?

Northern Ireland Newspapers: We have agreed with the leading newspaper political correspondents that we would have their input into the questionnaire design, that we would provide them with data relating to questions they were particularly intersted in and that we would write newspaper articles. 

Electoral Commission: Our findings will inform the Electoral Commission (Northern Ireland) in terms of providing a fuller understanding of the attitudinal as well as demographic precursors to non-participation, and providing a fuller understanding of the ability of citizens to hold the power-sharing government to account at election time.

Community Relations Council: We have discussed the project with the Research Director (Paul Nolan) of the Community Relations Council and our data will be a valuable contribution to the annual Peace Monitoring Reports produced by the Council. 

Northern Ireland Assembly: We plan that our findings will be presented and filmed at a special seminar held in Stormont (part of the QUB/UU/Assembly Seminar Series). This will inform political decision makers about the nature and quality of the citizen-politician link at election time. 

British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly: We will write a report for this Inter-Parliamentary body which brings together representatives from Westminster, D&amp;aacute;il &amp;Eacute;ireann and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Specifically, we will focus on Committee A which addresses 'Sovereign Matters'. 

European Union: We will provide a report for the External Action Service of the European Union. Specifically, we focus on the 'Conflict Prevention, Peace Building and Mediation' sub-division of the 'Security Policy and Conflict Prevention' Directorate.

United Nations: We will provide e United Nations with a report which highlights the particular findings of our study that have most import for the UN's international peace building work. Specifically, we will focus on the Mediation Support Unit in the UN's Department of Political Affairs.

Second level schools and teachers in Northern Ireland: Our findings will be used as a web-based resource for Politics teachers and students in Northern Ireland. Our findings will also inform the annual QUB 6th form lectures for Politics teachers and students. 

Blogs: The applicants have experience contributing to debates in the premier Northern Ireland politics blog, Slugger O'Toole. The findings of our project would be of great interest to the users of the blog. We will also utilise two LSE blogs, particularly for aspects of our study of relevance to a Britain-based audience and an international audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>479232</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Our project has published a range of media articles in Newsweek, The Conversation, The Belfast Telegraph, The Belfast News Letter and various blogs.

I have also appeared on Five Live radio and acted as advisor to the BBC/RTE on an all-island programme on public opinion. 

We have also presented work (presented by the project post-doc) on the gendered nature of Northern Ireland politics at Stormont as part of the Knowledge Exchange Seminar Series (KESS) run by the Northern Ireland Assembly in collaboration with Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University (presentation 9 March 2016)

All of these impacts are detailed on our project website:

Immediately after the May 2017 election we conducted, as promised, our survey of a large sample of Northern Ireland citizens (n over 4000). We asked questions in our survey relating to the EU referendum and we used this data to write a policy briefing paper for Stormont, and we presented this in person in a filmed presentation at Stormont as part of the Knowledge Exchange Seminar Series. http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/research-and-information-service-raise/knowledge-exchange/#outcome
This presentation was on 12th October 2016 and was introduced by Mike Nesbitt, MLA. We conducted and further disseminated analysis of this issue in the Northern Ireland media: http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/brexit-understanding-why-people-voted-as-they-did-in-the-choice-of-a-lifetime-1-7630272 We further disseminated our findings at: http://qpol.qub.ac.uk/public-opinion-challenge-ni/.

As mentioned in the collaborations section, we also sought to maximise the impact of our research by using our data to shed light on how citizens use the Single Transferable Vote electoral system in a divided place such as Northern Ireland. To maximise our impact on this we collaborated with the Electoral Reform Society and published a report that attracted lots of media attention in soft copy form. Our hard copy launch is at a specially organised event on 23 March in Belfast city as part of International Democracy Day.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>575E9A85-273F-40FA-87DC-E8D1300692DC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>PLEASE NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS STILL LIVE AND WAS GIVEN A 6 MONTH NO COST EXTENTION SUCH THAT IT WILL FORMALLY END IN END OF AUGUST 2017. THIS IS TO FACILITATE FURTHER DATA COLLECTION PERTAINING TO THE 2017 ELECTION

1/ We conducted a survey of a representative sample of 1000 Northern Ireland respondents and asked them open ended questions about what they thought each of the political parties stood for. We found that the ethno-national theme was by a long way the most dominant of the substantive themes mentioned (compared to other themes such as social class and socio-moral beliefs). However, the ethno-national theme was still a 'minority' response overall (42%) as large numbers of respondents indicated that they did not know what any of the parties stood for. Within the ethno-national theme it was ideas (relating to to nationalism or unionism) that were most important (compared to 'groups' such as Catholics or Protestants'.

2/ We have discovered that providing (in the form of Voter Advice Applications) citizens with information about the policy beliefs of the parties has an effect on how they are likely to vote. Specifically, more information leads to citizens being less hostile to parties from the outgroup (i.e. more information makes Catholics somewhat more positive about the unionist parties, and more information makes Protestants somewhat more positive about nationalist parties). 

3/ We have found that there are three underling dimensions of competition in Northern Ireland. While the ethno-national dimension may be by far the strongest we find that citizens beliefs do cluster together in such a way that there is a socio-moral dimension (on issues relating to gay rights and abortions and related issues) and also a social class dimension (taxation, welfare and suchlike). 

4/ We have studied the bases of voting in the EU referendum in Northern Ireland. In our analysis which the PI presented to policy makers at Stormont, we found a very strong ethno-national basis to voting: namely, Protestants were strongly in favour of leaving the EU and Catholics were very strongly in favour of remaining in the EU. Further we found some evidence of a class basis to voting: working class and lower educated citizens were more likely to want to leave the EU and middle class and more highly educated citizens were more likely to want to remain. Importantly, however, this class distinction only works strongly within Protestants. As far as Catholics are concerned, almost all Catholics, irrespective of class and education level wish to remain in the EU. 

5/ In collaboration with the Electoral Reform Society, we have studied in depth how voters in Northern Ireland use the Single Transferable Vote electoral system. We found that voting 'across the divide' is rare: i.e. very few Catholics vote for Unionist parties and very few Protestants vote for Nationalist parties. However, we find that voters use the system very similarly to voters in other STV polities: i.e. they typically rank the same number of candidates (3 on average). Also we found that lower preference voting varies across community. Protestants were much more likely to transfer to the SDLP than to Sinn Fein whereas Catholics were almost equally likely to transfer to the UUP and the DUP. What this means is that how citizens view the parties of the 'other community' varies a lot: Catholics see the 'other' parties as very similar whereas Protestants see the 'other parties' as very different from each other.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have coded the manifestos of all the main five parties from 1998 to 2016. To do this we developed and tested a coding frame specifically designed for deeply divided places. We suggest that other scholars interested in systematically assessing political parties ideological positions in divided places can apply our coding frame. 

Our analysis of our Voter Advice Applications paves the way for other scholars to develop our experimental work and further assess how information provision effects citizens. Our work was one of the first interventionist field experiments in this area and our methodology is of potentially widespread application in any democratic setting. 

Our analysis of vote transfer behaviour may be used by other researchers in STV systems to systematically understand the details of how voters use the ballot paper.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6946DF20-8999-4B37-AC50-1B011B73D798</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/NIAES2016/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0920F1A1-F102-4527-B8BD-BE5656FE243F"><gtr:id>0920F1A1-F102-4527-B8BD-BE5656FE243F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dimensionality of Policy Space in Consociational Northern Ireland</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Political Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/38f15b1cc76806c02c261d275e0a6a82"><gtr:id>38f15b1cc76806c02c261d275e0a6a82</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Garry J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0AC21F51-FE19-427B-9DDD-1ABDA9FCF702"><gtr:id>0AC21F51-FE19-427B-9DDD-1ABDA9FCF702</gtr:id><gtr:title>Plus &amp;Ccedil;a Change: The 2014 Local Elections in Northern Ireland</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Irish Political Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/45720e5a75ed789d4cf2dd80a43c788c"><gtr:id>45720e5a75ed789d4cf2dd80a43c788c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Matthews N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L005808/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B64449A8-2468-4FB4-A7C4-D0D95891E5B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Elections/Electoral studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
