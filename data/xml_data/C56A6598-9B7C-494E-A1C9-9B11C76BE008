A unique mixture of domestic and external factors have combined to form sources of persistent instability. The Mediterranean countries have traditionally been extremely diverse in political, economic and social terms. Here, the three great religions of the World meet, developed nations co-exist with the developing, democratic forms of governance with authoritarianism, the secular with the theocratic, stability with instability, tolerance with fanaticism. Parts of the region are recruitment grounds for international terrorism. The continued volatility of the Mediterranean region and its importance to European and Western security make it imperative that the post WWII experience of the whole of the region is studied from a historical perspective. Such a project is not only timely but also essential as it will promote a clearer understanding of the region, its dynamics and its potential for both conflict and conflict resolution.\n\nThis project will investigate the impact of superpower competition on the Mediterranean region during the Cold War and its effects in the immediate post-Cold War period. In more detail, it will identify and investigate the sources of volatility in the Mediterranean. It will examine the patterns of relations established by the Mediterranean countries with the superpowers during the Cold War and will map out the emergence of the US as the hegemonic power in the region. It will attempt to answer the questions of how far during the Cold War, the presence of the two superpowers in the region contributed to its instability and further fragmentation and, in contrast, to what extent, by their presence, the superpowers succeeded in containing some of the most deep-seated and pernicious sources of conflict. The project will examine the impact of international institutions in furthering fragmentation of the region. It will look at how regional powers pressured the superpowers into promoting their national interests under the veneer of the Cold War rhetoric. It will also try to evaluate how much the Cold War is still casting its shadow over the region, especially with regard to the issues of heavy militarisation; armaments proliferation; fragmentation; environmental degradation; instability and conflict. Finally, the impact of an America 'unbound' will be considered.\n\nThe project regards the Mediterranean World as a terrain united by a sea but divided by continent, political traditions, economic development, religion and culture. The term 'Mediterranean' will be used to describe both the EU and non-EU Mediterranean countries thus diverging from the Euro-Mediterranean Process (EMP) terminology that employs the term Mediterranean only in relation to the non-EU countries of the Southern Mediterranean.\n\nThe aim of the project is to integrate primary sources with existing historiography to produce a book that will deepen understanding of the dynamics created by the Cold War and how these have coalesced into perpetuating volatility in the Mediterranean region in the post Cold War World.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22262</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E000827/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
