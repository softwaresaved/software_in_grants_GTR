systems</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/I012419/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Scarcity of water has been identified as the most serious environmental threat facing the health and security of people living in the tropics. Pressures on water supply undermine stability through stresses on food availability and spread of disease e.g., malaria and meningitis. Yet predictions of precipitation show very high uncertainty in the Tropics and especially the arid climatic zones such as sub-Saharan Africa where the vulnerability of the population is amongst the highest in the world. The outlook for Sahel precipitation in coupled simulations of the twenty-first century remains very uncertain with no consensus as to whether there will be more or less rain in the future, or how the frequency and intensity of high impact weather will change. Skillful forecasts of rainfall would be of enormous benefit across all timescales ranging from hours to decades. In particular, short-range forecasts (up to 2 days) for the public and aviation industry, and medium-range forecasts (10-30 days) for agriculture, hydrology and health information. This is challenging since rainfall is organised through a complex interplay of large-scale wave patterns, weather systems and isolated deep convective updrafts. The locations of individual convective updrafts are not predictable and even the occurrence and evolution of mesoscale weather systems are poorly represented in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. However, there is some hope for greater predictability since the pattern of active and inactive regions of convection is often determined by large-scale wave structure. Examples of such phenomena include African Easterly Waves (AEWs) and equatorial waves. Owing to the waves, there is potential predictability for high impact weather events occurring simultaneously in several locations at once. For example, if several storms are spawned within a large-scale wave, each one of them could present a significant natural hazard, with safety and financial implications (such correlated events are not accounted for in the risk models used by the insurance industry). Unfortunately, there are severe deficiencies in the simulation of tropical large-scale waves which typically decay far too quickly in forecasts and propagate too slowly. However, it is difficult to amend models to improve the simulation of large-scale tropical waves because underpinning theory for tropical waves is currently too weak to unpick the problem. It is necessary to formulate better how different processes influence wave evolution so that modifications can be aimed at improving wave representation. The aim of the proposed project is to develop the theory behind large-scale waves in the tropics to the level where it can be applied in the quantitative diagnosis of observed weather systems. In doing so we aim to identify the processes that are most important in wave initiation, maintenance and propagation, and ways in which they are misrepresented in models, with a view to improving weather forecasts. The research will study the interplay between large-scale waves and convective rainfall through three stages of complexity: A) the dynamics of waves assuming small amplitude, B) large-amplitude aspects including vacillations between jet strength and wave amplitude, and C) explaining deficiencies in state-of-the-art forecasts of tropical waves using the new theory developed. The anticipated benefit of the research is improvement in weather forecasts of rainfall throughout the tropics at lead times of a day to a season. Stage C will be advanced through collaboration with project partners from two world-leading operational forecast centres: the Met Office and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>344277</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>African Risk Capacity</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>African Risk Capacity</gtr:description><gtr:id>FE260A10-50F9-478C-B07B-A70D79B6F75A</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Multi-lateral collaboration</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Meteorological Office UK</gtr:department><gtr:description>Met Office</gtr:description><gtr:id>5721C55A-7DA8-43D9-A961-793AC3F938C8</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Sean Milton, the head of the global model evaluation group of the Met Office is a project partner.

Two tropical wave phenomena have been the centre of attention: equatorial waves (propagating around the tropics, especially across the oceans) and African Easterly Waves which develop primarily across West Africa and across the North Atlantic Ocean. Variability in rainfall across the tropical oceans and West Africa is dominated by the occurrence and properties of these waves. However, in the weather forecasts produced by numerical models, these waves decay rapidly and also do not propagate at the correct speeds. The net result is that weather forecasts for the tropics (up to weekly timescales) have very little skill. The chief exception is the longer range skill associated with the slowly propagating Madden Julian Oscillation, but this has not been the focus of this project.

The basic theories of equatorial and African Easterly Waves are derived for a dry atmosphere, not accounting for the influence of water (vapour, liquid and ice) and latent heating associated with changes in phase. Furthermore, equatorial wave theory assumes a resting atmosphere, while it is known that horizontal and vertical shear in the background zonal flow is a major influence on wave structure and development. This project has conducted new research to shed light on the role of moisture and shear in tropical wave dynamics and the precipitation embedded within them.

A new design of experiment using the Met Office Unified Model has demonstrated the effects that the entrainment of moisture into convection embedded within waves has on their intensity and propagation speed. It has been shown that the variation of humidity in phase with the wave is essential to coherent wave existence. If the moisture entrained is artificially made uniform (as seen by convection in the model) the relationship between convection and the waves is lost and convection exhibits self-aggregating behaviour typically of an environment without contrasts. A new local energetics framework has shown how the influence of disturbances in the subtropics excites tropical waves in the presence of a shear flow, while the heating within the waves acts to damp wave activity. So although the humidity variation is crucial to propagation and the coherent organisation of rainfall and weather systems, it acts to reduce the amplitude of wave energy. Research is ongoing to connect these findings to the observed deficiencies in operational weather forecasts in the tropics.

Work on African Easterly Waves has revealed the typical relationships between wave &amp;quot;troughs&amp;quot; and the location of deep convection (with its attendant thunderstorms, heavy precipitation and squall lines). It has been found that most climate models do not represent the composite structures captured in meteorological analyses. The tracks of African Easterly Wave centres are found to differ markedly between models and even between analyses because the observational constraint over Africa is weak due to paucity of data. We have also investigated the relationships between AEWs and equatorial waves and shown that the horizontal structure of AEWs projects strongly onto Rossby wave modes with eastward tilt in height expected for the baroclinic growth mechanism. This therefore links theory with the observed wave evolution. Current investigation is focusing on the interactions between different equatorial wave types and AEWs which appear to be enabled by the shear of the African Easterly Jet.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is too early to say until we have completed the research. However, global numerical weather prediction centres (our project partners the Met Office and ECMWF) are likely to be the most immediate beneficiaries since the research points to the way in which convection and dynamics interact within large-scale waves and the sensitivity to the representation of those processes. The work on African Easterly Wave climatologies in climate models and analyses is very relevant to the robustness of climate change projections for the region and planning resilient societies and adaptation to climate change.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0DBE7B9C-E576-424F-8534-09153A40D47E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Developed new diagnostics which analyse the nature of Madden-Julian Oscillation propagation, for comparison with observations.
