Cluster algebras is a very recent notion introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002. Soon after that, it turned out that cluster algebras are connected to many other fields in mathematics, such as combinatorics of polytopes, representation theory, Poisson geometry, Teichmuller theory, integrable systems. These connections brought together researchers from many different branches of mathematics and mathematical physics, which induced amazingly rapid growth both of the theory of cluster algebras and of related fields.

It was known since introduction of cluster algebras that some cluster algebras are connected to some Coxeter groups. More precisely, finite cluster algebras (the only ones which are finitely generated) are enumerated by finite crystallographic Coxeter groups. 

The first aim of this proposal is to push this correspondence further to the next complexity class of cluster algebras (called cluster algebras of finite mutation type and including a large class of cluster algebras arising from triangulated boardered surfaces). Algebras from this class should correspond to certain quotients of Coxeter group. For algebras arising from surfaces, the relations in the constructed group should correspond to certain paths on the surface.

There are many natural questions arising once the correspondence between algebras and groups constructed. In particular, it is interesting to know if some of the groups constructed as quotients of Coxeter groups are Coxeter groups themselves? Can the constructed group be finite if the cluster algebra is not a finite one? Do different algebras induce different groups? How the obtained group is connected to the initial surface, in the case of a surface algebra?

As one of the applications of the theory, we will construct finite volume hyperbolic manifolds with large symmetry groups.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact will be mostly academic, as the proposal is primary aimed for the progress of mathematical knowledge. It develops and connects the fields which already lie in the area of strength in the UK, namely in algebra and geometry (more precisely, there is a number of world leading schools working in UK on topics closely related to the project). This should lead to further advancement in these areas.

It is hard to foresee any direct economical or social impact in a short period, however the relation of the proposed research with different parts of mathematics and especially with theoretical physics will probably lead to further development of these areas, which in its turn may induce further progress in technology. As an example of a shortcut between our research area and technology, one can take a series of applications of cluster algebras to electrical networks.

To speed up this multistage process, we will work on wide disseminating of our results, including communications with different parts of mathematical community, establishing more contacts with mathematical physicists as well as giving public lectures to disseminate the core ideas outside mathematical community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>180115</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Cluster algebra from infinite surfaces (in progress)
