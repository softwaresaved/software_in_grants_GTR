This will build on the Fama-French and Momentum portfolios and factors for the UK market established by Gregory, Tharyan and Huang (2009).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our first objective is to expand this dataset to include the full range of portfolios available for the US. Second, we will expand the available factor and portfolio data to encompass ongoing developments in literature relating to returns and asset pricing. Third, we will undertake a comprehensive range of asset pricing model tests to develop a more convincing model of the cross-section of UK stock returns. Lastly we will develop the UK literature on implied cost of capital (ICC). With reference to the latter, we will both test alternative models of ICC and examine the role of implied, rather than realised, returns in asset pricing tests.&lt;/p>
&amp;nbsp;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As we note, the twin aims of this research project are to first to investigate cost of capital and asset pricing in the UK and second to facilitate the creation and maintenance of high quality, survivorship bias free, standardised and regularly updated set of specific financial data. This will be for the free use of academics, researchers (including PhD students) and should also be of use to regulatory bodies such as the Competition Commission, OFT, OFWAT, OFCOM and other regulators. We already know that the original data behind this project has been used in a recent Competition Commission appeal case (Bristol Water) and a letter of interest from the CC is attached to this proposal.

In helping to advance the state of knowledge of asset pricing in the UK, our project will be of value to UK companies and regulators in establishing expected cost of capital and the market risk premium. Besides helping the corporate sector understand what factors influence their cost of capital, knowledge of the asset pricing process helps regulatory authorities both in setting utility prices and conducting profitability tests, used in market investigations. At present, those authorities rely exclusively on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, despite its known limitations. Through the use of different estimation periods for beta, different test periods, and implied cost of capital estimates, we intend to carry out more rigorous testing of the CAPM. We will also test the CAPM against alternative models of asset pricing in order to assess whether regulators and the corporate sector would be best advised to abandon the CAPM in favour of an alternative model.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>285111</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Important implications for profitability analysis in regulation, and all regulated UK utilities</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8281E1C7-B758-4978-AAE3-1DC6B5C1148E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This is project is ongoing. We have so far established monthly and daily portfolios and factors for UK asset pricing models at the link below: http://business-school.exeter.ac.uk/research/areas/centres/xfi/research/famafrench/

In addition, we have a paper with important implications for impact, to be presented at BAFA 2016. The paper has been submitted to a prestiguous journal and is in the second round of revisions. The paper looks at the improtant issue of &amp;quot;market beta&amp;quot; estiamtion using high frequency versus low frequency data. The estiamtion of &amp;quot;market beta&amp;quot; is an important issue for many regulatory bodies in the UK (and in otherjurisdictions). This paper contributes to the less than extensive literature on the determinants of the differences when using different frequencies of data. A key finding is that lower frequency data (monthly) may be prefereable when computing &amp;quot;market betas&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This is ongoing work.
