&lt;p>The current research will systematically test a non-leading closed-question technique that requires respondents to provide answers at different levels of detail (or 'grain size'). This novel technique is designed to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>increase the quantity of information eyewitnesses report and 
&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>evaluate the accuracy of reported information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This approach is based on psychological theory on the strategic control of memory reporting, and recent research on the relationship between metacognitive judgments of confidence and accuracy. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This programme of research will be conducted in the UK and Australia by combining the efforts of research groups with distinct approaches to enhancing eyewitness recall. In a series of controlled experiments, the researchers will examine the performance of the grain size interview, focusing on confidence, retention interval, and capacity to preserve information over time.&amp;nbsp; Experiments will also consider the ability of the grain size interview to differentiate between repeated events and protect against misleading post-event information.&lt;/p>

Laboratory testing, cross-laboratory validation, and systematic adaptation are only the very first steps in a long and slow process of application to real-world contexts. Although still in the early stages, the current research has extended the range of empirically tested techniques available to professional investigators. In brief, we successfully tested a novel procedure for eliciting information from witnesses and devised innovative instructions for extracting significantly more coarse grain details. To secure applied impact, we have prepared a Research Briefing Note for practitioners to disseminate our initial findings. This briefing has been circulated to forces we collaborate with closely (Greater Manchester Police, Metropolitan Police). Circulating information about new techniques enables us to respond to practitioner feedback before progressing with further laboratory testing.

A second important impact is that as a result of recent investigative interviewing research (including the current project) the UK PI and CI have been appointed as Visiting Researchers in conjunction with Interview Advisors (Major Incident Team) at Greater Manchester Police. These appointments represent a significant opportunity to secure the impact of our research in future. Furthermore, all members of the research team present regularly to professional development meetings of judges, magistrates, police and lawyers on the topic of eyewitness evidence and incorporate these research findings in such sessions. 
The current research represents the early stage proof-of-concept testing of a novel approach to questioning. In terms of preliminary knowledge exchange, the Research Briefing Note provides practitioners with (i) an overview of the practical problem; (ii) a summary of recent psychological theory which might inform potential solutions;(iii) a summary of the findings and (iv) tentative suggestions as to how both the research might inform good investigative interviewing practice. Although the document is freely available via our website for any interested parties, we have only circulated it directly to interview specialists and investigators with whom we have close working relationships at UK forces. At this early stage, these knowledge-transfer activities need to proceed carefully given the nature of the topic. The notion of closed questions is somewhat antithetical to current practice (largely due to misuse) - therefore, it will be important to ensure that potential users of the novel technique are fully briefed. We have already begun work on this by introducing terms to reflect some important distinctions (e.g. fine-grain, coarse-grain, meta-cognition) during practitioner-oriented dissemination activities to date.

In the academic domain, the results of the research have been of interest to two largely independent groups of researchers; (a) those with an interest in metacognition and the role of metacognitive markers (such as confidence) on memorial output and (b) those with a more applied interest in investigative interviewing. Numerous research projects undertaken since the completion of the funding period have been informed by experimental designs, stimuli and methodologies devised in the course of the research programme across all three laboratories (PI Hope, CI Gabbert, &amp;amp; CI Brewer), including the work of several PhD students. We expect the lines of research opened in the course of the research programme to continue to develop and extend the impact of the original work.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0EAA553C-6470-4281-B875-96F0518977B4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overarching aim of the research programme was to produce a novel approach to optimising eyewitness recall grounded in recent theory-driven advances in memory and metacognitive research. Specifically, we sought to develop a technique to (a) increase the quantity of information reported and (b) facilitate the use of diagnostic measures (such as confidence) to evaluate accuracy. All key objectives have been met and, indeed, exceeded. Our work has achieved a number of important scientific impacts. Firstly, drawing on Koriat and Goldsmith's (1996) model of strategic monitoring and control, we have, across five studies in the UK and five studies in Australia, produced a novel closed (non-leading) question approach that not only elicits significantly more information from witnesses than free recall or a form of the Cognitive Interview but also facilitates the use of their metacognitive assessments to diagnose the accuracy of information provided. Secondly, experiments have examined the impact of variables including delay to interview, repeated interviews, exposure to misinformation and response option on output. Thirdly, we have developed an instruction set that produces significantly more coarse grain information without a concomitant cost to accuracy. Specifically, we have identified a way of eliciting information from witnesses that is (a) often forensically relevant and (b) not reported in the traditional open interviewing formats. In terms of scientific impact these findings, adopting methodological innovations, advance empirical understanding of witness memory reporting and have generated new lines of research including an exploration of variables contributing to witnesses' reluctance to report coarse grained information.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In summary, our work has potential for use in the following non-academic contexts:

Policy-Makers/Police Practitioners: Although it is somewhat early to have achieved significant impact at this level at this stage of a new development, there have been positive signs and certainly the work has informed more recent research on policy issues (e.g. Hope et al., under review).

Furthermore, we anticipate greater impact over the next few years when both projects have completed and the refereed journal publications emerge from the research.

Societal Level: Obtaining good quality, reliable evidence is vital for the investigation process, the pursuit of justice, and preventing miscarriages of justice. High quality psychology research can make a significant contribution to the quality and range of empirically-based techniques available to investigators. By working closely with investigative practitioners, we have been able to identify deficits in current tools and techniques and then devise and test novel alternative solutions based on robust memory theory. Evidence-based techniques serve to improve the evidence and experience of witnesses and victims. Close collaboration between the police and researchers supports the work of the criminal justice system.

Other End-Users: Investigators in other settings (e.g. health and safety, industrial investigations) may, in due course, come to benefit from the techniques initiated in the current research.

We expect to continue our work on the Grain-Size procedure to continue for several years to come as opportunities for use and future development of the technique continue to present themselves. Although still in the early stages, the current research has extended the range of empirically tested techniques available to professional investigators. In brief, we successfully tested a novel procedure for eliciting information from witnesses and devised innovative instructions for extracting significantly more coarse grain details (see End of Award Report). To secure applied impact, we have prepared a Research Briefing Note for practitioners to disseminate our initial findings (see Research Catalogue). This briefing has been circulated to forces we collaborate with closely (Greater Manchester Police, Metropolitan Police). Circulating information about new techniques at this early stage will enable us to respond to practitioner feedback before progressing with further laboratory testing.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>388BC09D-12D1-4E75-80D4-040DBE3BA56D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.selfadministeredinterview.com/news/research-briefing-about-initial-findings-from-new-interview-project/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9693C2EC-C2B3-4DE8-AD00-9815C0BC50EC"><gtr:id>9693C2EC-C2B3-4DE8-AD00-9815C0BC50EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Increasing output quantity and diagnosing accuracy using the Grain Size technique.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/74682085ad8098d3f88529203979e6c1"><gtr:id>74682085ad8098d3f88529203979e6c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hope, L.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C0ACA9C6-4211-4788-ADE1-2271EB4FD57E"><gtr:id>C0ACA9C6-4211-4788-ADE1-2271EB4FD57E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Memory and the operational witness: Police officer recall of firearms encounters as a function of active response role.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Law and human behavior</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/603e786fc016ec470243028e3207e1fe"><gtr:id>603e786fc016ec470243028e3207e1fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hope L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0147-7307</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B8CD312F-2B91-413D-99BA-482EE3BDE18E"><gtr:id>B8CD312F-2B91-413D-99BA-482EE3BDE18E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Improving eyewitness output: The regulation of remembering during investigative interviews.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/603e786fc016ec470243028e3207e1fe"><gtr:id>603e786fc016ec470243028e3207e1fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hope L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/09C0B5CF-8DAF-4EA2-B7E8-5F6E5074576F"><gtr:id>09C0B5CF-8DAF-4EA2-B7E8-5F6E5074576F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigative Interviewing Research Briefing Note (Research Briefing for Practitioners)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/74682085ad8098d3f88529203979e6c1"><gtr:id>74682085ad8098d3f88529203979e6c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hope, L.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CB7AA7A0-92A9-4F54-B5B2-56928117F132"><gtr:id>CB7AA7A0-92A9-4F54-B5B2-56928117F132</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interviewing eyewitnesses : enhancing outputs by controlling the grain size of reports</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1bf33fab311e188886993d94c400459d"><gtr:id>1bf33fab311e188886993d94c400459d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brewer, N.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/378D6EEA-DA45-42E2-BE1B-8110597217ED"><gtr:id>378D6EEA-DA45-42E2-BE1B-8110597217ED</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regulating Memory: Increasing output quantity and diagnosing accuracy with a Grain Size approach</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/603e786fc016ec470243028e3207e1fe"><gtr:id>603e786fc016ec470243028e3207e1fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hope L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7F9CCB27-DF91-4791-AEB8-BF8270CC93AD"><gtr:id>7F9CCB27-DF91-4791-AEB8-BF8270CC93AD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is regulation of accuracy necessary in memory reporting?
