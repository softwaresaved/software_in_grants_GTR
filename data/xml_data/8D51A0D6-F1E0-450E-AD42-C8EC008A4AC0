We have discovered that human CRP can make such injury worse and have demonstrated it in animal models of heart attack and stroke. There is compelling clinical evidence that CRP has the same damaging effect in human diseases and that its inhibition will make a major contribution to management of a wide range of conditions. We therefore designed a family of new small molecule drugs, called bis(phosphocholine)-alkanes, which inhibit the adverse effects of CRP and are efficacious in animal models. We now propose to develop the optimal drug, bis(phosphocholine) octane, for clinical testing. The required development steps, for which funding is sought, are pharmaceutical manufacture of the drug, pre-clinical testing, toxicology and formulation to comply with regulatory requirements, and first into man studies, in healthy adult volunteers. This programme will provide a medicine which complies with the ethical and regulatory requirements for clinical testing in patients admitted to hospital with a first heart attack who are receiving all other state of the art treatment. We have detailed plans for this trial but do not seek funding for it now. The rigorous regulation of drug development means that the work now needed cannot be conducted in academic institutions but only in pharmaceutical companies or contract research organisations, which specialise in drug manufacture and testing. We shall therefore outsource to selected commercial companies, the production, pre-clinical testing and first into man studies of the drug. Success will critically depend on using the best companies and on very effective project management. We are fortunate that one of the co-applicants, Dr Chris Swain, has a long track record of successful experience in drug development in industry and as an independent consultant. He will be supported throughout by other external consultants specialised in each of the different development tasks, through the services of Advocates Ltd, a leading consultancy firm in this field which advises UCL Business PLC, the technology transfer arm of UCL. Several large pharmaceutical companies and also some investors in pharma company creation are very keen to see our initial clinical results. Positive findings leading to prompt commercialisation and a licensed new medicine will culminate 40 years of continuous MRC support for the research of Professor Pepys, the lead applicant.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to develop the C-reactive protein (CRP) inhibitor drug, bis(phosphocholine)-octane (1,8-bis[{[(trimethylammonium)ethoxy]phosphinyl}-oxy]octane), BPC8, to enable a first phase IIa proof of concept study in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention. BPC8 is an optimised version of bis(phosphocholine) hexane (BPC6), the first CRP inhibitor drug. We designed this new small molecule chemical entity and showed that it is well tolerated and efficacious in animals. CRP is the classical human acute phase protein, the circulating concentration of which rises from normal values of 1 mg/l to as much as 500 mg/l in the major acute phase responses associated with most serious infections, inflammatory and tissue damaging disorders. CRP binds to ligands exposed on damaged and dead cells, and then activates complement. The powerful chemotactic, opsonic, cytolytic, pro inflammatory and tissue damaging effects of complement kill cells which would otherwise have survived the primary pathology. We have demonstrated that human CRP significantly exacerbates ischaemic tissue damage via a complement dependent mechanism in rat models of acute myocardial infarction, cardiac ischaemia reperfusion injury and ischaemic stroke. BPC6 completely abrogates this pathogenic effect of human CRP and BPC8 will be even more potent. Compelling observational and epidemiological evidence is consistent with a pathogenic role of CRP after human acute myocardial infarction and high acute phase CRP concentrations are also likely to contribute to tissue damage in a wide variety of other traumatic, inflammatory, infective and neoplastic conditions. Targeting human CRP is therefore a valid therapeutic strategy and our patents covering CRP as a target for phosphocholine drugs and our novel bis(phosphocholine) alkane compounds themselves have been granted or are in condition for allowance. Our work on CRP has received continuous MRC Programme Grant funding since 1975 enabling our many contributions, including establishing the universal use of CRP as a clinical analyte, producing the WHO International Reference Standard for CRP Immunoassay (84/506), and solving the 3D structure of CRP alone and in combination with small molecule ligands. Combined with our comprehensive expertise in CRP, the development programme will be managed by Dr Chris Swain, Cambridge MedChem Consulting, who during his long career at Merck led pre-clinical development of the novel NK1 antagonist drug, Emend, through to commercialisation. Supporting consultancy throughout the CMC, pre clinical, regulatory and clinical programmes will be provided by the firm of Advocates Ltd.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4007260</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Scinovo</gtr:department><gtr:description>Inhibition of C-reactive protein (CRP) for treatment of cardiovascular and inflammatory disease</gtr:description><gtr:id>66B6DCC9-5747-4049-AB5F-461D2BE643FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is making a huge contribution to the progress of the programme.

Scinovo has access to scientific experts within GSK who have a proven track record of bringing compounds from discovery through to launch across the entire Research and Development continuum. Additionally Scinovo has deep and broad experience in working concurrently with regulatory bodies and participating in industry and governmental groups.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Prof Sir Mark Pepys and his team have shown that human CRP, the classical acute phase plasma protein which increases greatly in concentration in response to most forms of tissue damage, infection and inflammation, can exacerbate pre-existing tissue injury by binding to the damaged cells, activating complement and thus provoking additional inflammation. In particular in ischaemic injury to the heart and brain, in heart attacks and strokes respectively, CRP is likely to make a significant contribution to the eventual scale of the damage. Inhibition of CRP binding is thus a valid therapeutic target and Sir Mark and his group have designed and continue to design, novel CRP inhibitor compounds, with the aim of developing one or more for clinical testing and eventual adoption as a new drug. The Medical Research Council awarded &amp;pound;3.84 million to Sir Mark in 2010, as the first grant given under their new Developmental Clinical Studies scheme, to support development of a CRP inhibitor molecule up to and including human phase I studies. Sir Mark and his team contribute extensive knowledge of CRP and CRP binding ligands as well as the funding awarded to Sir Mark by the MRC. Most of the development programme is outsourced to CROs but Sir Mark's group provide practical laboratory support via specialist in vitro assays and in vivo models.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London (UCL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Investigation of CRP-ligand interactions by NMR</gtr:description><gtr:id>62061B37-E5BC-45A8-9746-FECFAB33BB7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/a as still very early</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner and his group will undertake these high resolution NMR studies using our materials in order to gain new insights into the factors controlling CRP-ligand and CRP-CRP interactions.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our work has centred on the development of palindrominic ligands as inhibitors of CRP binding to damaged and dead cells in order to prevent the exacerbation of CRP-mediated complement activation and subsequent tissue injury.

Novel CRP inhibitor compounds are currently in pre-clinical development. After extensive evaluation the original compound, BPC8, for the development of which the DCS award was given in 2010, was found not be optimal for further development. In 2012 the MRC awarded Sir Mark additional funds for a back up chemistry programme to rationally design and synthesise new candidate molecules drawing on the results so far with BPC8. This programme continues and two promising candidate molecules are currently being synthesised by a CRO. In a progress report to the MRC Sir Mark described the novel molecules which have been designed, synthesised and tested so far. Unsurprisingly for such a novel programme none evaluated so far have been optimal for development, however the results of these evaluations have provided important knowledge for the design of subsequent compounds. Two promising compounds are currently being synthesised by a CRO and are due for delivery early November. Unfortunately the MRC have deemed the programme to now be too different from the original plan and have decided to terminate the award. A termination plan has been submitted and we await approval. In the meantime evaluation of the newest compounds will continue with a view to seeking further funds if one or more of these should prove worthy of full scale pre-clinical evaluation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>314709C1-6CD2-41AF-AA45-0D2A1EA1AD72</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The work was published in Nature in 2006 and was the subject of the cover illustration and additional material in the journal.

Sir Mark's group also collaborated closely with GSK's scientific advisory arm, Scinovo, on his CRP inhibitor molecule programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:url>http://pentraxin.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2004</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0D4ACC7A-4867-4A17-9E5D-E6EBAEA70664"><gtr:id>0D4ACC7A-4867-4A17-9E5D-E6EBAEA70664</gtr:id><gtr:title>C-reactive protein is essential for innate resistance to pneumococcal infection.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e722caed5ab755cbbee8a96491d55440"><gtr:id>e722caed5ab755cbbee8a96491d55440</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Simons JP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0019-2805</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1270C9E0-2780-4B5F-8840-5BC0DA5BC315"><gtr:id>1270C9E0-2780-4B5F-8840-5BC0DA5BC315</gtr:id><gtr:title>Attention to detail in the selection of words in epidemiologic research reports.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of epidemiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a83695b7c5b808a74aaf984a221dd067"><gtr:id>a83695b7c5b808a74aaf984a221dd067</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Greenland P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-9262</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A1D9CFC8-C023-4F58-A84B-5B816FC4D194"><gtr:id>A1D9CFC8-C023-4F58-A84B-5B816FC4D194</gtr:id><gtr:title>Infusion of pharmaceutical-grade natural human C-reactive protein is not proinflammatory in healthy adult human volunteers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Circulation research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4046104e97e204569804a7efefb178f2"><gtr:id>4046104e97e204569804a7efefb178f2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lane T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0009-7330</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G1000612</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
