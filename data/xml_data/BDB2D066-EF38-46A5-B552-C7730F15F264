Malaysia is an important place to study these issues, since it has one of the highest rates of undocumented workers in the world, yet the daily experiences of these workers and their families are unexamined in the literature.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will produce detailed qualitative data on the mobile, urban lives of undocumented children, and will contribute to theoretical and methodological scholarship on the role of children in long-term processes of migration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research aims to generate a new theoretical framework for understanding children?s experiences of ?illegality?, which will be of interest not only to academic researchers but also to NGOs and UN bodies focused on migrant, refugee and child rights.The project?s findings will be communicated in briefing papers, scholarly articles and a book, but also through a website of children?s images and stories.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will be of direct benefit to both international and Malaysia-based NGOs and charities, to UN bodies and to the general public.

In Malaysia, NGOs that will benefit from this research include:
- 'Voice of the Children', a child advocacy group with a developing interest in stateless children in Sabah
- 'Humana Child Aid Society', a charity providing basic education to the children of migrant workers on plantations in rural Sabah
- 'Tenaganita', who campaign for migrant, refugee and women's rights and who have previously organised a conference on the rights of migrant children in Sabah
- SUARAM, who campaign for the promotion and protection of human rights in Malaysia
- SUKA Society Malaysia, a children's NGO providing support programs to children at risk

Other regional NGOs and campaign networks that will benefit include:
- CARAM Asia, a regional network campaigning on migration and health issues
- Migrant CARE, an Indonesian association for migrant workers' sovereignty
- Migrante International, an international alliance of Filipino migrant organizations

The research will also benefit international organizations including:
- Refugees International, an advocacy organisation which campaigns for refugee rights and researches the impact of statelessness
- UNICEF, who have recently helped launch a school for the children of Filipino migrants
- UNHCR, who continue to classify Filipino refugees in Sabah as 'people of concern'
- International Crisis Group, the Asia Program of which is concerned to reduce conflicts associated with migration

All of these organisations will benefit from detailed research (communicated in part through briefing papers) about the contemporary living conditions and experiences of migrants in KK, and the specific consequences for children of their parents' migrations. My findings are likely to have an instrumental impact on the campaign strategies and provision of support and help by Malaysian NGOs, migrant worker organisations and UNICEF. This is because my findings are likely to highlight particular areas of concern for children themselves, whether specific problems encountered in moving around the city, finding work or accessing schooling. My findings are also likely to have a conceptual impact, reframing debates about child rights and migration amongst relevant advocacy groups, and (through media work in the final months of fieldwork) amongst the general public in Sabah.

By generating detailed data about the everyday lives of stateless children, this research will help NGOs to more specifically target practical help to improve stateless children's health and well-being, as well as providing illustrative material for policy campaigns against statelessness. This research will also contribute (in part through a website of stories and images) towards enhancing public understanding in the UK, Malaysia and beyond of the consequences of international migration for poor children in the global South.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>237328</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An exhibition of photographs taken by the children of migrants with whom I conducted research.

This impact follows from personal meetings, and dissemination through talks, blogs, a website, an article and a mixed media installation in Kota Kinabalu. I anticipate that as more of this research is published in the coming years, particularly once the book (in progress) based on this research comes out, these impacts will deepen, and new impacts will be generated. Since my research deals with a sensitive issue of public concern in Malaysia (and since it was conducted in a partially clandestine manner), impact on government policy towards the children of migrants may be harder to generate.

The research has had an impact on public awareness of the difficult issues facing children of migrants and refugees in Sabah. A blogpost of the widely-read 'New Mandala' website was co-published in the Asian Correspondent, and reported on elsewhere. An exhibition of photographs taken by children has generated considerable interest at the LSE in physical form, and through my website. Individual members of the public have written to me after seeing these photographs to express concern for and interest in these children. Several adults who were themselves the children of refugees facing statelessness have also contacted me.

The research is beginning to have an impact on understandings of and UNHCR campaigns against statelessness, though I anticipate that this impact will deepen in the future. I contributed a guest post to the Statelessness Programme Blog and spoke at the UNHCR First Global Forum on Statelessness, where I had many informal conversations with those working on these issues in the Asia Pacific region. This led to me being invited to join the Keenan Institute Working Group on Statelessness, based on Duke University, which is planning to make more interventions in debates on statelessness in the future, particularly through a special issue critically engaging with the UNHCR anti-statelessness campaigns.

My particular methodology of lending children cameras, which led to the photograph exhibition, has led to conversations with the NGO 'Lensational'. I helped them with the re-draft of their manual for volunteers and trainers. Meetings with representatives of UNICEF have helped shape their projects focusing on 'alternative education' for children of migrants.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B3F027DF-8FFC-4135-ABEC-DB5BE7C6AA97</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research explores the experiences of exclusion and belonging amongst the children of Indonesian and Filipino migrants and refugees in the Malaysian state of Sabah. Sabah is a state defined by a long history of movements and mixtures of people but where there is currently considerable public disquiet about demographic changes associated with high numbers of migrants. My research explores the experiences of children, since they have been affected in particularly severe ways by the Malaysian 'foreign workers' regime that structures the migration experiences of their parents and/ or grandparents.

My key findings can be summarised under three main headings:

1) Illegality and statelessness

One of the key aims of this project was to build a theoretical framework to understand the experience of 'illegality' and statelessness amongst children and young people. My research has uncovered the multiple ways in which children, as compared with adults, differently experience illegality. In particular, since foreign workers are not supposed to have families in Malaysia, their children face a problematic 'double illegality': the initial illegality of their birth, followed by the illegality associated with lack of documents. My research shows how, although many of these children are at risk of statelessness, this risk is not the primary determinant of their daily experiences. Some families who possess documentation granted to refugees prefer to prolong their lack of an effective nationality in order to 'hold out' for the Malaysian citizenship they feel is rightfully theirs. Statelessness in this context cannot, therefore, be separated out from other factors including illegality and economic exploitation.

2) Children, borders and temporality

This research utilises children's own stories, drawings and photographs in order to explore a child-focused perspective on migration. It contributes to discussions of ethnographic research with children by demonstrating the advantages of utilising child-directed visual methods. It shows how borders and movements appear quite different from the perspectives of children born across them. Children's images can disrupt conventional understandings of migration flows and movements. Their stories of assumed illegality and imposed 'foreignness' dispute the idea that the border is a distinct place, and demonstrate varied temporal understandings of the past, present and future.
 
3) Educational and other exclusions

Since 2002, 'foreign' children, whether or not they were born in Sabah, have been unable to access Malaysian government schooling. My research demonstrates the many negative consequences of this educational exclusion for children's understanding of their identities and their place in Malaysian society. It analyses histories of family decision-making in relation to children's education, and describes the consequences for children of the splitting of their families between Malaysia and a home country. It shows the problematic implications of the development of 'alternative learning centres', in which education is increasingly conceived as an act of charity rather than a right. My research also shows how learning centres, as well as factories and other sites of work, can be places of cosmopolitan belonging that are uniquely shaped by the history of Sabah.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My research has already been helpful to the work of the NGO 'Voice of the Children' in Malaysia, and to UNICEF Malaysia. I plan future collaborations with both of these organisations: highlighting lack of child rights in Sabah, and exploring the provision of 'alternative education' in the state. Other organisations with whom I will continue to liase, and that I will provide with descriptive stories that highlight difficult issues, include Humana Child Aid Society and the Philippines Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. I will continue to liase with UNHCR and researchers on statelessness to explore the consequences of child statelessness. My website will further disseminate the child-focused findings of my research, and these will be available to journalists and organisations to highlight the personal impact on children of increasingly harsh migration policies.

With regard to impact on Malaysian government policy, it is important to point out that, although I was granted a research permit by the federal 'Economic Planning Unit', this was taken away for political reasons at the local level in Sabah. The highly sensitive nature of my research, and public antipathy to migrant children, necessitates careful and pragmatic steps towards any impact on public discourse and policy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>60A67926-D846-4B5D-BE09-B5C7DFD8B3D9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://childrenofmigrationsabah.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/859099D6-3B82-444F-8D26-725E8E7606E7"><gtr:id>859099D6-3B82-444F-8D26-725E8E7606E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Questioning the scope and audience of anthropology</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Anthropology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5822a9c951c9a3a5867903ecb98f44ca"><gtr:id>5822a9c951c9a3a5867903ecb98f44ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Allerton C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/972EC51E-A49C-4C8A-9B0A-9A66D0D1C805"><gtr:id>972EC51E-A49C-4C8A-9B0A-9A66D0D1C805</gtr:id><gtr:title>Statelessness and the Lives of the Children of Migrants in Sabah, East Malaysia</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Tilburg Law Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5822a9c951c9a3a5867903ecb98f44ca"><gtr:id>5822a9c951c9a3a5867903ecb98f44ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Allerton C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J012262/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>32A0976A-B577-4829-A940-9AB6B148F977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area &amp; Development Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
