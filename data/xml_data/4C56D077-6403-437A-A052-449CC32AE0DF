This volume will offer a wide-ranging and up-to-date synthesis of a diverse group of prehistoric monuments found across lowland Scotland. Cursus monuments are generally dated to the early Neolithic (the 4th millennium BC) and take the form of large rectangular enclosures. Although typically recorded as earthwork monuments across the British Isles (with an internal bank and external ditch), there are at least 20 cursus monuments in Scotland that were defined by a pair of parallel rows of timber posts. These large rectangular enclosures range from as little as 60m in length to over 2km, and in width from 25m to around 100m. Despite the scale of these monuments, only one is still visible within the landscape (the remarkable Cleaven Dyke in Perth and Kinross); the remainder have been recorded as cropmarks in arable fields. Earthworks were gradually ploughed flat, while timber posts would have collapsed or decayed in prehistory. Yet these monuments must have been amongst the most spectacular elements of the early Neolithic landscape, and by far the largest structures ever built in Scotland until after 3000BC. A number of theories have been developed to explain the role of such monuments, ranging from ceremonial avenues or pathways, to monuments associated with death. What seems clear is that they would have required substantial labour, time and resources to construct, and were often in what we would imagine to be good farming land, which may have been sacrificed to make way for these monumental enclosures.\n\nThe proposed period of research leave will allow this book to be completed. Much of the book has been written already; study leave is required to complete some writing and check or revise the overall text. When completed, it is expected that this will be the standard reference book on this topic within Scotland, but also of interest to Neolithic specialists across northern Europe. The volume, then, will bring together a wide range of sites that morphologically appear to be cursus monuments, and a detailed synthesis of cropmark and excavation evidence will be carried out. The context of these discoveries will also be discussed; until aerial reconnaissance started in earnest in Scotland in 1976, for instance, only one cursus monument had been positively identified. Yet since then, around 50 have been discovered or identified. One of the key aspects of this book will be a detailed analysis of cropmark evidence with reference to what we know from excavations. This approach will allow the development and construction of these monuments to be considered. It is clear that cursus monuments did not exist in isolation, or spring from nowhere. The use of cursus locations before monument construction and the enduring presence of these sites in the landscape after abandonment will therefore be explored. Contemporary and ancillary monuments and land-use will be considered, as well as topographic location (many sites seem to have been chosen to exploit topography for instance, or to be close to rivers).\n\nThe outcome of this research will be a completed volume that places the cursus monuments of Scotland into their archaeological, landscape and social context. Possible roles and meanings of cursus monuments will be explored, with reference to their gradual construction and relationship with other monument and structural forms of the early Neolithic. Ultimately, the book will conclude that these were monumental articulations of everyday concerns in early Neolithic society whose construction drew together early farming communities in large-scale 'projects'. 'Reading between the lines' will offer an authoritative narrative of early Neolithic Scotland drawn from these invisible, but giant, monuments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28130</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The dissemination of my research has been slow to date, but outputs are now emerging which directly relate to the period of research this award relates to. The major impact to date has been in traditional academic terms. However, I have also been working on a public facing element to my research on cursus monuments, for instance currently designing a noticeboard about a cursus beneath a school campus in Perthshire. This cursus has also been the focus of classroom teaching and practical sessions with secondary school children, talks to local history groups and a walking tour as part of Scottish Archaeology Month.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3522101A-475A-42C1-85EB-D4EFFBABFDA2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My period of study leave allowed me the space to think and time to develop an in-depth narrative about Scotland's Neolithic cursus monuments. These early Neolithic rectangular ceremonial enclosures (3800-3300 BC) are amongst the earliest monuments built by the first farmers in Britain, and I was able to develop a narrative about their emergence within a dynamic woodland environment. The chronology and role in society were also explained, and I made a good deal of use of air photos taken by the publically funded RCAHMS. This research has wider applications within British Neolithic studies, but I am now developing tools and methods to bring these sites to a wider public audience.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>More community engagement work in particular related to cursus monuments in urban areas or under threat from development e.g. see http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/perth-kinross/town-could-grow-by-20-if-big-plans-are-approved-1.570042
