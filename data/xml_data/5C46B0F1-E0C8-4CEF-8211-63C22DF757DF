The brain processes information by sending electrical signals from neuron to neuron along these wires. Neurons are naturally connected to each other in a directed fashion. These connections form an immensely complicated network, whose structure is believed to be of crucial importance to its functionality. A &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;excited&amp;quot; neural system is system that is undergoing an electro-chemical process that varies with time. The structural architecture of the brain (as well as of biological, ecological, technological, and social networks) is typically studied using graph theory, where the network is viewed as a graph comprised of vertices and edges that model neurons and connections between them, respectively. It is universally accepted that the underlying structure of these networks shapes their emergent dynamics, even though a systematic approach to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of a networks is lacking. 

Neuroscience research typically produces immense amounts of data. Methods of analysis, statistics, dynamical systems and graph theory have been used in neuroscience and yielded remarkable results. With the growth of applications of topology in the past 10-15 years on one hand, and considering the fact that data emerging from neuroscience research naturally lends itself to topological analysis on the other hand, it is surprising that so far topological methods are only now starting to be introduced to the subject. This project will be a major attempt to address neuro-scientific questions by the methods of algebraic topology. 
 
A primary source of data for this project will be the digital reconstruction of the neocortical column of a young rat on a supercomputer, designed and built by Blue Brain Project (BBP). The reconstruction is based on rich biological data combined with strongly constrained stochastic processes and provide a biologically accurate model from which one can extract structural and functional data at an unprecedented level of detail. 

From the BBP reconstruction one can extract data that can be expressed as a connectivity matrix of a graph. Richer structures can be expressed by assigning appropriate weights to the graph. The guiding philosophy in this project is that much of the information encoded in the structure and function of a neural system expresses itself in high dimensional structure that one can associate to such graphs. We will consider data graphs, introduce systems of weights on graphs for certain applications, and to those graphs we will associate topological spaces by a variety of methods that will allow us to infer biological information from mathematical properties of the objects under consideration. 

The challenge in this project is to find ways in which the topology arising from neuro-scientific data, whether the source is the BBP or otherwise, reveals properties and features encoded in the data. Neuroscience typically produces &amp;quot;noisy&amp;quot; data. Yet, the brain of any living being is capable of performing remarkably complicated tasks consistently. It is the invariant properties within the data that neuroscientists in general are constantly searching for. Topology is perfectly suitable for detecting invariant properties in geometric structures. Thus the aim of this project is by and large to discover ways of detecting consistent behaviour of neural systems through the topology their structure and function give rise to.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is interdisciplinary and collaborative by its nature. It involves mathematical methodology of algebraic topology and related subjects on the theoretical side, computer science on the computational side, and of course neuroscience. The main collaborator on the mathematical side is Kathryn Hess and members of her group UPHESS. On the computational side Pawel Dlotko will provide his coding skill as well as conceptual advice and ideas. The main source of data and knowledge in neuroscience that we have secured at this point is the Blue Brain Project, under the directorship of Henry Markram. Data emerging from the Blue Brain Project reconstruction is rich, precise and available in abundance sufficient for many sub-projects.

The methods we plan to use in this project and those that will develop as we progress are not restricted to the collaboration with the Blue Brain Project. K. Hess had already initiated two collaborations in EPFL with clinical neuroscience groups studying certain mental disorders. The PI is part of both projects. In Aberdeen, the PI has two budding collaboration. The first with L. Heisler of the Rowett Institute, where we apply topological methods to a study of obesity, The second is with K. Wu, a petroleum engineer from the School of Engineering in Aberdeen, where the subject of study is fluid flow in porous media.

While methods and applications develop, the PI will strive to establish further collaborations with wet-lab neuroscientists, theoretical neuroscientists, and potentially scientists from other relevant disciplines. Of particular interest may be applications to the study of general networks, where the questions are in fact very similar to those arising in neuroscience. While in this proposal the PI does not request support for these potentially fruitful collaboration, the potential is evident, and given the type of applications, societal impact is very likely.

Topological methods have already proven to be useful in a variety of sciences, and there is currently a surge of activity in the subject. In 2017 alone three major conferences in applied topology are planned:
* &amp;quot;Applied topology in Bedlewo&amp;quot;, Bedlewo, Poland, 25.6.17-1.7.17.
* &amp;quot;Applied and Computational Algebraic Topology&amp;quot;, Hausdorff Institute, Bonn, Germany, 24.4.17-6.5.17 and 4-29.9.17.
* &amp;quot;Applied algebraic topology&amp;quot;, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan, 8-12.8.17.
All three conferences will have applications of topology to neuroscience among their themes. The PI was invited to give a lecture series on topology in neuroscience intended for graduate students and young participants in Bedlewo. The PI and K. Hess are among the organising committee of the conference in Hokkaido.

This explosion of activity serves to show the evident importance and timeliness of this proposal. In particular, the involvement of topology in neuroscience is very recent, and to date it is being pursued by a very small number of research groups. Furthermore, none of those groups have access to a brain simulation system nearly as advanced as that of the BBP. Of course, as knowledge spreads this will not remain the case for long. This is therefore a fantastic opportunity to place a strong UK based group on the emerging map of applications of topology to neuroscience. 

Neuroscience is obviously a part of life science, where the potential for societal impact is tremendous. Mathematics has been used in neuroscience from a very early stage with considerable success. Our novel topological approach to the analysis of neuroscientific data and phenomena has a strong potential to yield results that by their nature will have a strong non-academic impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>711299</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P025072/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
