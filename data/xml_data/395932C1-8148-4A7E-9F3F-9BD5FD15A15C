Contemporary preparedness makes use of a spectrum of pedagogies

including public and dramaturgical.



Contemporary preparedness efforts rely on a mixture of pedagogies. The use of text

instructions, memory aids, reconstruction activities, and information technologies and

video are frequently part of the pedagogical mix that becomes part of a fused pedagogy of affect, behaviour, and cognition. These can be analysed not just in terms of 'conventional' pedagogical categories. 



Firstly, they can be examined as public pedagogies, popular cultural forms that are pedagogical through enactment rather than (necessarily) direct teaching.



Secondly, drama and performance are employed in contemporary sites of preparedness to produce 'theatres of survival' which are often racially orientated towards the representation of and prioritising of 'white' racial interests. This points towards understanding contemporary preparedness as not only multi-modal and pedagogical but increasingly using new pedagogical techniques (the public and the dramaturgical). This finding has informed future research through an EPSRC and ESRC funded project (John Preston PI) 'Game Theory and Adaptive Networks for Smart Evacuations' (October 2010-October 2012) which will examine the ways in which we can understand and improve city evacuations as 'co-produced' by the public, usingmulti-modal technologies.



2. Race, 'tacit intentionality' and the 'absent presence' of 'race' in

preparedness



In none of our research did we encounter any participant who was prejudiced or any

evidence of overt racism in policy. However, tacitly assumptions were often made

which could disadvantage BME people. Following the work of Gillborn, we would

refer to these as 'tacit intentionality' in that by not taking 'race' explicitly into account in preparedness or policy planning some are tacitly advantaged or disadvantaged. Preparedness materials which advantage 'whites' also intersect with other social characteristics such as masculinity.



Examples of good practice included awareness of multiple language materials, taking

into account access to material resources in preparedness planning.



3. Who is preparedness for?



In our focus group research a common finding was that no one considered that

preparedness was 'for them'. This lack of connection (and sometimes outright

rejection) of preparedness was due to issues of representation and consultation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research highlights to central and local government the importance of racial and other types of equity in emergency and preparedness planning. Scientific impacts



The project will have impacts in terms of the design of preparedness materials. We have

alerted our networks to our findings via our website. Chakrabarty has developed

considerable local authority, national and international contacts in this area of research

that could lead to future collaborations and we have existing, and expected, future grant

funding for work in this area as detailed above.



This project has made important developments in Critical Race Theory, public pedagogy

and performance theory, bringing these areas together in an inter-disciplinary fashion.

We and will continue to present our work in high status journals, books and at

international conferences. An anticipated future impact will also be a synoptic book as

we build up a body of work from this project.



Economic and Social impacts



The project has emphasised the importance of the inclusion of BME groups in

preparedness planning and the importance of this for equity. We will continue to

present our work at conferences with a practice / academic / social justice focus (as

Chakrabarty 2010a, 2010b, 2010c) and to work with groups outside of academia

('Emergency Exercise 2010' as part of the ESRC festival of social science being one

example).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DDF77907-42E5-4CAB-925D-5ECCBA0B9CF0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://s290179663.websitehome.co.uk/prepare/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G036195/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3437</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
