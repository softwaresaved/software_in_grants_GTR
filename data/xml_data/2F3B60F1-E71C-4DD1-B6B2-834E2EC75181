Late Antique, Lombard, Byzantine and Carolingian Italy have been written on across the period 400 to 850, but the late 9th and the 10th centuries have been much less studied, though they constitute an essential component in this development of medieval and modern Italy, and Europe more generally. This period represents a key transitional link between the Mediterranean-centered focus of Italian politics and culture up to 750, and the emerging role of later medieval Italy as part and parcel of the rising power of medieval, Renaissance and modern western Europe North of the Alps from 800 to the 18th century. The period is also a key element for discerning the roots of the later success of the much better known history of the Italian communes and city-states from the 12th century onwards. This project proposes to study the way in which the three main Byzantine cities of northern Italy: Rome, Ravenna and Venice, dealt with the imperial ideologies and policies they had to face through their relationship with the empires of Byzantium, of Charlemagne and his heirs, and of the German Ottonians, especially in the 9th and 10th centuries. The response of the three cities' authorities to this inevitable pressure contributed, to very different degrees, to the construction of their own civic identity. We will be examining the political and social priorities which led their ruling elites to choose alliance with, or opposition to, the imperial constraint, and the political, religious and cultural choices made by them, under the direction of popes, archbishops and doges. We will see how different factions fought for control of each city through these choices, and how internal city politics influenced the political and ideological choices which underlie the creation of each city's identity. Defining and analyzing the power of these elites, their culture and manifestations within the city through, among others, narratives, history-making foundation accounts, acts of government, diplomacy and exchanges, prosopography and titles, government apparatus and ceremonial, religious foundations and endowments, public acts of piety, and architectural and artistic creations, helps us not only to comprehend the later success of the Italian city model, but also better to appreciate the role of ideology and culture in the construction of any corporate identity, through the creation and constant re-interpretation of a real or mythical past and present.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic beneficiaries of the work carried out in this research project are potentially found in two areas: the cultural and Heritage sphere including museums displays, temporary exhibitions and the tourism industry; and those interested in the construction and definition of civic cultures. In the cultural and Heritage sphere, this research would be of considerable use for museum and exhibition curators in the first place. Past major European exhibitions such as Venice and Byzantium (Venice, Paris and London in the 1970s), The Transformation of the Roman World (London, 1997), Rome and the Barbarians (Venice and Cologne, 2007) or Byzantium (London, 2009), for example, which were all major public successes. Curators will benefit from such up-to-date expertise when future exhibitions are planned. So will the curators of permanent collections, museums, and archaeological sites open to the public, either in Italy or wherever relevant artefacts from this period are to be found. The second category of beneficiaries would be those concerned with civic cultures. As has long been recognised by the interest shown in studies such as Joseph La Palombara's Democracy Italian Style, Italian states provide a major case study for the long-term development of civic cultures, and the resilience of democratic decision-making cultures. An older account relates this to the civic cultures of the Renaissance, but much recent historiography has been more concerned to root it in Italy's medieval city-states. Our study, by taking that story further back, will provide further evidence for those who wish to ponder how far the forms of civic organisation nurtured in northern and central Italy provide a basis for the construction of local civic structures.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>321844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>State Archives of Venice (Archivio di Stato di Venezia)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Publication of the Codice Lanfranchi</gtr:description><gtr:id>6BEA4237-5B7C-4C7D-9439-63D063265DC9</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>The third planned outcome from the project was the possible publication of the important manuscript edition of all Venetian documents up to 1200, known as the Codice Lanfranchi from its author, who was active in the 1940s. This manuscript is at present in the Archivio di stato in Venice, with access partially controlled by the heirs of Dr Lanfranchi. The project plan did not commit us to the publication (which would in itself be an expensive process, and would need to be undertaken by people in Venice), but rather to the exploration of all possibilities concerning its publication by others. Dr West-Harling gained the consent of the family to its publication, and managed to get all the players in Venice to meet together to plan it, including people who had not spoken to each other for years. The outcome is that the Archivio di stato is actively considering how to publish it, and the main discussion is in what form. This we count as a successful outcome, therefore.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The importance of the different imperial connections which different parts of Italy had across the early middle ages.
