Artists often adapt industrial and digital technologies to work with creatively, as evidenced by the use of digital printing, to create artists' books and prints. This project would create new methodologies for artists' creative production methods.\n\nAs the technology becomes more affordable, laser cutters are a regular feature within secondary, further and higher education. This project aims explore the potential of the laser cutter as a tool for artists working with the book form and paper-based work, and see how it can replace the need for labour intensive manipulation of paper and card by hand. The project also aims to change attitudes to creative making and increase awareness of the advantage of new technologies for artists/craftspeople.\n\nManipulating paper on a laser cutter is being explored within industry, but what remains relatively unexplored is the possibility of using the laser cutter as a creative production tool for artists and craftspeople. One aspect that is unappealing to many artists is that the normal carbon dioxide laser cutter will burn and scorch the edges of the paper. With an investigation into which papers cut with the least amount of burning and by utilising nitrogen instead of oxygen as the cutting catalyst, this should reduce any scorching to an absolute minimum. \n\nThe PI researches and assists artists and designers with laser cutting and feels that the potential of these machines is under-explored. As part of this bid the PI would be developing his own practice as a book artist with the use of the laser cutting process. This involves exploring the possibilities of using the laser cutters in conjunction with digital printing to produce accurate cuts and folds within the book, in relation to the printed imagery. The results of this would be used as one of the three in-depth case studies in the final outcomes.\n\nThe PI will also work with two other book artists who have yet to engage with laser cutters as a creative production tool. The possibility of using the laser as a tool for cutting, scoring, perforating and engraving paper is as yet underutilised by book and paper artists. Many artists use hand cutting and scoring in their work unaware that laser cutters can assist in many of the more mundane aspects of producing editions or unique works. The laser cutter need not replace the handcrafted element rather run alongside it. This would allow the artist to produce larger editions more effectively and allow the work to be distributed to a wider audience.\n\nThe artists will be invited to be a case study resident at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR), University of the West of England, and work intensively over a four day period, producing new work that explores the use of the laser cutters. The new work produced on residency will be exhibited at four venues in the UK and Denmark over 2010 - 2011. \n\nTo present this applied research within an academic context, the findings of the project will also be published online to allow for greater dissemination and to provoke further discussion and development of the laser cutter as a creative production tool. Collectively the case studies will be written up and submitted for publication as an article in 'The Bonefolder', 'The Journal of Artists' Books' and 'AfterImage'. Free cutting guides, aimed at artists, designers, craftspeople and those in education, will be available as PDFs on the CFPR book arts website. A critical essay on the project's outcomes will also be available on the book arts website as a PDF. \n\nA one-day symposium for twenty-five delegates will present the project, demonstrate the process and feedback into the project report. One of the case study artists will also present the work produced on residency and discuss how the process of using a laser cutter impacted on the creative production of their work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims to change attitudes to creative making, and increase awareness of the advantages of new technologies for artists/craftspeople, and to develop the longer-term potential of laser cutting as part of their armoury. As artists often adapt industrial and digital technologies to work with creatively (such as the use of digital and wide-format printing to create artists' books over recent years) this project has the potential to add another dimension to artists' creative production methods.\n\nThe symposium will be an opportunity for artists, practice-led researchers and creative makers to network and identify areas in which laser cutting can add value to their own practice and professional development. The project's outcomes such as the case studies and cutting guides will support makers and artists in the creative industries as well as teachers and researchers in schools, FE and HEIs, through online access to innovative practice which will allow them to enhance their creative skills and physical output of artworks. The case studies would offer models for researchers/artists/craftspeople exploring new technology, and allow the artists involved the chance to exchange and develop ideas in their working practice.\n\nAn estimated total of 300-400 potential audience figures for the exhibitions would raise awareness of the artists' work, offer active engagement with the physical basis of creating the work and disseminate the contextual field surrounding it, highlighting the cultural value of the artworks created. Online viewing of the artworks created and critical essay, would also offer international dissemination of the outputs to artists and researchers via CFPR's bookarts website.\n\nThe project would also enhance intellectual capital through the PI's own learning experience and the extension of the exhibition to lectures and a peer-reviewed article would establish a base for the development of further research in this field. \n\nThe outcomes would also feed into UWE, Bristol's CPD classes for artists, designers, creative practitioners, micro and small companies, teachers and researchers to develop their skills and enhance knowledge in the wider creative community. The outcomes would also be disseminated through The Book Arts Newsletter (circulation 2,000) and the bookarts.uwe.ac.uk website (with an average of 959 point of entry visits per day evidenced on our international tracking figures).\n\nPotential beneficiaries in the academic, creative arts, professional and practitioner groups would include: artists, craftspeople, printmakers, designer bookbinders, book designers, small publishers, paper engineers, designers and private presses. Groups such as the Society of Bookbinders, Designer Bookbinders, Fine Press Book Association UK, the Society of Altered Book Artists (USA) and Canadian Bookbinders' Guild would also be alerted to the outcomes.\n\nThe invited presentation of the project's intentions at the Doverodde Book Arts Festival in Denmark would inform the audience of Scandinavian and German artists, designers, curators, bookbinders and societies, which would in turn feed into the wider European network of artists and craftspeople.\n\nFurther international dissemination through external independent organisations and societies' Internet sites, include those which have externally linked to our own bookarts website, and which could also be used to publicise and disseminate the outcomes, such as: College Book Art Association; Artist Books 3.0 networking forum sites (based in Australia and Latin America, with 790 and 820 members respectively); www.kuenstlerbuecher.com and www.forumbookart.com in Germany; The Italian Association for the Promotion of Artists' Books and Private Presses; The Fine Press Book Association USA, and www.theartistsbook.org.za resource site in South Africa. \n\nThese would allow for maximum free</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31957</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>New work produced with Mette-Sofie D.

Tom Sowden assumed a role of facilitator, more in the manner of a traditional master printer, to advise on possibilities and facilitate the optimum outcomes for the period of the case study. The ideas for what would be produced had to come from the artists without interference from Sowden, so that the machines would be approached with an open mind about their potential capabilities, not hindered with any assumptions or limitations Sowden could predict for a proposed piece of work. The artefacts created with Sue Blackwell were 'Remnants' exhibited at the Bront&amp;euml; Parsonage Museum in Haworth. And 'Happily Ever After' was exhibited at Long &amp;amp; Ryle Contemporary Art, London.

At the moment, the stumbling block for many a prospective user is an understanding of what the machine is capable of, and the software needed to produce the desired results. But as more and more children use this equipment for design technology classes as they progress through school, this will become less of an issue, and hopefully the equipment can then be fully tested as the creative tool it can be. By the time they have become degree or post-graduate students, or practicing artists and designers, there will be no steep learning curve for them - the possibilities of the technology will be in relation to ideas and how far it can be pushed. Just as long as the unique qualities that this technology can offer are embraced and not hidden.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Drawing with Fire: An exhibition of laser cutting by book and paper artists</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bookarts.uwe.ac.uk/papermods11.htm</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The second case study was with Mette-Sofie D.

One of the major case study artists, Mette-Sofie D. Ambeck, has since gone on to produce another laser engraved edition artist's book. Dust to Dust was produced in an edition of 10 in 2012, with laser engraving by Tom Sowden. It is now in the public collection of the Tate, Manchester Metropolitan University Library, UCA Epsom Library and Winchester School of Art Library, and it was selected for the Fifth International Artists' Book Exhibition 2013 at Szent Istv&amp;aacute;n Kir&amp;aacute;ly M&amp;uacute;zeum, Sz&amp;eacute;kesfeh&amp;eacute;rv&amp;aacute;r, Hungary where it has been donated to the permanent collection.

The other major case sudy artist, Su Blackwell, used the work produced on residency for two major solo exhibitions. 'Remnants' at Bronte Parsonage Museum, Haworth, Aug - Nov 2010. 'Happily Ever After', Long &amp;amp; Ryle, London, Nov - Dec 2010. Blackwell continues to use the methodologies developed during this project to produce work that is exhibited internationally.

All outputs from the project are available as downloads from the CFPR Book Arts website (http://www.bookarts.uwe.ac.uk/projects/papermodels.html). Aimed particularly at those who wish to use laser-cutting technology to manipulate paper and card, those offering this as a service and those within education for whom it has relevance, these downloads and description of the project are available for free.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0F534D3A-AEF2-4E45-B223-0A6735DE9A14</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Before embarking on this research project I had assumed that the laser cutter's strength lay in the fact that it could replace intensive hand cutting and scoring to assist in the production of book and paper based artworks. Written in the summary of my initial application for funding I stated: 'This project aims to explore the potential of the laser cutter as a tool for artists working with the book form and paper-based work, and see how it can replace the need for labour intensive manipulation of paper and card by hand.' As the project began and progressed I realised that yes, this is what a laser cutter can be used for, but it can also offer so much more to the artist and designer.

The laser cutter is a very good tool at recreating and replicating that which already occurs as a hand-cut artwork. A digital file can be produced with relative ease that allows for facsimile copies to be made that look almost identical to the original. This allows for easy distribution and meeting demand, at a cost that makes it affordable to many.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Independent artists, designers and craftspeople in the creative industries
