Its establishment is timely, developing from two international conferences on gender and politics in early modern Europe organised by the PI and CI since 2008. From these events emerged a group of scholars with shared interests in letters, gender and political culture, which expanded into materiality, specifically as it relates to early modern archives and gift-giving. In this context, the network studies relationships between gender, power and materiality, defined both in terms of physical objects or material texts and the social and cultural practices, and spaces in which they were produced, consumed, exchanged and displayed. It focusses on different forms of elite power across the early modern period in Europe, and encompasses formal and cultural power.
Influenced by the 'material turn', the network considers objects as social agents, analysing the gendered power embedded within physical artefacts and the social practices of production, consumption and exchange, especially in relation to early modern practices and modern theories of gift-giving. It questions how far materiality made gender positions stable and unstable; and studies objects to reconstruct new networks and gendered forms of power created around object exchange and production. Secondly, it considers archives as a form of gendered power, and spaces (e.g. noble households, courts, libraries) in which material objects were located, and their connection with the politics of memory, gift-giving and display. The newness of this approach lies both in viewing power and materiality through the lens of gender, and the application of diverse approaches bringing into dialogue historians, literary critics, material culture specialists, anthropologists, archaeologists (who bring an understanding of objects and theory), and curators, archivists and conservators. Furthermore, the network prompts an important process of recovery of a range of physical objects across Europe (eg jewels, books and other gifts) which will be considered alongside documents like letters, inventories and accounts. The link with the 'Women's Early Modern Letters Online' project facilitates integrated exploration of material and written texts, and hosting by the Bodleian ensures digital sustainability. Importantly, the network brings together international scholars working on different contexts, who specialise on various UK and non-UK records (Scandinavian, Dutch, French and German), and bring together different historiographies, historical traditions and palaeographical skills. Proceedings will be in English, but in different European settings, allowing access to work ordinarily only available in different languages.
The network plans three workshops (in Lund, Sweden; Leiden, The Netherlands; and Perth, Australia) and a conference in Plymouth. The first stage is a workshop 'Gender, Power and Theories of Materiality in Early Modern Europe' to investigate underpinning methodologies. The second stage will be an opening 'state-of-the-field' international conference ('Gender, Power and Materiality in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1800'), which will be an open call for papers to allow for the possibility of expanding the network over a range of disciplines and geographical areas. The third stage will be a symposium on 'Gender and the Politics of Early Modern Archives/Spaces'; while the fourth stage will be a capstone workshop on 'Gender, Emotions and the Dynamics of Early Modern Gift-Exchange'. The network will produce a jointly-authored journal article, an edited collection, and a special edition of a journal on 'Archives and Spaces'. The network website will be developed at the outset of the project, and utilised over the two years and beyond as a mechanism of digital scholarly sociability, to publicise events and research, and host an online exhibition.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have identified a wide range of non-academic beneficiaries who will derive different kinds of impact from the research generated by the network. These include:
i) museums and archives in the UK, Sweden and The Netherlands. Each of the three European 'nodes' at Plymouth, Lund and Leiden has identified a series of local partner institutions as end-users for the research deriving from the network, with whom relationships are already established and which we would like to further develop. In the UK, this will include the Victoria and Albert Museum; in Sweden, Skarhults kulturminne, which hosts the Den Dolda Kvinnomakten ('The Hidden Power of Women') exhibition, and its owner Baroness Alexandra von Schwerin, and the National Archive (Riksarkivet), Stockholm; and in The Netherlands, The Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague, the Museum Catharijne Convent Utrecht, and The Hague Historical Museum.
ii) curators, archivists and specialists working in the Heritage and Public History industries.
iii) visitors to museums, including the V&amp;amp;A, Skarhults Slott, the Museum Catharijne Convent Utrecht, and The Hague Historical Museum.
iv) local history groups and societies, including the Plymouth branch of the Historical Association, Devon History Society and Friends of Devon Archives.
v) educators (teachers and lecturers) and school children and undergraduate students.
vi) the Swedish government and Department of Education.

The ways in which these non-academic end-users will benefit from the impact of research produced by the network is wide-ranging and varied. Potential impacts include:
i) strengthening international relationships between museums, archives and academics in the UK, Sweden and The Netherlands.
ii) developing archival and museology practices as they relate to the ways in which collections are approached, curated, displayed and studied through sharing practices between a range of international scholars working in different academic disciplines (History, Literature and Art History), and curators, archivists and specialists working in the Heritage and Public History industries.
iii) enhancing the visitor experience through new methods of display, and so developing cultural and social benefits for visitors.
iv) providing expert knowledge contributing to the development of items (e.g. jewellery and postcards) for sale in museum shops, thus leading to financial benefits for the museums and for the regional economies.
v) engaging local history groups in the South West of the UK, and the general public in an aspect of their cultural heritage through various public engagement activities (lectures and public talks), thus contributing to their knowledge, skills and quality of life.
vi) enhancing schools' engagement with museum-based collections, via developing materials in the form of teaching packs repurposing research for use in the classroom, aligned with the National Curriculum. 
vii) providing expert knowledge contributing to public policy debates in Sweden (in association with Skarhults kulturminne, and its owner Baroness Alexandra von Schwerin) relating to curriculum change in the teaching of History within Swedish classrooms in order to enhance the study of women in the past.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36384</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture at Tiverton Church delivered by Professor James Daybell, 22 October 2015 on Gertrude Marchioness of Exeter  - delivered to the Courtenay Society and members of the General Public</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>39666FCC-C4EB-48D0-9CA3-276BB86BF4B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This public lecture was delivered at Tiverton Church as an event as part of the annual meeting of the international Courtenay Society and Powderham Castle, Devon.

The four days brought together academic members of the network with key non-HEI partners from Skarhults kulturmine (Baroness Alexandra von Schwerin), the Victoria and Albert Museum, Swedish National Archives, and from museums in The Netherlands. Day one (Sunday 25 October) involved a meeting between the network steering committee to discuss the network management and final plans for the workshop, a meeting with V&amp;amp;A staff to discuss future collaborations, and a networking event in the evening; day two was based at Skarhults Slott and introduced the network steering committee and collaborators formally, discussed future collaborations, and also involved a tour of the castle's exhibition. The network is a formal collaborator with the castle's exhibition, and consulted over future developments. Day three was based at Lund university and involved theoretical discussions and a writing workshop with the intention of developing a new theoretical/methodological framework for studying gender, power and materiality, and working on a collaboratively written output.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Filming for the BBC documentary on Versailles - presented by Lucy Worsley, 19 November 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F80DDEE9-4FE7-4BE9-B11F-309206033980</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Filming with Lucy Worsley for a new BBC documentary on Versailles, as a tie-in with the 10-part French TV drama series to be broadcast in 2016.
