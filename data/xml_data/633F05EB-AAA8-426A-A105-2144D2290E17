In the UK this benefit is currently not being maximised as we do not have a consolidated action plan for design that that provides a compelling case for that assists decision-makers to employ design effectively. A growing number of European countries have developed action plans for design including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland and Latvia. The UK is not one of them. 

This innovative research project synthesises for the first time, multi-stakeholder and user-led perspectives to generate original insights that go beyond existing approaches in the UK through the development of an integrated action plan to increase and enhance the strategic use of design as a driver for innovation and provides a roadmap to how that could be achieved.

Our research approach will: a) draw in multi-stakeholder views that hitherto have not been synthesised and combined together (synergising individual agendas into a compelling and coherent argument to maximise the impact of design), b) provide new insights that informs a high-level strategic understanding of the potential of design to drive societal and economic benefit in organisations (to foreground the capability of the strategic use design to drive innovation), and c) set out a series of integrated steps (the 'action plan') required to enable the operationalization of design through an actionable plan (with examples of potential application of design in the public and private sectors).

The plan will include key action lines for implementation which aim:

1) to increase the awareness of how design creates high-level societal and economic benefit resulting in increased competitiveness of, and wellbeing in, the UK; 
2) to extend the understanding of design as a strategic tool as a driver for innovation in the suppliers (design sector), users (design buyers, commissioners and managers), and beneficiaries (end users of products and services); 
3) to achieve economic benefit through an enhancing the strategic understanding of the economic value of design as a driver for innovation in targeted private sector user groups (e.g. R&amp;amp;D managers, brand managers, design buyers, etc.); 
4) to provide a strong impetus for the effective application of design in the public sector resulting in improved services, enhanced experiences and quality of life; and 
5) to transform the ability of the users of design to translate a strategic understanding of the value of design into operationalized activities.

As formal project partners, the Design Council provide opportunities for enhanced impact by supporting engagement with key stakeholders, policy makers and opinion-formers through:

- Active participation in the research through membership of the project Steering Group
- Promotion of the project and sharing of findings with policy audiences in particular, through Design for Europe platform and Design Council UK networks
- Support for online engagement with target audiences drawing on our existing networks
- Insights generated by the 2015 Design Economy research, which maps design businesses and their economic contribution at a local level across the UK
- Co-authoring an introductory text for the final project publication
- Hosting of a high-profile event at our offices in central London to launch the project research findings</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Building on the 5 identified impacts in our Pathways to Impact document, here we expand on who we envisage benefiting from this research and develop further how they might benefit:

i1) To increase the awareness of how design creates high-level societal and economic benefit resulting in increased competitiveness of, and wellbeing in, the UK. Provides stakeholders (policy makers, design buyers, design suppliers) with a compelling evidence base to support the endorsement of design in their respective contexts thus influence opinion-formers to maximise the value design generates. Mechanisms such as the steering group, thought leadership panels, online forum, social media, dissemination events (Houses of Parliament, Design Council HQ) and targeted workshops aim to extend awareness of design through peer-to-peer advocacy, exposure to exemplars and rich debate.
 
i2) To extend the understanding of design as a strategic tool as a driver for innovation in the suppliers (design sector), users (design buyers, commissioners and managers), and beneficiaries (end users of products and services) of design. Extending understanding of design-driven innovation in a tailored, context aware and nuanced manner provides beneficiaries with the knowledge to employ design (in the respective contexts/sectors/regions) effectively, efficiently and ultimately strategically. By foregrounding the link between design and innovation, there is opportunity for public and private sectors to access funding traditionally reserved for innovation and/or social innovation (Innovate UK, HLF) thus maximising societal (enhanced wellbeing, increased social cohesion) and economic (innovative products, efficiency gains) benefit.

i3) To achieve economic benefit through an enhancing the strategic understanding of the economic value of design as a driver for innovation in targeted private sector user groups (e.g. R&amp;amp;D managers, brand managers, design buyers, etc.). Private sector use of design (commissioned from external consultancies or via an in-house resource) is applied to styling, processes and to strategic considerations (Danish Design Ladder). The more strategic the use of design the better organisations perform - the DMI Design Value Index (2014) shows design-driven companies maintain significant stock market advantage, outperforming the S&amp;amp;P (the US stock market index) by 228%. This provides commissioners of design (R&amp;amp;D managers, marketing managers) with evidence recognising design as an investment rather than a cost resulting in an increases use of design (benefiting the design sector and freelancers).

i4) To provide a strong impetus for the effective application of design in the public sector resulting in improved services, enhanced experiences and quality of life. The public sector in the UK is recognising the value of design to address the complex challenges they face and when employed effectively, resulting in demonstrable benefits to both the users of design within the public sector (design managers, service leaders, innovation directors, etc.) and the ultimate beneficiaries who access these services. Through exposure to exemplars of the effective use of design to drive innovation via workshops, website and social media activity, thought leadership panels, etc. there is potential to give the public sector the ability to more in an efficient and targeted manner.

i5) To transform the ability of the users of design to translate a strategic understanding of the value of design into operationalized activities. While an understanding of the strategic value of design is critical, it is also imperative to enable users and beneficiaries of design (policy makers, design commissioners, innovation leaders, design sector, end users) to be able to translate this understanding into tangible activities and projects. This will provide benefits in terms of maximising the potential value of design and increasing its uses in effective, efficient and impactful ways.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>468095</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P005934/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
