Until now the methods used for assessing environmental quality have been based largely on tests for toxicity, chemical measurements and the use of conventional biomarkers. However, since the late 1990s there has been a rapid increase in the range of molecular biology techniques and approaches available to assist in chemical risk assessment and environmental monitoring. The ability of these techniques to investigate the responses of organisms in the environment to stress at a molecular level has considerable potential to complement existing assessment and monitoring strategies. However, one of the major needs identified by the regulatory bodies worldwide is the demonstration that the molecular responses can accurately reflect or predict the toxicity of a chemical towards organisms in the environment. This proposal intends to provide a case-study that will serve as a proof-of-principle allowing progress in the implementation of these molecular techniques to be made with more confidence. The proposal was devised by an international consortium at a workshop funded by the NERC and will involve extensive international collaboration and co-funding. Fish (Zebrafish for which there is extensive information on the genome) will be exposed to a model pollutant (dinitrophenol) at a range of doses and analysed at a range of time points. A detailed analysis of the multiple metabolite and gene expression changes that occur in the liver will be assessed and the relationship to effects on the survival and growth of the fish will be determined. Computer-assisted informatic approaches will allow specific associations to be determined allowing us to characterise the molecular responses that are truely predictive of toxicity from those changes that are simply adaptive. A seminar will be presented to a wide range of end-users including the UK Environment Agency on the results and their implications for future environmental quality assessments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22590</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Malaysia</gtr:country><gtr:department>Bachok Research Station</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration / Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>AC2DD6BA-583D-42DC-BBCF-1B6B6585A222</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Collaborations in this project also include with the National Institute of Basic Biology and Min of Environment ?

Knowledge gained from this project was use to engage with relevant stakeholders (industry, government regulators, other academics) through international workshops on ecotoxicogenomics in Vancouver, as part of a UK-Japan collaboration meeting in Exeter and in Tokyo, Japan, and a NERC funded genomics workshop at Exeter. These activities and subsequent publications undoubtedly helped shape the uptake and acceptance of transcriptomics (and sequencing) into current developing chemical test guidelines for 'omics' at the OECD, and in ecotoxicology more widely. 

Our work on the application of molecular approaches applied in ecotoxicology has appeared widely in national and international newspapers, in NERC News, and on various television programmes. 

This project and the knowledge gained from it lead to other significant research projects funded by NERC, defra, the UK Environment Agency, AstraZeneca, and EU.

The PDRA working on this project (Dr Santos) subsequently obtained a permanent position in academia as a lecturer.</gtr:description><gtr:id>379FEA8D-4D0F-4932-B315-F5425146AD39</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant originally set out to assess the use of 'omics' in distinguishing between toxic and adaptive responses in zebrafish exposed to dinitrophenol. The in life exposures were designed and duly conducted at Exeter and the material for 'omics' analyses sent to the collaborating partner (Birmingham) where gene arrays and metabolomics analyses were undertaken. The findings from this study were not especially informative in terms of the biological effects seen nor were the subsequent 'omics' analyses. Retrospectively, a better chemical could have been made to address the specifics of the original question.

Nevertheless, the grant gave the collaborators excellent opportunity to develop better understanding and engagement for the application of 'omics' into assessments on effects of chemicals for risk assessment. The data from this project ,and other projects, was used in a series of engagements with relevant stakeholders (industry, government regulators, other academics) at (inter)national workshops to encourage uptake and acceptance of transcriptomics (and sequencing) into chemical test guidelines and in ecotoxicology more widely.
