on understanding how the Universe works at a very fundamental level. The distance scales 
with which they work vary by 50 orders of magnitude from the smallest distances probed 
by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, deep within the atomic 
nucleus, to the largest scale galaxy clusters discovered out in space. The Science challenges, 
however, are linked through questions such as: How did the Universe begin and how is it evolving? 
and What are the fundamental constituents and fabric of the Universe and how do they interact?

Progress requires new astronomical observations and experimental data but also 
new theoretical insights. Theoretical understanding comes increasingly from large-scale 
computations that allow us to confront the consequences of our theories very accurately 
with the data or allow us to interrogate the data in detail to extract information that has 
impact on our theories. These computations test the fastest computers that we have and 
push the boundaries of technology in this sector. They also provide an excellent 
environment for training students in state-of-the-art techniques for code optimisation and 
data mining and visualisation. 

The DiRAC-2.5 project builds on the success of the DiRAC HPC facility and will provide the resources needed
to support cutting edge research during 2017 in all areas of science supported by STFC.

In particular, DiRAC-2.5 will provide:

1) A factor 2 increase in the computational power of the DiRAC supercomputer at the University of Durham, which is designed for simulations requiring large amounts of computer memory. The enhanced system will be used to:
(i) simulate the merger of pairs of black holes which generate gravitational waves such as those recently discovered by the LIGO consortium;
(ii) perform the most realistic simulations to date of the formation and evolution of galaxies in the Universe
(iii) carry out detailed simulations of the interior of the sun and of planetary interiors.

2) A new High Performance Computer whose particular architecture is well suited to the theoretical 
problems that we want to tackle that utilise large amounts of data, either as input or 
being generated at intermediate stages of our calculations. Two key challenges
that we will tackle are those of 
(i) improving our understanding of the Milky Way through analysis of new data from the European 
Space Agency's GAIA satellite and 
(ii) improving the potential of experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider for discovery
of new physics by increasing the accuracy of theoretical predictions for rare processes involving the 
fundamental constituents of matter known as quarks.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The expected impact of DiRAC-2.5 is fully described in the pathways to impact section of the case for support and includes:

1) Disseminating best practice in High Performance Computing software engineering throughout the theoretical Particle Physics, Astronomy and Nuclear physics communities in the UK as well as to industry partners.

2) Working on co-design projects with industry partners to improve future generations of hardware and software.

3) Development of new techniques in the area of High Performance Data Analytics which will benefit industry partners and researchers in other fields such as biomedicine, biology, engineering, economics and social science, and the natural environment who can use this new technology to improve research outcomes in their areas.

4) Share best practice on the design and operation of distributed HPC facilities with UK National e-Infrastructure partners.

5) Training of the next generation of research scientists of physical scientists to tackle problems effectively on state-of-the-art of High Performance Computing facilities. Such skills are much in demand from high-tech industry.

6) Engagement with the general public to promote interest in science, and to explain how our ability to solve complex problems using the latest computer technology leads to new scientific capabilities/insights. Engagement of this kind also naturally encourages the uptake of STEM subjects in schools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>400000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P002307/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B43E1E82-2962-4C36-87AD-95AC01BE0A9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9C124926-5968-486F-9B51-CCEB6C4E9650</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6EE6184F-4A3C-4A99-A3AC-55FC62120A44</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Computational Methods &amp; Tools</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EE2392F-9964-4A0B-8C0A-1672FD744F8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Extra-Galactic Astron.&amp;Cosmol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC478D98-EB7D-4905-B536-D9D61AFD07E4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Galactic &amp; Interstellar Astron</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6D4F9380-A853-4602-9383-3E0067A53A84</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stellar Astronomy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
