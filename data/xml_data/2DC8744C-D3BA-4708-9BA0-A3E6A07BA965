wilderness areas</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/L019035/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Boundary areas between different populations are the crucial places where pathogens spill over from one population to the other, and present a key risk for the emergence of new pathogens, or invasion by existing pathogens. An important example of this type of boundary are the edges of wilderness areas, where pathogens present naturally in wild animals can spill over to infect people and livestock living in the surrounding areas. In sub-Saharan Africa, this scenario often affects human populations with few economic resources. The proximity of vulnerable populations to areas harbouring pathogens provides a technical and moral challenge: how can biodiversity and economically productive wilderness areas be preserved without threatening the health and livelihoods of vulnerable people? 
 
Our proposal will study the interaction between humans, livestock and wildlife and the role of this transition zone in the transmission of trypanosomes at the edge of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. These single-celled parasites are transmitted by the bite of tsetse flies. They do not cause any overt disease in wild animals within the Park, but humans bitten by tsetse infected with a particular species of trypanosome can develop sleeping sickness, a potentially fatal disease for which there is no preventative vaccine or drug. Other species of trypanosome also present in wild animals can cause a wasting, and ultimately fatal, disease in livestock. 
 
Tsetse flies are highly mobile and can move from their natural habitat within the park to infect humans and livestock in surrounding areas. In east and southern Africa, the species of tsetse that transmit trypanosomes usually feed on wild animals rather than humans. However, changing housing and farming practices reduce the availability of wild hosts to tsetse and increase the risk of humans being bitten by infected flies. It is estimated that 12 million people in east and southern Africa are at risk of sleeping sickness and the preservation of wilderness areas present a chronic and intractable source of infection. 
Preliminary data suggest however that there are restricted hotspots of disease risk, particularly at the edges of national parks, and that the application of modern methods of tsetse control to these hotspots will eliminate sleeping sickness foci. 
 
To assess whether focussed control of tsetse is effective, we will develop mathematical models of the transmission of trypanosomes in the transition zone from wildlife-dominated areas on the park boundaries through to livestock-dominated areas outside the parks. The models will enable us to predict the likely extent, duration and cost of interventions required to interrupt the transmission of trypanosomes at boundary areas. 
 
Parameter values for the models will be obtained using a combination of existing and new data on (i) the distribution, abundance, structure and infection status of tsetse populations, (ii) the densities of wildlife and livestock hosts, (iii) the number of livestock infected with trypanosomes, (iv) the composition and population genetics of the trypanosome populations and (v) the vegetational changes that occur at the boundary of the Serengeti National Park. The models will be validated by comparing the observed and predicted patterns of infection in the study area. 
 
We will then use the models to predict the likely impact of various control interventions, and identify which are the most appropriate control measures for livestock keepers, NGOs and government agencies concerned with controlling trypanosomes at different distances from the boundaries of protected areas. The project's outputs will assist Tanzania and other countries affected by tsetse-borne trypanosomiases to develop cost-effective strategies for managing diseases at the transition zone between wildlife-protected and livestock-keeping areas.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The zoonotic form of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense transmitted by tsetse flies. At the edge of wilderness areas, domestic cattle replace natural wild hosts (such as warthog and buffalo) as the principal reservoir host. We hypothesize that this shift towards a livestock-dominated system increases community reservoir potential and risk of human disease. Combining a wealth of ecological knowledge on the Serengeti ecosystem with new empirical data and models of HAT, we will quantify the transmission of trypanosomes across the ecotone between wilderness and settled areas and identify cost-effective strategies to interrupt transmission of HAT in the Serengeti and other wildeness areas of Africa. 

To achieve this goal, we will:- 

1: Develop novel models of the transmission of Rhodesian HAT which are spatially and temporally dynamic, thereby enabling us to model how the transmission of trypanosomes changes with the density, distribution and diversity of hosts and vectors. 

2: Quantify the density, structure and feeding patterns of tsetse populations to test empirically the hypothesis that contact rates between host and vector species changes between wilderness and settled areas.

3: Identify and genotype trypanosomes from wild hosts, cattle and vectors to test empirically the hypothesis that the prevalence, population make-up and diversity of trypanosome populations changes across the ecotone and results in a greater risk of Rhodesian HAT. 

4: Combine novel models (1) with empirical data (2,3) to identify 'ecologically smart' strategies to control human and animal trypanosomiasis in the Serengeti. The outputs will provide local, national and regional stakeholders with robust recommendations on cost-effective strategies to control human and animal trypanosomiasis in the wider Serengeti ecosystem and generate guidance on monitoring and managing Rhodesian HAT in wilderness areas.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will lead to more effective control strategies for reducing human African trypanosomiases (HAT). The potential economic and societal impacts include:-

Reduced incidence of HAT 
HAT is endemic in 171000 km2 of sub-Saharan Africa, imposing an annual health burden of 0.6M DALYs. A global programme to eliminate HAT by 2020 is based on active screening and case treatment. This approach is ineffective against Rhodesian HAT, the zoonotic form of the disease which threatens ~12M people, particularly those living in or near wilderness areas where reservoir hosts and tsetse are abundant. We will identify cost-effective strategies to improve control of Rhodesian HAT foci through tsetse or livestock focused interventions. The main beneficiaries will therefore be people living near wilderness areas.

Reduced burden of animal trypanosomiasis 
The outputs from this project will also be used to improve efforts to control African Animal Trypanosomiasis which kills &amp;gt;1 million cattle a year across 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Cheap and effective methods of tsetse control will also reduce the ~$35M spent annually by livestock keepers on trypanocides in Africa. Tanzania has the third largest livestock population in Africa, and a high proportion of poor livestock keepers; &amp;gt;4 million cattle are threatened by trypanosomiasis. Increasing animal productivity is likely to impact particularly on the rural poor, both in Tanzania and other affected countries. 

Improved cost-effectiveness of strategies to control HAT in Tanzania and sub-Saharan Africa 
In 2010-11, 48000 insecticide-treated targets were deployed to control tsetse in Tanzania, including 10000 specifically to control HAT in the Serengeti. Outputs from this project will ensure that these resources are deployed for maximum effect. Government, NGO, international (AU-PATTEC, WHO, FAO) and donor (DFID, BMGF) organizations concerned with controlling HAT will have more cost-effective options and decision support tools, provided via engagement workshops and online resources. The role of TTRI (project partners) as advisors to the Tanzanian Government on tsetse control, and our close links with the Ministry of Livestock Development and Fisheries, will ensure that project outputs reach policy makers to impact on future tsetse control plans. In particular, outputs from this project will contribute to the design and implementation of a programme to control trypanosomiasis over 15000 km2 of the Serengeti ecosystem being developed jointly by PATTEC and the governments of Kenya and Tanzania with support from BADEA. 

Robust tourism industry 
Tourism is a significant contributor to the Tanzanian economy and maintenance of wilderness areas as attractive and safe destinations is crucial. Even low numbers of HAT cases in tourists can have a significant impact on tourism. Preventing outbreaks of HAT is therefore important for both public and private sectors. This project will help to ensure that managers of protected areas have access to information on optimal tsetse control strategies. 

Environmentally sensitive approaches 
Tsetse and trypanosomiasis control can impact on non-target species and contribute to the development of drug and acaricide resistance. This project will promote strategies with negligible environmental impact, of particular importance in UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as Serengeti. 

Improved capacity for trypanosomiasis research in Tanzania 
The partnership of TTRI with world leading UK institutions will support the development of Tanzanian research in areas such as genetic analyses and mathematical modelling. 

We will maximise this impact via three impact pathways:
1) Provide information to assist local decision making in the Serengeti area.
2) Contribute to a national trypanosomiasis control strategy for Tanzania.
3) Contribute to regional tsetse control initiatives.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>612099</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Research Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Tanzania, United Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>TTRI</gtr:description><gtr:id>7AD010EC-FD70-4AC2-B587-382FEB881FE4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None to date (24 February 2016)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Field-based studies of tsetse</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Field- and laboratory-based investigations of tsetse</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Stellenbosch</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>SACEMA</gtr:description><gtr:id>4D2A3FE3-B476-4E51-9732-BF46C37DD1C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publications (see Publications Outputs)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Development of models of tsetse populations.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Field- and laboratory-based investigations of tsetse.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Edinburgh</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>The Roslin Institute</gtr:department><gtr:description>Roslin</gtr:description><gtr:id>B913131F-5D56-4265-96AA-C012FD00D801</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-authored papers (see publications outcome)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Conducting field- and lab-based investigations of trypanosomes</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Conducting field- and lab-based investigations of tsetse</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>SRUC</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>SRUC</gtr:description><gtr:id>5347E7B4-BB6A-4CBC-82D2-C34FD720B626</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See joint papers in Publications Output</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Field- and laboratory-based investigations of trypanosomes</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Field- and laboratory-based investigations of tsetse</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PATTEC meeting, Zimbabwe</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7B812F0B-7C62-415E-B1F4-234867BD511B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>November 2015: Vale led a field-based workshop on various aspects of the control of tsetse and trypanosomiasis, arranged as part of the 13th Meeting of the PATTEC National Coordinators/Focal Points (Harare &amp;amp; Urungwe District, 24-27 November 2014).

The participants represented a range of disciplines - epidemiology, physiology, evolutionary ecology and mathematical biology - and included new tsetse researchers through to those who have been in the field for nearly 50 years.

The workshop was funded through the WHO/TDR/IDRC programme: Human African Trypanosomiasis: alleviating the effects of climate change through understanding human-vector-parasite interactions and, accordingly, there was a considerable emphasis on the effects of climate, and particularly temperature, on the population dynamics of the vectors and the parasites. The event was a &amp;quot;workshop&amp;quot; in the true sense of the word, with half of the second day, and large proportions of the last three days, being given over to break-out sessions where the participants formed ad hoc groups to work on problems of mutual interest. This provided the particularly important opportunity for the four graduate student attendees to interact with each of the more senior researchers.

The centrality of climate to the proceedings was emphasised by UCT's Lisa van Aardenne's analysis of data from Rekomitjie Research Station, in the Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe, where meteorological records have been produced almost continuously over the past 57 years. That analysis showed a very clear increase in temperature over the period and Glyn Vale showed that these temperature increases, linked to some extreme events, have been associated with declines of 80-98% in the tsetse populations around Rekomitjie. Vale's Excel simulation studies produced results consistent with a causal link between the meteorological events and declines in tsetse populations. It was suggested that the further increases in temperatures predicted for the next few decades will cause the tsetse populations at Rekomitjie to disappear, with G. pallidipes going before G. m. morsitans. The climate on higher ground in Zimbabwe will become more suitable for tsetse.

A variety of other modelling techniques were on display. Roux-Cil Ferreira presented a brave attempt to develop an agent-based approach to the modelling of a very large mark-recapture data set from Zimbabwe. Furthermore, differential equation modelling techniques, applied both to tsetse and trypanosome biology, were presented by Rachid Ouifki, and the graduate students Nada Abdelatif, Spencer Fox, Tokpa Jamah and Zinhle Mthombothi, most often using data from Zimbabwe. Similarly, in the east African context Paul Bessell modelled trypanosome dynamics in wild hosts, and Kat Rock gave two presentations on different aspects of modelling trypanosomiasis dynamics and control in countries like the DRC. Of particular importance in her presentations was the indication that vector control using simple, affordable &amp;quot;tiny targets&amp;quot; could be game changing in the battle against Gambian trypanosomiasis.

Sinead English, meanwhile, considered the consequences of maternal effects for tsetse population dynamics, trypanosome epidemiology and the evolutionary responses of tsetse to environmental change. John Hargrove provided an analysis of age specific trypanosome prevalences found in tsetse at Rekomitjie. He also made a presentation on behalf of Sarah Ackley (UCSF), who was unable to attend the workshop, but who has developed a differential equation modelling approach that promises to provide improved estimates of adult tsetse mortality from ovarian dissection data. Jennifer Lord presented work carried out both in Zimbabwe and Tanzania, addressing tsetse and trypanosome population dynamics in areas at the edge of wildlife areas and asking questions about the relationship between vector disease and host densities.

Given the large body of field work that has been carried out in Zimbabwe on tsetse and trypanosome biology, and on the development there of methods for the control of the vectors and the disease, there was a considerable emphasis during the workshop on the analysis of results from Zimbabwe and of application of models to those data. Stephen Torr reminded the meeting, however, that the biology of the riverine Palpalis group tsetse, and Gambian human sleeping sickness, typical of West Africa, present problems entirely different from those seen in eastern and southern Africa, both for the modeller and for the people tasked with controlling trypanosomiasis. In this regard his talk and Kat Rock's provided details of the exciting prospect that the use of insecticide-treated &amp;quot;tiny targets&amp;quot; provide a real prospect of speeding up the elimination of Gambian sleeping sickness in Africa.

Finally, John Terblanche provided an entirely new and refreshing approach: viewing tsetse population dynamics through the lens of ecological energetics. He considered evolutionary trade-offs, links to other traits, such as water loss and reproductive output, and asked how we might integrate key traits of energetics into population dynamics models. The enthusiastic reception of his ideas by the meeting typified the open spirit of the workshop and gives hope that the event will spur serious advances in the near future in the analysis of tsetse and trypanosome populations and in the further development of improved, economical, eco-friendly techniques for disease control. The workshop has already given rise to new connections and collaborations, kicking off with a joint article currently being written by the participants, and a hope for an early reconvening of the group.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://sacemaquarterly.com/conferences/tsetse-trypanosomiasis-modelling-workshop.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>COCTU meeting, Uganda</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07F930F8-8174-4748-B9D1-AC57E4E11BD3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>March 2015: Andrew Hope (LSTM) made a presentation on vector-based interventions against HAT at the COCTU partners meeting in Kampala (30 March 2015).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ZELS launch meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6CC852E7-AB1B-474A-9B0F-EDF1903CE7A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>December 2015: Byamungu, Mramba and Torr attended the launch meeting of the ZELS programme in Arusha (9-14 December) and made presentations on the objectives and activities of the project to Tanzanian stakeholders, including local authorities, research and policy stakeholders.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Annual meeting of the ZELS and ZELS-AS programme at the Nelson Mandela Institute for Science and Technology (NMIST), Arusha, Tanzania</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>789B8F60-A3EE-41E3-9663-B1B38BD3472C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a four day meeting of the ZELS projects and the associated ZELS PhD students (ZELS-AS).

Dr Jennie Lord, a post-doctoral researcher on this project, received funding from the Vector BiTE RCN to attend the inaugural meeting in Clearwater, Fkorida, USA.

The goal of the network is:-

The goal of the Vector Behavior in Transmission Ecology Research Coordination Network (VectorBiTE RCN) to increase interaction between researchers in the diverse fields studying VBDs, to encourage collection and consolidation of key data, and to encourage development of analytical tools to better understand the role of vector behavior in transmission ecology.

The RCN will meet the overall goal by pursuing four main objectives:

 The development of theoretical models that include more details of vector behavior and heterogeneity;
Improved data collection and statistical methods to enable such models to be confronted with data;
Development of comprehensive and freely available parameterization and validation datasets to allow testing of methods and comparison between proposed models in a transparent fashion;
Training young researchers to apply these new tools and models as they are developed.
We will facilitate the development of new transmission models and their integration with empirical data using cutting edge quantitative methods to better understand the processes that drive transmission patterns in vector borne diseases. We will bring together specialists in vector behavioral ecology, epidemiology, theoretical ecology, mathematics, and statistics to promote open exchange of ideas, data, and tools to tackle this problem. Network participants will include a diverse group of researchers working on vector- borne disease working in systems across human, animal, and plant systems, ranging from relatively simple single host/vector/pathogen systems to complex systems with multiple hosts/vectors/pathogens, and varying in transmission environment (agricultural, rural, fragmented, and urban).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://vectorbite.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9960</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Scottish Funding Council - Universities Innovation Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>SRUC</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>EED628B9-BFA4-4A62-9D3F-7AF1488E306D</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project started on September 1 2014.
