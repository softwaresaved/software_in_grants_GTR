But for a cell to divide into two requires that the genetic material within that cell is copied. This allows both daughter cells to inherit a complete copy of the genetic blueprint. Without this blueprint a cell cannot function correctly and will die ultimately. Unfortunately, copying the genetic material of a cell is a very complex process, in part because there is a huge amount of DNA needed to carry the genetic code of even a simple organism such as a bacterium. The complexity of this process, and its critical importance, has led to the evolution of very complex cellular machines that can duplicate the large amounts of DNA found in cells. These cellular machines can copy the DNA very rapidly and very accurately. However, we now know that these machines are not perfect and often break down whilst trying to copy the genetic code. Why do they break down? One major problem is damage to the DNA caused by certain chemicals in the environment and also by radiation such as ultraviolet light from the sun. But another problem might be caused by the cell itself. The DNA carrying the genetic code does not actually exist in isolation within the cell but is completely coated in molecules called proteins. These proteins are essential for nearly every process within the cell and so a conflict exists between the necessity for these proteins and the need to copy the DNA. Our own, and others', work has demonstrated that these proteins can stop the DNA from being copied. We have recently discovered that certain enzymes within a cell (called DNA helicases) might help during duplication of DNA by facilitating the movement of DNA copying machines through protein-DNA complexes. This study aims to establish whether these enzymes do promote copying of DNA and what features of these enzymes are needed for such a function. This will be achieved by studying these enzymes in isolation and also within the context of the cell. These studies may help us to understand how cells duplicate their genetic material in the face of many potential blocks. Blockage of DNA copying is potentially catastrophic for a cell. Failure to copy the DNA prevents a cell from dividing to give two viable daughter cells. But blockage can also lead to errors during this DNA copying process. These errors can cause mutations and consequent malfunctions in daughter cells. In complex organisms, including humans, these malfunctions can take the form of genetic diseases and the onset of cancer. Our work will help understand how these risks might be minimised.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In vitro studies of DNA replication have illuminated the molecular mechanisms required for this complex process. But these biochemical approaches have analysed replication largely in isolation from other DNA metabolic processes. Recent work suggests that conflicts are inevitable between the DNA replication machinery and other proteins bound to the template during genome duplication. Such conflicts, if not resolved, may lead to cell death or the generation of genome instability. Our own work has highlighted the relative ease with which replication forks reconstituted in vitro become blocked upon encountering proteins bound to the template. But this ease of blockage is not reflected in vivo, suggesting that mechanisms exist to promote replication of protein-bound DNA. We have identified two E. coli helicases, Rep and UvrD, that may promote replisome movement through model protein-DNA blocks. Moreover, this underpinning of replisome movement may be essential for viability. We aim to establish whether Rep and UvrD do promote fork movement in E. coli and to determine what general properties are required in a helicase to function in this capacity. These aims will be addressed by assaying a range of DNA helicases for promotion of replisome movement in vitro and testing for correlation between this in vitro activity and the ability to complement the lethality of E. coli cells lacking both rep and uvrD genes. The size and diversity of nucleoprotein replication blocks that can be overcome by these activities will also be analysed. We will also use a model in vivo protein-DNA replication block to determine levels of replisome stalling in the presence and absence of Rep and UvrD helicases. Finally, we will also screen for interactions between Rep, UvrD and other DNA metabolism proteins. These studies will establish how replication of protein-coated DNA may be promoted without the need to invoke recombination and the accompanying dangers of genome instability.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>302284</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release (Gupta 2013 PNAS paper)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9DD0129B-C23B-4D72-8924-42391E1DFB0B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The University of York received several queries from media organisations.

We now know that one major reason for such mutations is the breakdown of the machines that copy all of the genetic material inside a cell prior to that cell dividing into two daughters. However, the causes of these breakdowns are still unclear. Our previous BBSRC-funded project (BB/C008316/1) demonstrated that proteins unavoidably bound to the DNA can block progress of these copying machines in the bacterium E. coli, a powerful model organism for studying these highly conserved processes. This previous project also demonstrated that two enzymes in E. coli, Rep and UvrD, can each promote copying of DNA that is encrusted with proteins. These enzymes are both helicases, a class of motor enzymes that move along DNA.The key findings of this current project are:1) Rep, not UvrD, acts to promote copying of DNA inside a normal cell. Rep functions in this capacity as an accessory replicative helicase due to a direct physical interaction with a key component of the DNA copying machinery. This component, DnaB, is also a helicase and so our work has demonstrated for the very first time that two molecular motors can cooperate in tandem during copying of the genetic material.2) absence of an accessory replicative helicase attached to the copying machinery results in significant slowing of the copying process inside cells.3) the most significant source of protein roadblocks to the DNA copying machines are complexes associated with &amp;quot;reading&amp;quot; the genetic information. This finding demonstrates that two essential processes, copying and reading of the genetic information, are in direct conflict inside cells. Given the conservation of these two processes in all life on the planet, our work has uncovered a key source of problems in copying of the genetic material.4) a critical requirement for promoting movement of the DNA copying machinery along protein-coated DNA is that two motors cooperate within the copying machinery by moving along opposing DNA strands, a requirement that may be a universal feature of the copying process in all organisms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings have revealed how organisms ensure that DNA is copied even when coated with proteins. This work has provided the first mechanistic information on the systems that underpin replication of protein-bound DNA and has also revealed the frequency with which DNA copying machines break down due to proteins bound to the DNA. Evidence is now emerging that these are problems all organisms must overcome, implying that such breakdowns in the DNA copying process may contribute to genetic diseases and cancer. Understanding how organisms avoid these breakdowns, and what happens when these mechanisms fail, will therefore further our understanding of these processes in human disease.

It is still unclear how the enzymes we have identified in this study promote movement of the DNA copying machines along protein-bound DNA. How these mechanisms operate inside cells is also unclear, given the large amounts of DNA that must be copied inside even simple organisms. It is also critical that we understand why these underpinning mechanisms occasionally fail, leading to replication failure and rearrangements within the DNA.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>57A8D301-188B-4D14-A6AB-F75D85855485</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FBFE26BF-7A08-4BAB-BEEF-D3619A9C6AB0"><gtr:id>FBFE26BF-7A08-4BAB-BEEF-D3619A9C6AB0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Helicases that underpin replication of protein-bound DNA in Escherichia coli.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biochemical Society transactions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d3522eb1f11d774c9a36b59d7972dd92"><gtr:id>d3522eb1f11d774c9a36b59d7972dd92</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McGlynn P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0300-5127</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9AC1B1CD-B33B-4152-83A1-1DA69547690B"><gtr:id>9AC1B1CD-B33B-4152-83A1-1DA69547690B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interaction of Rep and DnaB on DNA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/374c02445200eb8a13c300a3b14ec079"><gtr:id>374c02445200eb8a13c300a3b14ec079</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Atkinson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6EC60981-14A7-42AA-96DF-C8FCF4F1FD12"><gtr:id>6EC60981-14A7-42AA-96DF-C8FCF4F1FD12</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rep provides a second motor at the replisome to promote duplication of protein-bound DNA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e105456caed9c6ebf4a413021e7607a6"><gtr:id>e105456caed9c6ebf4a413021e7607a6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guy CP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1097-2765</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9B0AF71C-68BD-4D6F-A58D-819FA0BA4DAC"><gtr:id>9B0AF71C-68BD-4D6F-A58D-819FA0BA4DAC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Localization of an accessory helicase at the replisome is critical in sustaining efficient genome duplication.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/374c02445200eb8a13c300a3b14ec079"><gtr:id>374c02445200eb8a13c300a3b14ec079</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Atkinson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B774462E-28CD-44F2-9567-3221CF9BFC8B"><gtr:id>B774462E-28CD-44F2-9567-3221CF9BFC8B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protein-DNA complexes are the primary sources of replication fork pausing in Escherichia coli.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c7d4bbf6ea6b084958b4af196d41fcf4"><gtr:id>c7d4bbf6ea6b084958b4af196d41fcf4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gupta MK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G005915/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
