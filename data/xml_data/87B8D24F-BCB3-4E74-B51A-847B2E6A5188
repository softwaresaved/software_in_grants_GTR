In 2014 there were estimated to be almost 70,000 LAC across the UK, with these numbers continuing to steadily increase each year. Of the 30,000 children who were new to looked after care in 2014, the majority were over the age of five years old and were placed in care services following significant abuse or neglect. Consequently, this population represents a sample of children who have experienced extreme, often prolonged, inter-personal trauma (referred to as complex trauma). Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the extensive trauma exposure, psychological outcomes for these children are some of the poorest of any group, with the majority meeting criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder. Broader outcomes are also poor: a minority successfully complete their schooling, they are at increased risk of exploitation/further abuse, and negative occupational and criminal justice outcomes are common in adulthood. At a societal level there is a substantial economic burden which further highlights the profound vulnerability of this group 

In sum, poor outcomes are the norm for LAC, presentations and needs are complex, and services to address these issues are extremely stretched. Given these considerations, an evidence-based framework is essential to ensuring that the support provided is appropriate, targeted and effective. Despite this, there is a surprising lack of robust research exploring how LAC's experiences of early complex trauma may impact on their outcomes and needs. While cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) provide a useful base for understanding the psychological impact of trauma, it remains to be established whether they can usefully be applied to children who have experienced complex trauma, often followed by continued instability and vulnerability. It also isn't clear whether trauma related cognitive processes also contribute to wider mental health outcomes that are common in this group (e.g., externalising behaviour). Understanding such processes is vital to developing targeted support for LAC, including ensuring the availability of appropriate psychological interventions, and crucially, the training of foster carers in how to support LAC. The wide ranging poor outcomes that are currently present in LAC highlight the urgent need to enhance current provision.

The overarching aim of the proposed research is to explore how trauma-related psychological processes (such as thoughts about the trauma or memory of the trauma) may link LAC's experience of complex trauma with their psychological outcomes, as well as their trauma-related support needs. This work would make a major contribution to an under researched area by: (1) providing a large-scale exploration of the broad trauma-related mental-health profiles of LAC in the UK and, in particular, the trauma-related psychological mechanisms related to such profiles. Such information is essential to developing an empirical framework for improving outcomes for children who have experienced complex trauma; (2) providing important information on how LAC's trauma-related mental health profile is associated with their quality of life, education and placement success; (3) providing an in-depth exploration of what LAC view as their current support needs in relation to their experience of trauma, as well as identifying barriers to obtaining that support; and (4) exploring how their foster carers (i.e., their primary means of support) view the child's trauma-related support needs and barriers to these needs being provided. 

Taken together this research would provide the urgently-needed framework for understanding the needs of LAC and thus provide the foundation necessary for improving training and interventions in relation to this population.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>LOOKED AFTER CHILDREN (LAC) SERVICES (INC. FOSTER CARERS and LAC): The key priority of LAC services is to meet the support needs of these children, particularly through providing training and support to foster carers. However, the evidence-base required to ensure these needs are being met remains scarce. This is particularly problematic given the large number of children with poor outcomes and the lack of funding and services to provide adequate support directly to the child. Information gathered from the proposed research would be hugely beneficial to LAC services, particularly in terms of identifying the most prominent support needs of these children and informing the training provided to foster carers, based on an empirically-driven framework. 

Of course, the ultimate aim is that the research will improve outcomes for LAC through facilitating better understanding and management of their trauma related mental health needs. 

CHILD &amp;amp; ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES (CAMHS): LAC have significantly higher rates of mental health disorders compared to other children, but LAC services report problems in accessing treatment via CAMHS. One reason for this is the difficulty understanding the presentation of LAC, particularly outside of an attachment framework. How complex trauma impacts the mental health profiles of these children, and by what psychological processes, is currently unclear, but this is essential information for mental health workers to adequately address the needs of the child. Thus, findings from the proposed research will be of particular relevance to CAMHS workers, providing better understanding of the psychological needs of LAC and also the essential framework for identifying (and targeting) the psychological mechanisms that are associated with their mental health. 

EDUCATION SYSTEM: Despite the wellbeing of LAC being a longstanding top priority in the Department of Education's manifesto (see Refs 46, 47) , there has been little change in the educational outcomes of this population. One reason for this likely stems from the lack of empirical evidence for the education system to build their knowledge of how to support the needs of LAC. The proposed research, particularly with its aim of exploring how the child's mental health profile is cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with educational outcomes, would provide a vital framework for workers within the education system to develop their understanding of the needs of these children. 

COMMUNITY: The issue of how services support our society's most vulnerable children is rightly highly topical, particularly following recent high profile cases of the failures of current systems to meet the needs of highly vulnerable children. Consequently, the proposed study, with its focus on identifying the needs and profiles of these children, particularly from their own perspective, would likely be of considerable interest to the broader community.

POLICY: Impact on policy is a key long-term impact goal of this research. Approximately &amp;pound;2.5 billion is spent on LAC each year (Ref 4), yet outcomes remain extremely poor. National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines have long highlighted the need for further research on this population to improve outcomes (Ref 8), thus findings from this research, and research that would be made possible by the development of the proposed framework, would be of high interest to policy around support for LAC and carers. 

ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES: Outcomes for LAC remain extremely poor in adulthood. Consequently, this research would also be of interest to these services through providing evidence of the identified needs and mental health profiles in childhood that may impact their mental health trajectory into adulthood.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183660</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N01782X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>24C2FD61-D899-497D-8F52-D8C590EAD745</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Child Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>544E9837-9640-4AAB-93EB-416962206DD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education and School</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
