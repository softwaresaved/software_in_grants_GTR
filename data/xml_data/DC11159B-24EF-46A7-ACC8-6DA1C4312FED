&lt;p>Our findings suggest a need for adapting the practices of clinical research to accord volunteers a more active role, with benefit both to the social well-being of the volunteer and the more effective conduct of research. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The meeting will create an opportunity for health service users, patient advocacy groups, research volunteers, civil servants, politicians, ethics committee leaders, industry, health professionals and other stakeholders to express their own priorities and expectations about the role of volunteers in research and the directions that policiy on participation should take.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In parallel we shall expand and remodel our existing project website to function as a continuing resource through which the debate generated at the workshop may be continued and its implications for policy and practice fully argued, and the too often overlooked&amp;nbsp; voice of the volunteers themselves gain expression.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31178</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Contributory influence on HRA policies concerning patient-volunteers and transparency over clinical trials/studies; promoting contacts between patient advocacy groups, hospital managers, researchers and research funders.

Here, macro was understood as the level of the social and political, including issues of 'the politics of clinical trials', the inequalities of power embedded in social structures, the assumptions and characteristics of systems of research governance, and the immense diversity of both clinical studies and research participants which made generalisation difficult. The micro level embraced the experience and expectations of the individual research participant (still a relatively underinvestigated topic), as well as the scrutiny of individual clinical studies which makes up much of the day-to-day work of research regulatory systems (via ethics committees), and patient or consumer liaison groups.



Recommendations for action at the microlevel included practical steps to enhance the role of patient and public/patient involvement groups, encouraging Ethics Committees and professional bodies to make feedback to participants a condition of their support, and emphasising the importance of working to develop good working relationships between researchers and participants. At the macrolevel the issues that Workshop participants agreed should have prominence were:

o Trust - including threats to trust, and managing the delicate balance between trust and regulation

o Gaps in regulatory systems - including attention to immediate issues of participants' but failing to address important social issues; variable scientific standards and lack of public involvement in commercial trials

o Bureaucracy - simplification of regulatory system starting from patient/participant view on what they need' proportionate review

o Knowledge-sharing - including (as now entering into UK Ethics Committee practice) patient-friendly information on available trials and information on trials with negative or inconclusive results.

o Patient choice - effects of social structures, national policies and clinicians' recruiting practices on patients' freedom of choice to participate or not in clinical research 

o Expansion of public, patient and participant involvement and influence (PPI) - covering both increasing the proportion of clinical studies benefiting from PPI, including laboratory studies, extending the PPI role into the broad strategic 'macrolevel' issues raised earlier, improving methods of evaluation and campaigning for adequate finance to cover partnership costs.



These action points are expected to be taken forward jointly or severally by organisations or individuals participating in the Workshop. Support for networking and an Information Resource are available on the website created as part of the workshop project at www.ucl.ac.uk/researchvolunteersforum</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To inform the deliberations of policymakers; ethic committees, and hospital management; to influence the practice of clinicians and support staff involved in 'human subject' research (eg by providing feedback on research results to participants, seeking feedback from participants, involving patients/public in study design; to encourage more attention to participant issues in patient and PPI groups. A detaiied list of action points was formulated at the Workshop and these are expected to be taken forward jointly or severally by organisations or individuals participating in the Workshop. Organisations represented included for example the National Research Ethics Service, the Department of Health, the major funding bodies, and various patient groups.



We have set up a website to facilitate and report on action.
