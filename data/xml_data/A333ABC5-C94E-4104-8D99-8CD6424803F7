Efficient Road Vehicles</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/P03117X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Modern vehicles fuel economy has been improved since 2010 by approximately 20% and this has been achieved through engineering advances that have led to engine efficiency improvements, reduction in vehicle mass, introduction of hybrids. Vehicle manufacturers have managed to meet the mandatory 2015 CO2 levels, however according to their current announcements they are all still away by 30% to 15% from the 2020/21 target of 95 g/km. Achieving the necessary additional fuel economy improvement for 2020 and beyond requires the introduction of other unconventional technological approaches.

Despite substantial improvements in the emissions control technologies for road transport, which have been resulted in improved air quality over the past decade, there are still significant air quality problems throughout the UK and the EU, especially in urban and densely populated areas
Exhaust gas fuel reforming is a technique that utilises the engine exhaust heat, H2O, CO2 and fresh fuel to produce H2 rich gas through the promotion of primarily endodermic reactions 
Fuel reforming for IC engine technologies has been discussed for years but has never been implemented. The combination of present challenges in the emission reduction requirements in road transport and the improved fuels quality in recent years provides a unique opportunity for a successful fuel reforming process to be utilized in the global aftertreatment market.

In the &amp;quot;first stage&amp;quot; (WP1) the fuel reformer will be designed and integrated within the engine exhaust to provide small reformate/H2 concentrations to the aftertreatment system when required. In the &amp;quot;second stage&amp;quot; (WP2) the fuel reforming catalyst will be amalgamated within the aftertreatment, into one novel compact integrated catalyst brick, designed using additive manufacturing techniques, to improve further response time to engine changes and emission and simplify its operation, costs, complexity and control. In addition to emission benefits, fuel economy improvements (taking into account the small quantity of fuel in the reformer to generate the required ppm of H2) in GDI and Diesel engine, though combinations of more efficient engine calibration, reduced pumping losses and the absence of disruptive aftertreatment control strategies (i.e. aftertreatment systems activity and regeneration achieved through the substantial use of fuel).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The automotive industry and supply chain are major economic and industrial forces in the UK and vehicles sales, is a synonym of a country's, continent's economic growth. By 2030, only in Europe it is estimated that 297 million vehicles will be on the road and the forecast for the total CO2 emission is 1022 million tons/year. World petroleum and other liquid fuels consumption is expected to rise by 38% by 2040, spurred by increased demand in the developing Asia, according to projections in International Energy Outlook 2014, released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Therefore research in more efficient technologies capable of reducing CO2 emissions is underway. The EU is the most foremost R&amp;amp;D investor with 41 billion euros spent in 2013, followed by Japan and US with 24 billion and 12.5 billion, respectively. Aftertreatment systems market is predicted to grow from &amp;pound;13 Billions to more than &amp;pound;18 Billion by 2020 with the UK bases catalyst companies such as the project partner Johnson Matthey, to potentially gain considerable share. The proposed programme of work has been planned to deliver catalytic technologies that promise to provide substantial reduction of emissions in road transport vehicles. The beneficiaries of our research will encompass industry, government agencies, policy-makers and research groups. By working with our established marketing, PR and dissemination colleagues, and through our leadership in mechanisms such as the Energy Research Accelerator a capital investment of &amp;pound;60million from Government capital funding, supported by an additional &amp;pound;120 million of co-investment secured by industry and academic partners will ensure the outcomes of the project are communicated effectively to our targeted audiences, namely the general public, academics and industrialists.

Impact on society: The project will contribute towards substantial reduction of emissions as well providing improvements in quality of life and health. As described in the Case Support more than 500,000 premature deaths are linked to pollution from vehicles. 

Impact on industry/economy: The UK industry could be the first to benefit; with existing strength in engine and vehicle production, catalyst and catalytic technologies manufacture and with expertise in advanced manufacturing, the UK is well positioned to exploit the technologies. Reducing power generation and transportation operating costs, which could reduce fuel prices and electricity, further benefiting the wider industrial and public community 

Impact on research community: 
Fuel reforming and CO2 utilisation in H2 production for use in road transport vehicle with the aim to reduce emissions and the use of fuels has attracted significant world-wide attention in recent year. In 2004 approximately 250 papers published and received just over 1500 citations while last year (2015) the number of publication increased to more than 550 receiving approximately 19,000 citations (Mimas Sept. 2016). 
The interdisciplinary expertise within the groups and the available facilities are enabling us to investigate and provide a complete study and to generate new knowledge on: i) the individual technologies (i.e. fuel reforming, reactor engineering) considered here, ii) technological interactions and synergies when work in a system, iii) their performance under real life situations. The project will train new highly skilled researchers in an area in which a skills shortage is forecast in the coming years, thereby also benefiting the academic and industrial research communities. The benefits of the project will be passed onto the research community, industry and the public, providing knowledge and contributing to the global strategy for sustainable cleaner energy production and utilisation. Furthermore, the performance data generated will be used to predict system efficiencies and lifecycle CO2 emissions, so establishing the broader low-carbon credentials of the reforming technologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>890289</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P03117X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C7829C5-FA2A-4084-834D-56F41F83E977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Combustion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
