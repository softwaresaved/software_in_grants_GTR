The proposal builds on the growing international consensus that heat capture, conversion and storage will become increasingly important in the move to a
low carbon energy system and our analysis that it is likely to play a pivotal role in providing cost effective energy storage options both at the very large centralized and small distributed grid-scales.

This revised version of the bid still covers the three categories in the original proposal, however to meet the reduction in funding to &amp;pound;1.7 million a significant reduction in the scale of the transition scale test platforms has been made. In addition, further discount arrangements are being negotiated with a number of
suppliers, which has enabled greater value from the investment)

The division of funds between categories is now
(A) Materials characterisation equipment for high grade heat storage materials (&amp;pound;0.536M)
(B) Bench scale test platforms for examining heat transfer, fluid flow and storage density (&amp;pound;0.297M)
(C) Transition scale test platforms giving insight into full scale system behaviours (&amp;pound;0.866M).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Recognising that the total portfolio of energy storage equipment infrastructure will necessarily be much broader than the tightly-focused equipment set requested here, the present consortium has not bid for a national energy storage centre. However, it both expects that such a centre will be established and that the facilities described here will form a key resource for that centre. As outlined in the overview, the equipment falls into three categories with the bulk of spend being on transition-scale platforms. To provide for maximum versatility, these platforms will be: (a) containerised where feasible, (b) fitted with standard-size interfaces and (c) fully described in documents made accessible to the national energy storage centre and published on dedicated consortium website. The proposed suite of equipment and demonstration facilities will be used to support the existing RCUK investments i-STUTE and IMAGES. In addition the PI and CO-I's will actively seek funding from sources including industry, DECC, RCUK, TSB and the Europe Union to support further research projects that will utilise these facilities. We currently have a number of existing PhD who will benefit from access to the new facilities, these facilities when established will allow research student numbers active in this important area to be increased. The cohort of 40 Students studying the Renewable Energy Systems Technology MSc at Loughborough will be encouraged to undertake projects utilising the new resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2024-01-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2555641</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper was presented at The UK Thermal Energy Storage Workshop 2016, Imperial College London</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>72F680DA-3BBE-4FD0-8ED6-FC88E0437E83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A paper on 'Compressed air energy storage system with integrated low-grade heat capture' was presented at the UK Thermal Energy Storage workshop, Imperial London.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://energysuperstore.org/esrn/event/the-uk-thermal-energy-storage-workshop-2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Solastor Conference - One day symposium on storage developments for solar energy grid-scale applications</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EFBB2E80-F450-4232-98C7-BE05A4638986</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Integrating Solar Thermal Capture with Compressed Air Energy Storage' was presented at the Solastorconference, a single-day conference that ran at Imperial College, London.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://solastor.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper presented at the 3rd Offshore Energy &amp; Storage Symposium,  MALTA: 13-15 July 2016  University of Malta</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>13855A37-4043-4B51-8D6A-DCE6FD7D90ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Focusing on energy storage and offshore renewables, OSES 2016 provides a platform for academics and industry from around the world to share the latest developments in technology, economics and policy, through presentations and networking sessions.

The analytical equipment for characterisation of thermal properties of materials and the larger scale thermal storage test facilities have been installed and are attracting interest from international and industrial visitors. PhD and MSc students will also benefit from access to these facilities. 

Details of the installed equipment are being disseminated at workshops and conferences on energy storage to promote interest and awareness of the available facilities. Tours of the established facilities have been given to academics and industry from both the UK and overseas.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>92F205C7-4121-4B4B-B781-3EDEE7417AC6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L018098/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
