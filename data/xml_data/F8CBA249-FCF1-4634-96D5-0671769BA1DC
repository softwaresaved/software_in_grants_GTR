Abstract:

Firstly, I will review our findings on the importance of body posture alignment when perceiving and interacting with conspecifics. While this type of alignment is rather implicit and automatic, it could impact on high level social cognition as suggested by effects of implicit mimicry in social psychology. Together with observations from developmental and comparative psychology, this led us to hypothesise that deliberate alignment in form of perspective taking, which has been proposed as a uniquely human capacity, might still be grounded within representations of the body. Indeed, we repeatedly observed effects of posture congruence on high-level perspective taking (PT), suggesting mental simulation of a body rotation as the underlying mechanism for (literally) &amp;quot;putting ourselves into someone else's shoes&amp;quot;. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data analysis so far revealed oscillatory signatures that converge within the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), suggesting TPJ as the locus where the observer's embodied mind is aligned with another's. This is further corroborated in a final paradigm, where we observed perspective taking (or mentalizing) during live interactive communication in the MEG. We observed mentalizing/perspective taking in TPJ areas that were co-activated and coupled with areas related to language, perception, and episodic (working) memory. Overall the presentation aims at providing a cross-section of the multiple levels on which humans implicitly or deliberately align themselves with others during social interaction and I hope to discuss with the audience to what extent such alignments might form the basis for empathy.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Multi-level alignment between self and others as reflected in behaviour and MEG</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>943F11E4-0A5B-4F80-8655-17F6ED168431</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited Seminar Speaker at the University of East Anglia.

Our data on culturally mediated gender differences are evidence for learned differences as opposed to inborn, hard-wired differences and therefore help changing existing stereotypes and prejudices. Our reserach has been showcased in BBC Horizon program.

In 2016 we have successfully secured a PhD scholarship together with the Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH) to investigate gender differnces in autism. This research will not only benefit academic outcomes but will feed directly into clinical practice of the Children and Adolescence Mental Health Services (CAMHS at BCH, Prof Ashley Liew).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>750DA17B-9C80-4776-980C-E3821C83C95D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our findings suggest that the two levels of perspective taking (VPT-1: &amp;quot;I know what you can- and cannot see&amp;quot;, VPT-2: &amp;quot;I know how the world looks like from your viewpoint&amp;quot;) are subserved by two very different default mechanisms (Kessler &amp;amp; Rutherford, 2010). While VPT-1 relies on simple judgements about what lies within another's line of sight (LoS), VPT-2 requires the simulation of a body rotation into another's viewpoint (eSR). 

Recruitment of these mechanisms is general and independent of response modality, i.e. verbal localisations vs. spatially mapped key-presses. Furthermore, both mechanisms generalise in principle across genders and cultures, yet, with systematic variations in relation to social skills and egocentric bias as reported in Kessler et al. (2014) and Kessler and Wang (2012). We found that genders are more different in western culture than in Chinese culture and that Chinese are faster VPT-1 perspective takers and show for VPT-1 an other-oriented bias in contrast to an egocentric bias in Westerners. 

MEG investigations (Wang et al., subm.) revealed that theta brain oscillations were more strongly modulated in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during eSR and in relation to proprioceptive, embodied as well as cognitive aspects of VPT-2 processing, suggesting TPJ as the locus where the observer's embodied mind is aligned with another's. We have now confirmed this role of right TPJ by means of a further TMS study (Wang et al., 2016) This was corroborated in a further MEG study (Boegels et al., 2014) that employed a live communication game where a speaker broke previously established naming conventions, thus, requiring the listener to engage VPT-2 for explaining the sudden violations. Theta oscillatory effects suggested that perspective taking in TPJ was systematically related to areas processing language, perception, and episodic memory. 

Finally, revealing the basic mechanisms of VPT allowed for theoretical innovations and computational models documented by 3 publications (Braithwaite et al., 2013; Miyachikov et al., 2014; Pezzulo et al., 2013) and one other paper on the relationship between perspective taking and out-of-body experiences (Kessler &amp;amp; Braithwaite, submitted).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will guide future research into how humans represent others they interact with. The main conclusion from our research is that humans simulate an alternative embodied self that forms the basis for simulating others, e.g. by imagining the alternative self in annotator's visuo-spatial, cognitive or socio-emotional context. We are currently working on a further theoretical paper that will explicitly state these conjectures making them available for empirical science and philosophy (collaboration with Steven Butterfill at Warwick University, Philosophy department).

Additionally, this new theoretical framework will inform research with individuals who are particularly challenged with respect to representing others in social situations, such as people diagnosed with autism. Robert Seymour is a PhD student (started October 2015) who is working on perspective taking and sensory processing in autism.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>932BE28A-ADD7-4007-9538-DBD2E6EDA188</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9E2406C8-85C2-4572-AC7B-86D127467AB7"><gtr:id>9E2406C8-85C2-4572-AC7B-86D127467AB7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Differently developed adults: Cultural similarities and differences in perspective taking mechanisms</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9bb676901e8602da97a19cd7786b4634"><gtr:id>9bb676901e8602da97a19cd7786b4634</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Klaus Kessler (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5C9196DB-E74D-4ADB-9D00-E5296A4F0A38"><gtr:id>5C9196DB-E74D-4ADB-9D00-E5296A4F0A38</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shared action spaces: a basis function framework for social re-calibration of sensorimotor representations supporting joint action.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in human neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d93971f4f21570d991792849625dc7ea"><gtr:id>d93971f4f21570d991792849625dc7ea</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pezzulo G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1662-5161</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/ECEA9BA5-7A45-4D95-8EB6-441BAD9E7E55"><gtr:id>ECEA9BA5-7A45-4D95-8EB6-441BAD9E7E55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Differently embodied transformations in visuo-spatial perspective taking</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9bb676901e8602da97a19cd7786b4634"><gtr:id>9bb676901e8602da97a19cd7786b4634</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Klaus Kessler (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DA5FE0FC-1B4F-4F97-8A29-FA00648AA757"><gtr:id>DA5FE0FC-1B4F-4F97-8A29-FA00648AA757</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Two Forms of Visuo-Spatial Perspective Taking are Differently Embodied and Subserve Different Spatial Prepositions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/76e238234f034df4737ff366aa695e59"><gtr:id>76e238234f034df4737ff366aa695e59</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kessler K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-1078</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5BB55DBD-F30C-421E-92A2-68672CFD08E6"><gtr:id>5BB55DBD-F30C-421E-92A2-68672CFD08E6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Posture effects on perspective taking as revealed by evoked and oscillatory responses in the MEG</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/34322888dfb980b23a47042321e02f43"><gtr:id>34322888dfb980b23a47042321e02f43</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hongfang Wang (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1538FB32-749F-4AC6-94CD-16605162167B"><gtr:id>1538FB32-749F-4AC6-94CD-16605162167B</gtr:id><gtr:title>TEST: a tropic, embodied, and situated theory of cognition.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Topics in cognitive science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/70570332e65608cf01598bbc299ba3c0"><gtr:id>70570332e65608cf01598bbc299ba3c0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Myachykov A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1756-8757</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/21AACFEE-FB5E-432B-9BAA-9E2BE25A0016"><gtr:id>21AACFEE-FB5E-432B-9BAA-9E2BE25A0016</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gender and autistic personality traits predict perspective-taking ability in typical adults</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Personality and Individual Differences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bbbbb910131cbe32ac144e1c1bdb69f4"><gtr:id>bbbbb910131cbe32ac144e1c1bdb69f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bruny?
