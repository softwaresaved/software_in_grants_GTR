Engineering applications range from the formulation of reliable fire-safety measures to the design of energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly internal combustion engines and gas turbines. The consortium will serve as a platform to collaborate and share HPC expertise within the research community and to help UK computational reacting flow research to remain internationally competitive. The proposed research of the consortium is divided into a number of broad work packages, which will be continued throughout the duration of the consortium and which will be reinforced by other Research Council and industrial grants secured by the consortium members. The consortium will also support both externally funded (e.g. EU and industrial) and internal (e.g. university PhD) projects, which do not have dedicated HPC support of their own.
The consortium will not only have huge intellectual impact in terms of fundamental physical understanding and modelling of turbulent reacting flows, but will also have considerable long-term societal impact in terms of energy efficiency and environmental friendliness. Moreover, the cutting edge computational tools developed by the consortium will aid UK based manufacturers (e.g. Rolls Royce and Siemens) to design safe, reliable, energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly combustion devices to exploit the expanding world-wide energy market and boost the UK economy. Last but not least, the proposed collaborative research lays great importance on the development of highly-skilled man-power in the form of Research Associates (RAs) and PhD students of the consortium members, who in turn are expected to contribute positively to the UK economy and UK reacting flow research for many years to come.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25740</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Developing and applying software AMROC for direct numerical simulations of fast flame with detailed chemical kinetics ;
2. The mechanisms on flame accelerations and deflagration-to-detonation transition: Based on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for reactive flow problems, an eigenvalue problem for the steady and self-sustained premixed combustion wave propagation is developed. The eigenvalue problem is analytically solved and a set of analytic formulae for description of the wave propagation is found. The analytic formulae are actually the exact solution of the eigenvalue problem in the form of integration, based on which an iterative and numerical algorithm for calculation of the steady and self-sustained premixed combustion wave propagation and its speed was developed. In order to explore the mathematical model and test the computational method, groups of combustion wave propagation modes were calculated. The computational results show that the non-trivial modes of the combustion wave propagation exist and their distribution is not continuous but discrete.
3. Investigation on transient flow of diffusion flames in compartment enclosures. Particular attention has been focus on the onset of flame oscillation through compartment openings. To support the high performance calculation and modelling, a number of experiments using gas, liquid, and solid fuels were carried out. The relationship between onset of flame oscillation and a number of parameters such as ventilation parameter, heat release rate were investigated. A empirical relationship for calculating the time from ignition to the start of flame oscillation were obtained. We are focusing on the intensive modelling. The results of this part of research is not published yet.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. By the end of the research work, a computational fluid dynamics software will be available for use in research work.
2. The research work on flame accelerations and deflagration-to-detonation transition will help to understand the mechanism and improve explosion simulation.
3. The low speed flame oscillation will improve understanding of fire spread in buildings such as fire spread through cavities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0B868BE5-E3F3-4ECF-9A41-F9B278F6424C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/10CD8208-32C4-4B28-B1B2-69277B9FF873"><gtr:id>10CD8208-32C4-4B28-B1B2-69277B9FF873</gtr:id><gtr:title>A theory for steady and self-sustained premixed combustion waves</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cogent Engineering</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c14bc14b523f46259b756e82875d7f82"><gtr:id>c14bc14b523f46259b756e82875d7f82</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Liu W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K036890/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
