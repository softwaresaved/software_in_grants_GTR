materials at all stages of the process. The research facilities of the Prof. Carole Perry's Biomolecular &amp;amp; Materials Interface
Research Group will be utilised in addition to the facilities within the School of Science and Technology to support the
development of the materials for commercial exploitation. As required, materials will be analysed to ensure that they meet
the requirements for proposed pharmaceutical and healthcare applications (e.g. British Pharmacopeia).
Material Collection and Pre-Processing
1. Evaluation/development of continuous collection methodologies, including:
Determination of variation in process critical factors such as organic content, water content, albumin and yolk
contamination of collected material, particle sizing.
Optimise transit and pre-processing stabilisation of raw material (storage time limits, temperature limits, concentration of
storage solution).
2. Evaluation/development of initial processing approaches:
Determine particle sizing resulting from different milling parameters (time, initial water content, milling speed) and develop
optimised milling parameters and QC methodology.
Determine powder properties resulting from different drying parameters (time, initial water content, drying speed) and develop optimised drying parameters and QC methodology.
Determine and check specification of processing raw materials e.g. site water supply, base and alcohol (trace metals
content, elemental profile and purity) and develop QC methodology for raw materials.
Analytical services to determine effectiveness of initial processing output (testing to British Pharmacopeia grade CaCO3).
Primary Processing
Iterative evaluation of different continuous processing approaches, conditions and materials
3. Evaluation of the influence of processing variables on process output:
Process; NaOH concentration, alcohol concentration/type (ethanol or isopropanol), position of milling in process (before,
during or after).
Process conditions; temperature, volume of treatment: mass of feed material ratio, time and mixing rate.
Materials; continuous monitoring of starting materials and end product in relation to the desired specification (testing to
British Pharmacopeia grade CaCO3). In addition intermediate stages in the process and the extent to which raw materials
can be recycled in the process will be monitored/evaluated as necessary.
QC methodology will be developed for the process.
Secondary Processing - Agglomeration
Iterative evaluation of different continuous agglomeration approaches
4. Evaluating the influence of processing variables on the agglomeration process:
Influence of processing on particle/agglomerate size including coating thickness and structure from the atomic
(crystallography) through to micro and macroscopic scales (microscopy) including particle and coating porosity.
Organic content of particles, influence on formulation pH and general composition (chemical and elemental [e.g. Fe, Al, Pb,
As, Cd, Hg and total heavy metals] analysis, purity of calcium carbonate, moisture content) using relevant analytical,
microscopic and spectroscopy methods.
Determine material compliance to any relevant regulatory standards pre and post-agglomeration.
Comparative studies will be conducted with at least 3 competitor materials.
Combination of process steps to demonstrate process complementarity
NTU will support AvGo in evaluating the process developed to date though analytical testing of product output to check
conformity, e.g. testing to British Pharmacopeia grade CaCO3, and providing guidance in the event of any compliance
issues detected.
NTU will also assist in consolidation of process operations, evaluating opportunities to file for new intellectual property and
composition of the final project report.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Project beneficiaries
The project aims to generate &amp;gt;&amp;pound;30m in direct revenues for the project partners within 5 years of project completion,
creating &amp;gt;50 direct jobs and significantly reducing the negative economic and environmental issues associated with current
disposal of waste egg shells (~15,000 tonnes disposed/year in the UK, costing &amp;gt;&amp;pound;500k/year in landfill/haulage). The project
will also lead to ~&amp;pound;1.6m in further UK investment in R&amp;amp;D/manufacturing.
Beneficiaries outside of the project consortium
In addition to commercial benefits to Avgo and its project partners, other beneficiaries from this project include (within 5
years of project completion):

A) Local Suppliers: anticipation that project outputs will contribute to ~&amp;pound;1.6m in additional revenue (incl. distribution) for
local, E.Midlands suppliers with the creation of ~12-15 additional roles

B) Egg processors: ~&amp;pound;950k cost savings for egg processors, enhancing their European competitiveness and supporting
further investment.
Also, it's expected that processors' compliance with key customers' corporate social responsibility policies with lead to
~&amp;pound;2.4m/year in additional revenues

C) Food and Pharmaceutical product manufacturers: In addition to reduced raw material transportation costs, potential UK
manufacturer benefits include a reduction in downstream process costs e.g. ~15-20% reduction in &amp;quot;filler- binder&amp;quot;
ingredients required to form quality tablets via direct compression due to use of customised ACC grades.

D) Employees: the improved, sustainable processing of waste egg shell material will improve employee health and safety at
both primary (reduced biohazard) and secondary processors (reduced processing dust; exposure to contaminates
associated with alternatives e.g. Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC)).

E) Consumers: the end product will use a higher purity raw material with improved bioavailability, benefitting the consumer.
Displacement of inorganic PCC by egg shellill also lead to reduced consumer exposure to heavy metal
contamination and product quality issues that have been associated with PCC.
This has the potential to improve consumer confidence, driving product adoption through repeat sales and improved
product compliance/use, leading to consumer quality of life improvements and reduction in conditions associated with
insufficient calcium intake, including osteoporosis: Calcium supplementation/fortification with eggshell-derived CC has been
proven to improve bone health (bone mineral density (BMD) and resistance to fractures).

F) Environmental beneficiaries: the consortium anticipates halving the UK costs and volumes of current waste egg shell
disposal within 5 years of project completion (and, through technology licensing, also significantly reducing EU volumes). It
also expects to displace PCC production from mined limestone (negative environmental impact including aesthetics and
generation of waste gas, effluent streams and CO2).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147203</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>50000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>viability of obtaining biopharmaceuticals from eggshell waste</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>PoC15_06</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>AD1A65E2-3349-4423-860E-B1D9DB2135E2</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A COLLECTION PROCESS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED TO COLLECT, DECONTAMINATE AND TRANSPORT EGGSHELL BY-PRODUCTS TO A SITE OF PROCESSING.
