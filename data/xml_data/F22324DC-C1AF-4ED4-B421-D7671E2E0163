The day-to-day lives of those living with dementia is incredibly complex and current health and social care provision may not be best able to meet their needs (Alzheimer's Society 2012). Contemporary policies aim to empower people with choices and resources, quite different to earlier ideas in which risk was understood as something to be controlled and limited. This move from managing 'vulnerable people' (through an emphasis on safety and loss) to managing vulnerable situations is evident in the contemporary language used such as 'risk enablement', 'positive risk taking', 'reasonable risk', and positive risk in practice models such as personalisation. 

Our recent completion of Healthbridge, the evaluation of innovative and empowering services recommended by the National Dementia Strategy for England (DH 2009) has generated a large volume of data from people living with dementia (Clarke et al 2013). In total, 239 interviews were completed (lasting 45-120 minutes) with 47 people with a diagnosis of dementia and 54 carers interviewed on up to three occasions. This is the largest data-set of interviews with people with dementia and carers that can be found.

We aim to interrogate this existing qualitative dataset in partnership with those living with dementia, using an approach that sets out to challenge assumptions of current practice to inform the development of empowering support for people living with dementia.

To achieve this aim, our objectives are to:
1. Interrogate through secondary data analysis a large qualitative data-set of interviews with people living with dementia using two theoretical frameworks that will inform our analytical process: risk and resilience, and the ethic of care. 
2. Collaborate with people living with dementia in the co-production (interpretation) of knowledge and the co-production of digital stories which re-present experiences within the data set.
3. Working with partners to influence practice and services to ensure that the work impacts on the development of services and support through briefing papers, digital stories, a blog and a good practice guide. 

The project will be a process of co-production between academic researchers and non-academic partners, acknowledging the varied yet equally valuable knowledge/ experience bases involved in the process. There will be two key aspects to the work - identification of theory from the existing dataset, and participation with people with experience of dementia. These link together, enabling people living with dementia to be part of the process of analyzing the data.

Partners in the work are the Mental Health Foundation and Alzheimer Scotland. We will work together to develop a relationship with four groups of people with dementia and their carers, who will then shape the emerging findings from the secondary analysis of the data-set. Together with people living with dementia, we will create digital stories which combine individual experiences and the analysed data. These will be central to two workshops with people who influence policy and practice in dementia care.

In order to have the greatest influence of the work, we will communicate throughout and after the duration of the project with a wide academic and non-academic audience through a website, blog commentary, briefing papers and a good practice guide. The collaboration between the Mental Health Foundation, Alzheimer Scotland and the University of Edinburgh creates a powerful combination of influence and access to the key policy and practice arenas to ensure longer term use of the findings across these sectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Central to ensuring impact is the powerful collaboration between the Mental Health Foundation, Alzheimer Scotland and Edinburgh University; this combination creates significant reach of influence and access to the key policy and practice arenas to ensure longer term use of the findings across these sectors. 
There will be direct benefits for the partners involved, each of who are keen to use the lessons emerging from the project to inform future developments within their organisations and for the care they provide. The project specifically involves time dedicated to support the use of research within these partner organisations.

Beyond these direct partners, the project will also deliver significant benefits to the wider dementia health and social service sectors and to carers supporting people with dementia, by contributing to their understanding of how to improve life for people with dementia. It is expected that, across the dementia field, practitioners, service providers and policy-makers, will specifically benefit from the findings, accessed through the briefing papers, the practice guide, the website and the 'challenging assumptions' events, which will feed into practice and policy debates around improving services for people with dementia. The impact of this learning on the wider social service sector will be maximised through the involvement of the project partners, both of which can utilise their remit and involvement to further maximise the sharing and use of knowledge generated through this project across the UK. Impact will further be maximised through the project website, and the dissemination of findings through existing newsletters, social media channels, events and contacts. All publications will be made available via project and partner websites, and highlighted via a range of dissemination channels, including relevant communities of practice, 

The methodological findings from the work will have direct benefit to academia and to wider understanding of the use and usefulness of secondary qualitative analysis as a mechanism for improvement and innovation. In particular, dementia researchers will gain through improvements in their understanding of the experience of living with dementia and the importance of peer support within a framework of resilience. Beyond subject specific benefit there will be wider implications gained from the 'Challenging methodologies' work and from sharing our methodological findings in a way that will allow others to challenge assumptions around participatory qualitative analysis. This impact will be achieved through the briefing paper on methods and through at least two journal articles translating the innovative methods for involving people with dementia in data analysis and the theoretical findings from the analysis. These will contribute to academic debate around secondary data analysis of large qualitative data sets and also to our academic knowledge and understanding of qualitative analysis involving people with dementia (particularly across applied disciplines: social work, housing, nursing etc).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>163892</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a 40 minute physical theatre performance that communicates the themes generated in the research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E2F815FC-F389-48F7-8F37-9521D0868ABC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Ties that Bind premiered in Keswick Theatre on 1st March 2017 with very positive reviews including:

Excellent in giving an insight into dementia

Good show. Felt sympathy for the characters. Thought setting and music/visuals worked - Paul in his own environment rather than a nursing home. Favourite part was Paul's victory in finding his keys.

On a post-performance audience survey 74% of the audience agreed or strongly agreed with the following statements:

1. Watching The Ties That Bind has made me feel more compassionate towards people living with dementia 
2. Watching The Ties That Bind has increased my awareness and understanding of living with dementia 
3. I found watching The Ties That Bind comforting and reassuring

We developed new methods of participatory secondary data analysis, working alongside group of people living with dementia to analyse a large qualitative dataset derived from the national evaluation of the English National Dementia Strategy. 

The analysis was based on two theoretical perspectives: Douglas' Culture (or Group-Grid) Theory and Tronto's Ethic of Care. We used a 9-stage model of analysis that involved cycles of presenting, interpreting, representing and reinterpreting the data and findings between multiple stakeholders. In the spirit of reflexivity and an understanding of knowledge as a provocateur which can have multiple, contradictory viewpoints, the analysis process was designed to incite dialogue with a range of stakeholders and create a space for dialogue with those voices most often marginalized and silenced by the dominant presence and understandings of researchers. 

Conducting this innovative research required us to explore and develop an understanding of how to prepare the data, and how to work with people with dementia as partners (including attending to research ethics, determining how to present a large dataset to people with dementia in an accessible way, and questioning what data is).

2. We discovered that:
? Dementia and the effect it has on adhering to presumed but unspoken social expectations can lead to a gradual process of withdrawal of friends and withdrawing of oneself which culminates in social exclusion
? Peer support, which is underpinned by a different set of social expectations, can restore a sense of social inclusion and is beneficial for some people, but not everyone.
? More attention to the collective nature of care which includes peer support, families, communities and professionals, with people with dementia recognised as playing an active role within this network, could better support social inclusion. 
? New social expectations based on co-operative listening, co-operative action, and co-operative caring could lead to solidarity with people with dementia and a society where people with dementia can be included in community, social and public life.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have developed several outputs from the research that are designed to make the findings accessible to non-academic groups. These include a series of Briefing Papers and a digital film (titled Michael's Map). We held two 'policy and practice' workshops, one in London and the other in Edinburgh.

We have secured further funding from the ESRC Impact Accelerator Account held at the University of Edinburgh (2016/17) - this will allow more extensive ways of taking the findings forward through development of a live performance version of the film (titled Ties That Bind) and assessment of impact of the film and play.

In addition, we have presented the research at two conferences to date and will be focussing on developing academic papers.

The findings will increase awareness of the social group dynamics experienced by people living with dementia and may influence future policy and service delivery and well as family interpersonal relationships. There has already been international interest in the research findings and the research outputs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9C12F7A7-2E37-476A-80C0-FC7A7F0EE6DE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://talkingdementia.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We developed a novel method of working with people living with dementia in co-analysing a large qualitative dataset.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA14D6C7-5BFA-4B28-B8F0-637919DCBD1A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To date, we have presented this model in two workshops and at an international conference.
