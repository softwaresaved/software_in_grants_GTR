In this regard, African agriculture is particularly handicapped. The dairy supply chain was selected for the project because dairy is a key investment sector for the Government of Malawi, donors such USA, Japan and Belgium have focused part of their development aid on the sector, and despite this, domestic production response is still unimpressive and large part of the population do not have access to dairy products of nutritious and safe quality. In this context, the purpose of this project is to address some of the key challenges faced by the chain through an assessment of its operation that can help boost the potential contribution of the sector to economic growth and food security. The methodology of analysis involves several stages from exploring the operation of each one of the parts of the dairy supply chain, identifying problems and proposing solutions, to integrating the different results into a model that will allow simulating the impact of different policy alternatives. The project is multidisciplinary and builds on the existing academic link between SAC and Bunda College of Agriculture in Malawi.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will ultimately identify barriers that hamper the development of the dairy industry in Malawi, an industry that has the potential to have a positive impact on the income of smallholder farmers, on employment opportunities, food security outcomes, and overall performance of businesses that contribute to Malawi's GNP. 

In terms of the Millennium Development Goals we see this research as directly impacting goals 1 (i.e., eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) and 8 (i.e., develop a global partnership for development, particularly target 8B namely to address the special needs of the Least Developed Countries) as the development of the entire dairy supply chain will contribute to the income of the smallholder farmers and to their food security in a sustainable way. Furthermore, by identifying key barriers, it will help international development agencies to target cooperation funds according to the special needs of Malawi in an effective and efficient way. 

We anticipate that this research will have an impact in clarifying aid objectives in the dairy sector and potentially supply chains more generally. For instance, JICA supplied the Bvumbwe (Thyolo district) with a milk pasteuriser and a packaging machine in 2003 for the cooperative to sell milk directly to consumers and not through the major milk companies. Whilst this can have a positive impact for consumers in terms of food security (e.g., access to lower prices for safe milk), it also increases the degree of fragmentation and inefficiency of the supply chain, as dairy plants are operating with a high degree of unutilised capacity. A related issue is the discussion of whether the monetisation of milk powder as part of USAID's Programme of Food for Peace would distort the Malawian dairy domestic market (Fintrac Inc., 2008). On the one hand Fintrac Inc., in the report produced for USAID to provide guidance about what commodities should be monetised, states that selling milk powder to processors will expand their production and reduce their prices with obvious benefit to consumers. However, Land O' Lakes/Malawi, which works on a USAID programme to support the development of the dairy industry, and smallholder milk production in particular, makes it clear that it does not support milk powder for monetization due to its possible effects on the domestic market. The project will provide evidence to illustrate these contradicting impacts.

The research results in the form of briefings and presentations will be useful to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security and Ministry of Industry, Trade and Private Sector Development. The dairy supply chain falls under the jurisdiction of both ministries and a consistent policy needs to integrate the actions from both offices as the operation of supply chains has impact on the well-being of the agricultural sector and consumers. The research will contribute knowledge about the determinants of marketing milk to the informal sector and whether the processing sector operates in a competitive way. Furthermore, we anticipate that this type of analysis will also encourage similar research in other food supply chains. 

The results will be useful to other dairy sector stakeholders, including farmer associations and NGOs that support them, consumers, processors and traders associations. All will be informed by the results by means of presentations, discussions and briefings.

In terms of training, the project will transfer research skills to Malawian research collaborators in areas such as supply chain analysis and industrial organisation theory. Regarding the latter, many of the approaches used in industrial organisation have been applied to development economics creating an area known as development microeconomics (see for instance Bardhan and Udry, 1999). Another area will be in the use of econometric modelling of supply chain for the simulation of policies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>360377</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Malawi: building a sustainable dairy farming sector</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E0E2CDCC-EAA7-4D84-9C97-FDFD1AA4FE76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was part of ESRC Festival.

With better links farmers can sell and earn more; as well as access fertiliser, crop chemicals, veterinary supplies, tools and machinery. As agricultural supply chains develop, they create jobs and incomes for others in the rural economy. Hence a key question is how these supply chains can be made to work more effectively and equitably, for the benefit of farmers, consumers and all those working in the chains. This was the focus of the activity and it was attended by about 50 people some of which were practitioners (e.g., the head of the Kenya veterinary board), researchers, policymakers and media.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://degrp.squarespace.com/events-1/2016/10/28/economic-opportunities-for-a-better-future-leveraging-agriculture-innovation-and-financial-inclusion</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Market structure and coherence of international cooperation: the case of the dairy sector in Malawi</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D99D0F3-3423-4C25-8CBD-45E989B0508B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at the Pan-SAC seminar of the paper &amp;quot;Market structure and coherence of international cooperation: the case of the dairy sector in Malawi&amp;quot;

The logic of the project was based on the following facts according to the literature and available data up to early 2011 (when the project was formulated): (1) Underutilisation of processing capacity; (2) Use of imported reconstituted powder milk instead of domestic supplies; (3) A profitable processing sector targeting affluent urban population; (4) Poor quality milk leading to rejection by processors (17%); (5) Significant proportion of milk production sold as raw milk (i.e., through the &amp;quot;informal market&amp;quot;); (6) The lowest consumption of milk per capita in Africa (estimated at 4.7 kg/capita/year). (7) Donors have been contributing to the development of the sector for several years without significant results.

In the aforementioned context two major aims of the project were (1) to identify factors hampering the contribution of the sector to economic growth and food security and (2) to assess whether a strategy of revamping the existing formal dairy supply chain would be more effective than one promoting &amp;quot;short dairy supply chains&amp;quot; by investing in small-scale dairy marketing and processing facilities.

Major findings as regards aim (1) are:

(a) The project found significant differences in the production of milk at the farm level, with the Southern region being the most efficient and the Northern region the least efficient. This speaks well of the strategy of expanding mix breeds animals (mix of native zebus and pure breeds), which have lower milk yields per cow than pure breeds but also have lower costs.

(b) Marketing of milk suffers from issues regarding infrastructure, e.g., roads quality, electricity power cuts, quality of equipment and management at the milk bulking group (MBG) level. This affects not only the collection and the quality of the milk but also the returns of farmers, since the inefficiencies at the MBGs level are reflected in the price paid to farmers.

(c) The project did not find processors to have market power on both the buying and selling markets. On the buying side because of the size of the informal market where farmers can sell their products directly if they find processors' price too low. On the selling side because of retailers (supermarkets) power in deciding the final price paid by consumers. In that context, processors' idle capacity is engineering and not economic and is due to the fact that they sell products with added value to customers with relatively high purchasing power, which is a relatively small population. The fact that processors set prices can be taken as a case of barometric price leadership (they are the best informed buyers).

(d) Retailers were found to have some market power over processors and urban consumers. Based on information of processors price lists and retail audits to supermarkets, it was found that supermarkets set high marketing margins over pasteurised milk (in some cases more than twice the processors' recommended retail margin). This has effects on food security (affordability) because these are products purchased by relatively poor urban population. 

(e) The informal market can be thought as a contributor to food security (affordability) as it sells raw milk at a price much lower than that of pasteurised milk (about 1/3 of the price of pasteurised milk). In 2013 it was estimated that the informal market receives about 63% of the milk from the dairy herd (i.e., excluding milk from the native zebus).

Major findings as regards aim (2) are:

(a) Economic growth of the sector should differentiate the milk production and value added products. The growth of raw milk production (by 7% per year from 2004 to 2013) have been through the improvement of productivity and increase in the number of dairy cows (between 2004 and 2013 yields grew by 2.1% per year and the number of cows by 4.8% per year). This has been due to the work of donors, Government and producers associations. The formal sector has also grown by 12% per year during the same period (as measured by milk collection). Nevertheless, excluding milk from the zebu herd, processors collection represented only 36.4% of the milk produced.

(b) As regards the strategy to further develop the sector: (1) The processors/formal sector would benefit with investment to improve infrastructure (particularly roads and electricity power). (2) Micro processing is a strategy that seems not to have future due to: management issues, lack of purchasing power of the population, lack of scale economies in comparison with the large processors sector. However, it should be noted that the Government and some milk bulking groups are keen on this. (3) Given the size of the informal market, selling directly is already happening. This is in direct conflict with the reform of the Milk Act that aims at stopping the selling of raw milk in urban and rural areas. Instead the discussion should be on how to ensure that the raw milk is of good quality. 

As regards further questions:

The dairy sector in Malawi has the potential to contribute to economic growth, food security and to improve the livelihood of the poor. The limiting factor for economic growth seems to be the demand in both cases (raw and processed milk). Domestic demand is limited by the population's purchasing power. 

It is our view, given the facts, that the Government of Malawi, the donors and other stakeholders need to commit on a joint strategy for the dairy sector so the results are coherent. We feel that there needs to be stakeholder consensus as regards:

? whether the strategy should be guided by business development or poverty alleviation;
? whether the Government and donors should focus on consolidating in the Southern and Central regions instead of trying to develop the Northern region. Or just focus on the Southern region;
? What strategy Malawi should follow in terms of development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The outcomes of the project have been disseminated to a very large audience through presentations and research and policy briefings: within Malawi to a number of different stakeholders such as the Government, donors, NGOs, producers associations, processors, academia working on the sector; and also in conferences to international organisations (International Livestock Research Institute) and academics.

As regards how the outcomes of the project might be taken forward and by whom: (1) it is expected that the outcomes related to production efficiency (farmers), operation of the MBGs, retailers pricing will be taken forward by producers associations and processors mainly due to their competence. (2) as regards the outcomes regarding the structure of the dairy sectors (e.g., size of the informal market), it is expected that they will be taken forward by NGOs and producers associations aiming at the reform of the Malawi Milk Act. 

As regards academia, we envisage two groups that will be taking forward the outcomes from the project: (1) The Malawian academics, which were part of the team. As recognised by them, the work and all the data collected open opportunities for a number of PhD and Master students to do further work on the sector. (2) The SRUC team has produced several working papers during the lifetime of the project (several of which have been presented in international and UK conferences). It is expected that these papers will be submitted to journals in the next two years. They cover areas of production efficiency, milk bulking group efficiency, supply chain management, reform of the Malawian Milk Act, retailers' margins and consumers' preferences for milk. A paper on consumption of dairy products has already been published in the African Journal of Agricultural Economics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F52B86FD-F8B2-42EE-9F20-E8EF36A2250A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sruc.ac.uk/info/120037/land_economy_environment_and_society/802/assessing_contribution_of_dairy_sector_to_economic_growth_and_food_security_in_malawi</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is a dataset constructed from milk delivery to processors by milk bulking groups in Malawi.
