224,930 were children of school age. Although the cause of such disability can be events such as extreme prematurity or brain infections, genetic factors could account for 85%. Some genetic risk is inherited, but not all. Recent research has shown that, during the formation of the egg or sperm, minor chromosomal structural anomalies can occur. They are known as copy number variations (CNVs). The most serious CNVs are not present in either parent, but are 'newly occurring'. Fortunately, these are rare events, but if they occur in key regions of our genome they are strongly associated with ID. Nowadays, the cost of examining a patient's DNA for CNV is coming down dramatically. In the UK nearly all children with ID presenting to paediatric services have the test. The National Health Service (NHS) pays, and reports are stored in the UK Regional Genetics Centres (RGC).

In 10-15% the test reveals a CNV that is probably the cause of ID. Up to 45,000 people each year have these tests. Consequently, there is an enormous wealth of information about CNV held within UK RGC. 

Knowing that a particular CNV may cause ID is valuable, but ID is commonly associated with severe behavioural and emotional problems too. In adult life, many individuals with ID go on to have more serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia. We do not currently understand why these problems develop in some people with ID but not in others. When a clinically significant CNV is found in a child with ID, families deserve to be told what the future holds for that child, and how they should best manage behavioural and educational issues to avert poor mental health outcomes. Our unique and novel programme of research aims to rectify that deficiency. 

Our main objective is to create a novel and comprehensive genetic knowledge base, incorporating a wide range of rare CNV, linked to detailed information about the genetic anomaly's impact on adjustment in childhood and adulthood. We have spent the past year testing the feasibility of our MRC-funded research strategy, and have achieved all our objectives. We are now embarking on a further 3.5 year programme of research to build on the infrastructure we have created. Our IMAGINE legacy resource will be accessible to clinicians managing people with ID, not only in the UK but also around the world, and its establishment will benefit people with ID and their families throughout the lifespan. 

In one workstream, we are drawing on the opportunity offered by the NHS-based resource of CNV reports. We will focus on behavioural adjustment in childhood, and aim to recruit around 5,000 families nationally. We have shown that it is possible to obtain parent reports about behaviour and abilities of children online, or by telephone, using well-tested measures of behavioural adjustment, social circumstances and medical history. Families are enthusiastic to tell us about their children and they value the reports we send them, following completion of our online assessments. These provide a useful summary for schools and clinicians alike.

In the other workstream, the focus is on a few relatively common CNV that are associated with a particularly high risk of poor mental health in adulthood. We select children with the designated CNVs from the national study, study their abilities and their adjustment by home-based assessments,. We will assess the severity of emotional and behavioural problems, and the importance of environmental risks, such as parental mental health, ethnicity or poverty. We will also recruit adults with ID who possess the same relatively common CNVs, to study long-term outcomes. In this way we aim to discover, for the first time, how the risk attaching to these important CNV manifests in childhood and adulthood, and potentially identify points for intervention to ameliorate that risk.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our study aims to evaluate the impact of rare CNV on risk of mental health disorder in childhood and adulthood by utilizing data on individuals with ID tested by array CGH within NHS UK genetics services. From data mining and prospective recruitment, we will focus on clinically significant CNV (and - potentially - on SNV too). We will be conducting internet-based population phenotyping on up to 5000 children by June 2019. We take advantage of existing NHS resources and validated, inexpensive and appropriate methodologies for on-line phenotyping [84% of UK families have internet access at home]. The study offers remarkable value for money. It comprises two primary workstreams (WS1 &amp;amp; WS2), which are closely interconnected and complementary. 

First, a national 'extensive' survey of children with ID who possess CNV abnormalities reported as clinically significant from aCGH, based on data mining and prospective recruitment from UK Regional Genetics Centres (RGC). WS1 focuses on behavioural adjustment in children of school age. Nearly all assessments are on-line, or by telephone, using standardized measures of behavioural adjustment, social circumstances and medical history. Recruitment commenced in 2015. 

WS2 is conducting an 'intensive' phenotyping of individuals with CNV-associated ID, focusing on a small number of genetic anomalies previously reported to be associated with high risk of adverse mental health outcome and poor adaptive functioning [especially deletions at 1q21.1, 15q11.2, 15q13.3, 16p11.2]. Children with the selected CNVs are sourced from the national phenotypic study. Adults with ID carrying the same CNVs, also sourced from UK NHS RGC, will be recruited to study long-term outcomes. Dedicated research teams test participants in their homes.

Over the past year, we have completed a feasibility study that has achieved all our objectives. We have shown that online testing yields valid data on adjustment and that it is acceptable to families.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our study will impact short-term upon the domains of clinical practice and quality of life for affected families. Potential economic benefits include more efficient targeting of resources and reduced familial disruption. Longer-term, knowledge arising from genetic discoveries could support partnership with industry through targeted drug development. We are working closely with stakeholders throughout this programme, including the charity UNIQUE and other parent-support organizations. 
Clinicians in the NHS increasingly request specialist genetic investigations for children with ID. Usually, the results do not translate into specific recommendations for management or prognostic statements relating to behavioural adjustment, although families would welcome such knowledge. By linking, for the first time, genotypic data on specified CNV with standardized phenotypic data, our study will generate clinically valuable information. 
Unusual behaviour patterns or emotional disorders associated with ID are often ascribed to inappropriate parenting practices. Recognizing common disorder-specific patterns is the first step to reassuring parents, and educating clinicians/social support staff. Impact will reduce self-blaming and stress, with resultant improved quality of life for affected families. Impact timescale &amp;lt; 5years. 
Impact of child behaviour can be reliably and easily measured across time, and may independently predict future symptoms and psychiatric disorders, including the interactive process by which disturbed emotions and behaviour can undermine family/individual quality of life. New opportunities for intervention could ensue, thus enhancing parents' economic activity (e.g. by promoting their mental health, reducing school exclusions, limiting risk of parental separation). Impact timescale &amp;lt;5 years. 
Education and Care Professionals: Intellectual disability implies global impairments in cognitive skills. Yet some developmental trajectories may be preserved (exemplified by the relatively good language skills of children with Williams syndrome). Parsing the wide range of ID by CNV subtyping, may allow the identification of rare variant disorders in which islets of ability are common. Gaining such knowledge about specific CNV has implications for education planning, and fostering the maximization of individual potential. Such discoveries could inform policy on the management of children with CNV-related ID, including support required to mainstream, or provision of speech and language services. Information on environmental factors influencing emergence of challenging behaviour linked to genotypic risk could point to genotype-specific interventions, reducing risk of transfer to residential care and the associated costs. Impact timescale &amp;lt;5 years. 
Clinical Pharmacology Developmental pathways; in ID, such pathways overlap with autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. We lack a lifespan perspective on risk related to genotype. Our accelerated longitudinal cohort study, linking genotype to phenotype could facilitate pathway and network analysis of complex 'omics data in high-risk populations. There are potential synergies that could lead, in longer term, to academic-pharmaceutical industry partnerships leading to the discovery of causal mechanisms and potential novel drug targets for intervention. Impact timescale &amp;lt;10 years. 
Training of skilled researchers: Within the framework of the program we are fostering the academic skills of junior staff (NIHR-funded Academic Clinical Fellows) that are on a career track to become academic child psychiatrists. Impact timescale &amp;lt;5 years.
International collaborations: The IMAGINE team has already been invited to participate in an international discussion group in Washington, to discuss harmonization of phenotyping protocols. This comprehensive phenotyping network would serve as the framework for a multi-center clinical trials network as candidate drugs come available.
