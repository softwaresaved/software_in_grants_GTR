The aim was to explore the possibilities for management of these complex social-technical-ecological systems - whether integrated, adaptive or collaborative - and the continuing challenges thereof, from theoretical, multi-disciplinary and practical perspectives, and in relation to basins of varying scale from the more-or-less local to the trans-boundary. The workshop considered multiple perspectives on basin management - ecological, social, technical and economic - to address the inherent complexities, trade-offs and multiple disciplinary approaches involved in identifying effective solutions to the need to maintain healthy aquatic environments while delivering sustainable water services.
