The work will be carried out in tandem with a currently active project that is looking at the environmental barriers faced by many people in managing continence including access to public toilets. A steady decline in the availability of these facilities has resulted in current public provision being at an all time low. &lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />One of the key reasons for toilet closures is through vandalism and ?anti-social? behaviours. This has lead to a number of design initiatives and guides to tackle such issues through design. Current design guidance for publicly accessible toilets tends to offer a one-size-fits-all solution, which does not consider the wider community needs. This is problematic not only for access for the general population but also when considering how robust a facility needs to be to deter possible anti-social behaviour. &lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />This project examines existing provision to understand the varied challenges providers face in regards to non-toileting behaviour. In addition it will consult with communities and capture relevant examples of good or bad design that may be considered to ?put off? users opposed to creating toilet facilities that users feel safe and secure using. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12126</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal College of Art</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Incubation of GBPTM with Innovation RCA</gtr:description><gtr:id>753A6711-4DDD-43D4-8B3B-D5B24F041080</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration was finalised in the forst week of March 2017, but we are confident we will have released the smart phone application by the end of the year.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners Innovation RCA will hold 20% of our company Public Convenience in return they will provide access to social enterprise networks and possible investors.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A collaborative agreement has begun with Innovation RCA to incubate the Great British Public Toilet Map (also in partnership with long term collaborators Neon Tribe) to develop the key data held by the map into a smart phone application.

Already 16 datasets have been published with dozens more in the application process. Ordnance Survey have also just changed their policy and now allow councils to publish their toilet location data, removing a huge barrier in this field.

Its aim is to create a national open dataset. The concept and pilot site was developed as an output from the TACT3 research project to improve access to public toilets for people of all ages, in response to the complexity of both today's public toilet provision and individual needs. The lack of such a resource meant existing maps, websites and apps were inaccurate, out-of-date and incomplete. We successfully won further funding from Nominet Trust in 2013 to further develop the website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BB09D425-6159-4A21-A937-10EDCE0780E1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research team identified government open-data initiatives as an opportunity to transform public toilet information, through engaging with local councils. Although councils were encouraged to publish open data, they did not know what types of information were of use to the public. TGBPTM has frequently been recognised by open data initiatives as it presents a people-centred application for open data to address a genuine social need. We included toilet data from the OpenStreetMap project, collected data from council websites and through 296 Freedom of Information requests (covering 83% of 406 relevant councils), and developed a crowd-sourcing interface so that individuals could add and edit toilet information themselves. We've sustained engagement from 10% of councils including officers adding or editing data on TGBPTM. Several councils provide a link to TGBPTM on their own website. We submitted a case to data.gov.uk to publish public toilet open data and remove the Ordnance Survey licence restrictions on public toilet locations that impinged councils from publishing open data. Our request was pursued by the Open Data User Group (ODUG) and the Local Government Association (LGA), supported by individual councils, bringing about change to Ordnance Survey's national policy by making public toilet locations exempt from derived data licence restrictions in September 2014. The raised profiles of public toilets, through TGBPTM lead to provision becoming one of 3 themes for a Local Open Data Incentive Scheme. This resulted in the first national standard for open data on public toilets developed with our input and using key elements of the research. 89 councils to date have published open data to the standard, each receiving &amp;pound;1000. Overall the number of councils publishing public toilet open data has increased from 1 in 2010 to over 100 today either in response to our direct requests or indirectly through the incentive scheme. The website has recorded 117561 unique users since it launched on World Toilet Day 2014. There have been 2930 edits via the crowd-sourcing interface including nearly 1000 toilets added by the public. Our press release led to articles in The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Mirror, BT.com and local news sites. Support from Crohn's and Colitis UK has emphasised how many people rely on toilet access to leave home and the importance of resources like TGBPTM. The charity's website had thousands of page views on World Toilet Day and TGBPTM receives 13% of its referred traffic from Crohnsandcolitis.org.uk. We are developing this mutually beneficial relationship through a proposal for a multi-charity consortium to: develop the map, launch an app, improve the database and ensure the project's sustainability. Our social media accounts enable further media contact, including an interview on BBC Radio 2 in January 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The Great British Public Toilet map</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://greatbritishpublictoiletmap.rca.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The Great British Public Toilet map now holds the largest database (8000+) of Publicly Accessible Toilets available throughout the UK.
