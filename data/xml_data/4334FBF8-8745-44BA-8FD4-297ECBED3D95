a framework for developing a series of 2-3 other embedded projects - the primary aim of which is improving VHB provision and knowledge exchange across partners. In doing so we will share good practice and model novel forms of engagement across an industry in critical need of innovation.

The built environment is perhaps the most ubiquitous example of the creative economy in modern Britain, yet is generally overlooked and undervalued in this context. The UK construction industry contributes around 10% of UK GDP. The work of the professions that drive it is therefore of vital importance to our society. Their expertise is reflected in a strong global reputation but the market is shrinking (RIBA Building Futures Report, p.39). 

In 2007, the Labour government announced a target of building an extra three million homes in England by 2020 to help deal with the growing demand for houses. At the same time it set up the framework to be world class in the delivery of zero-carbon homes by 2016. According to the Calcutt Review of Housebuilding Delivery this would 'stretch' an industry (2007, p.7) not yet ready for these demands. The need for bulk delivery of sustainable housing remains the same, even after a change of government. Local authorities look to housing associations and private sector developers such as the VHBs to help them achieve these demands however the recent recession means that house builders are struggling more than ever to minimize their costs. This is likely to impact on design quality which, as CABE research has indicated was poor, even before the recession (CABE, Space in New Homes, What Residents Think, 2009 ). Our project focuses on improvements to the supply chain. The Calcutt Review has identified the need for VHBs to work with partners with the 'necessary expertise' to make this happen (2007, p.8). This is where architectural SME practice and academia come in.

There is a great deal of, largely unacknowledged, research potential in SMEs in the architectural creative industries, yet these practices are under threat - their traditional market is being taken over by large interdisciplinary conglomerates (RIBA, Building Futures Report, 2010, p.32).The project will provide the necessary support to allow these firms to deploy their creative energy in a wider industry context, to build on their research base and to develop new business models. 

Academia has an important role to play in giving SME practices access to cutting edge research. Through the embedded research projects our departments will become a shared resource of both equipment and knowledge where practitioners and academics can exchange knowledge, similar to the MIT's model of 'Fablabs', at the same time providing opportunities for academic researchers to test their ideas in a real world setting.

There are three elements to the project:

- Knowledge Exchange through the Ideas Lab and the 2-3 embedded research projects that emerge from them disseminated through partner networks.
- Innovation resulting from the 2-3 embedded research projects developed by architectural SME practice and academia in partnership with Taylor Wimpey.
- Development of practice based research through the above activities and through the Housing Practice Research Review to be undertaken, in partnership with the RIBA, through which we will be able to identify the current state of practice based housing research. The report from this review will act as a platform for research in this area and as a framework for a Research Practice Guide, the focus of a series of CPD events.

These are the ingredients of a strategy to expand the reach of project and to change the face of VHB housing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the long term (ten years) this pilot project, if developed into a larger centre, has the potential to bring about:

- Improvements to the quality of our built environment, bringing benefits to health, leisure and tourism and a reduction in crime.
- Improvement to the image of the housing industry in Britain, a recognition of its world leading capability in this area and its economic competitiveness at a global scale.
- Improvements to housing policy.
- Improvements in the effectiveness of engagement between VHBs and local authorities.
- New strategies to address education, skills shortages and employment within the housing industry.
- Inform good practice in the provision of new homes.


Much depends on the precise nature of the embedded projects, but our aim overall is to bring about the following benefits:

[1]Volume House Builders (VHBs)

- VHBs will be exposed to the low cost, low risk, potential of novel forms of engagement with architectural SMEs and academia
- The introduction of incremental innovations in VHB activity to refine the shared space of their developments, increase consumer choice and hence competitiveness. 
- The introduction of new business models, moving away from the house as consumer item and investment towards house as long term lifestyle choice within a resilient community.
- The project is likely to provide VHBs with additional tools for community engagement.

[2] Taylor Wimpey
- Currently it is difficult to differentiate between the products of the VHBs. It is hoped that this project will enable Taylor Wimpey to develop the distinctiveness of its work based on the research excellence achieved through this project.
- The project will help Taylor Wimpey to improve its current offer and competitiveness.

[4] Architectural SMEs
- Survey the extent and type of housing research currently taking place within architectural SMEs.
- Provide support in developing new funding streams for research.
- Provide sophisticated and specialized skills through CPD activity and academic Fablab facilities to allow SMEs to deliver to the global market place.
- Ally SMEs with larger industry providers, exchanging design and research knowledge for business acumen and modeling novel forms of collaboration.

[5] RIBA
- The project will promote the value of architectural input in new settings.
- It will endorse the RIBA as the leader in architectural research as well education.
- The HRPR will provide a platform of evidence to the RIBA's claims to being a global leader in the field.
- The project will give direction for future developments in architectural education.

[6] Design for Homes
- The project will promote the value of good home design.
- The embedded projects will explore particular areas of concern voiced by Design for Homes during the Ideas Lab process.

[7] Local Councils
- The project will encourage VHBs to give greater consideration of the way that their developments can add to existing communities.
- The embedded projects may address issues of procurement and shared ownership of benefit to local councils who are under pressure to create new homes.
- The project will bring about improvements to design quality and the built environment.

[8] Housing Associations and Charities 
- The good practice developed in the course of the project will be transferable to other housing providers.

[9] Home Owners and wider community
- Greater consumer choice achieved through incremental changes to VHB production.
- Improved use of community space within VHB developments is likely to be achieved through recommendations from embedded projects.
- Improved design quality achieved through embedded projects.
- More resilient VHB communities leading to stability in house prices.
- The embedded projects are likely to result in opportunities for greater community engagement and customisation of homes
- Greater cohesion between VHB developments and wider community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197026</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Design for Homes</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

The overall project was a report on the state of research in the profession. This impacted on research policy at the Royal Institute of British Architects contributing to a recent strategic motion to put research and innovation at the forefront of the institution.

The second part of the project was a call which resulted in three practitioner/academic collaborations. The call and the process had impact in driving research in practice up the agenda of SME practices.

The embedded projects themselves each had their own impact. Particularly successful were Parking Space and Motivating Collective Custom Build which had Parliamentary Launches attended by the Minister for Housing and the Secretary of State for Planning respectively. The Minister for housing gave his endorsement to Parking Space and, anecdotally, Collective Custom Build influenced ministerial thinking on the new development at Ebsfleet near London.

Ash Sakula who were a collaborating practice on Motivating Collective Custom Build were commissioned to design a custom build system by Igloo Carillion https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/carillion-igloo-unveils-designs-for-pioneering-custom-build-scheme/8673238.article

Sam Brown the Research Assistant for Motivating Collective Custom Build became a research at the National Custom and Self Build Association where he continues to use his expertise. http://www.nacsba.org.uk/news/author/sam-brown/</gtr:description><gtr:id>FC200F1E-5CD9-44EA-96D5-46279686AAB1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We described with evidence the very limited knowledge economy in architectural practice in the UK. This narrative was augmented with learning from a series of embedded projects which also delivered knowledge on improving parking in housing developments, custom build housing (this influenced current governmental debates in this area) and the use of public realm in Volume House Builder estates. 

We also developed a good system for supporting research in practice by utilising the skills of early career investigators.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project is being developed through my subsequent project and through the research activities of the project partners.
