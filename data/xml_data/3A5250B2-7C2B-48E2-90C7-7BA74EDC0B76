The answer depends not only on the equation in question but also the person asking. A physicist studying the equations of motion of comets might ask how many different kinds of path a comet can take through space (is the orbit periodic?). On the other hand, number theorists are interested in diophantine equations. These are equations in some number of variables and with integer (i.e. whole number) coefficients, studied with the understanding that one is interested only in solutions where the variables themselves take integer values. We will study the question: how many solutions does a diophantine equation have?

Solving diophantine equations is difficult, and it is often interesting to study families of equations and see what can be said about the large-scale behaviour of the family (is the number of solutions finite or infinite?). In the last 10 years Manjul Bhargava and his collaborators have taken this perspective and proved a number of groundbreaking results in number theory. They have focused in particular on families of diophantine equations arising from families of elliptic and hyperelliptic curves. They show that certain proxies for the set of solutions, called Selmer groups, can be related to such concrete and classical objects as binary quartic forms and pencils of quadrics in projective space. Among the many theorems they have proved this way, let us just mention the existence of a positive proportion of elliptic curves over the rationals with only finitely many (rational) solutions -- a striking qualitative result.

We will study the arithmetic of families of non-hyperelliptic curves. The families we are interested in come from deformation theory and algebraic geometry, being the versal deformations of exceptional curve singularities. Hyperelliptic curves are the simplest algebraic curves, being double covers of the projective line, and their geometry and arithmetic is relatively accessible. The arithmetic of our non-hyperelliptic families is much less explicit. We will exploit the hidden connections that our families have to deformation theory and representation theory to obtain results about Selmer groups as precise and complete as those of Bhargava and his collaborators in the hyperelliptic case.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will have a significant academic impact on the areas of diophantine geometry, analytic number theory, and arithmetic algebraic geometry. The success of this proposal will constitute a significant advance in the new field of `arithmetic invariant theory', which is closely connected to each of these areas. It will also prove the validity of new organizational principles which will help other researchers both in understanding the structure of the subject and in formulating new research directions. Our intended approach will result in advances in geometric representation theory and algebraic geometry and will create new ties between number theory and these research areas. 

The research will also have impact outside of a strictly academic environment. It seems likely that it will be possible to develop the abstract techniques proposed here into a concrete algorithm to calculate the 2-Selmer groups of Jacobians of certain non-hyperelliptic curves over the field of rational numbers. This would be an exciting new advance over existing algorithms for studying the arithmetic of hyperelliptic curves over the rationals, and it would be very desirable to implement such an algorithm in existing commercial-level computing software such as Sage and Magma. Related algorithms for elliptic curves already play an essential role in commercial-grade cryptography standards, and have an obvious importance in the contexts of the economy and national security.

The proposed research will raise the international research profile of the UK. In order for the UK to maintain its world-leading status as a centre for research in number theory, investment in basic research and in new research directions is essential. The projects outlined here represent an excellent opportunity for the UK to establish expertise in a new and exciting area of number theory. The success of this project would establish the UK as the first research centre in this area outside of the USA. In addition, the PI will train an RA who will then be well-equipped to continue with their own research in the field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98253</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N007204/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
