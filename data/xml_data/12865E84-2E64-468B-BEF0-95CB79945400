Who performs Shakespeare, when and how, helps define who we are as a community and how, collectively, we see ourselves changing. The playing of Shakespeare by performers of African and Asian descent offers insights into the evolution of British society since World War II. Yet this remarkable narrative has scarcely been sketched. This project will deliver a critical history of multicultural Shakespearean performance in 20th-century Britain, documenting and surveying the work and opinions of artists from diverse ethnic backgrounds exploring Shakespeare today. It will reclaim the history of multi-ethnic Shakespeare in the UK, for the widest public, and map possibilities for broadening cultural access in the 21st century. The historical outline is clear. First, very infrequently, remarkable Black performers - Americans or West Indians visiting Britain, already successful in other areas of the arts - were invited to play Shakespeare's African characters. In 1930 Paul Robeson played Othello in London; in 1955 his fellow American Gordon Heath was the first Black Othello on television. The Trinidadian Edric Connor was the first Black actor at Stratford's Memorial Theatre, playing Gower in Pericles in 1957. These events were interconnected: Tony Richardson directed both the BBC Othello and Pericles, and he reconceived Gower as a singing role for Paul Robeson; unable to appear for political reasons, Robeson suggested Connor as his replacement. As immigration increased and the global anti-colonial movements spread, these appearances in Shakespeare became iconic. Robeson finally played Othello at Stratford (1959) in the wake of the Notting Hill riots; during the run he sponsored the first Notting Hill Carnival and the first Black British newspaper. In the 1960s multi-talented artists like Cy Grant, Cleo Laine and Errol John played Shakespeare, yet integrated opportunities were still slow to develop. Only in the 1980s, at a time of marked racial tension and urban unrest, did UK classical theatres develop inclusive casting policies.
The project aims to map this marginalised history and to put on record, through a series of interviews, the experiences and practical insights of Robeson's successors. From the mid-1980s Shakespeare had a key role in the work of Talawa Theatre, Temba and, within the British Asian community, Tara Arts, addressing questions of postcolonialism, social integration, and more recently fundamentalism. This study will analyse the results and consider the roles of key theatres. New demographics inspired innovative reassessments of Shakespeare in the regions. In London, Stratford East updated Lear as King of England (1988) and Comedy of Errors as a hip-hop musical (2003). The Young Vic pioneered non-traditional casting after a multi-racial Romeo and Juliet (1982) and hosted Peter Brook's Hamlet with Adrian Lester in 2001. The significance of the National Theatre's casting policies will be examined, from Olivier's 1964 Othello to Lester's 2003 Henry V. Attention will be given to Tim Supple's TV and stage productions (Twelfth Night, Channel 4, 2003; As You Like It, Leicester 2006) proposing a multiethnic, multilingual Shakespeare.
Some productions were accused of exoticism and sensationalism, e.g. the 1971 Black Macbeth). Hugh Quarshie argued that 'If a Black actor plays Othello does he not risk making stereotypes seem legitimate and true? Of all the parts in the canon perhaps Othello is the one which should most definitely not be played by a by a Black actor.' But for David Harewood, playing Othello was 'a grounding in black consciousness'. Engaging with these debates, we invite actors to reflect on their experiences. From Robeson's Othello to the RSC's 2010 Hamlet with Dharmesh Patel, directed by Tarell Alvin McCraney and beyond, Multicultural Shakespeare will evaluate the past and outline future possibilities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the nature of its subject, the dissemination of this research beyond conventional academic circles is fundamental. The disturbances of Summer 2011 have drawn attention to the importance of establishing a sense of cultural identity within urban communities, and of ensuring that the continuing history of New British contributions to mainstream culture is not marginalized. 
By providing study materials for use in workshops and projects, Multicultural Shakespeare will complement and support the work of theatres' education departments such as the RSC's and other theatre companies including Globe Education (with whom Howard has close links), helping young people across all communities to use the plays to make discoveries about themselves and the world they live in, improve their self confidence and attain more. By telling the stories of the theatrical pioneers and their contribution to this change, the project will draw public attention to the need for casting policies which create theatre ensembles representing the UK's racial diversity and will contribute to the ongoing national debate about diversity in the arts begun by Naseem Khan's seminal report for the Arts Council in 1976, 'The Arts Britain Ignores', and continued in Baroness Young's 'Whose Theatre?' (Arts Council 2006).
The involvement of a range of consultants from the BME community - especially in London and the Midlands - with direct and personal expertise in UK Caribbean history, and with experience of non-traditional casting and inclusion policies in theatre and broadcasting, will both privilege the experience of the communities they represent and ensure that the project's impact is appropriately targeted for maximum impact. They will serve as ambassadors within multi-cultural communities to foster collaborations, assisting in the gathering of primary research material and dissemination of outputs.
A key product of Multicultural Shakespeare will be a public programme of events reaching minority communities in a number of urban centres, focusing on Coventry, Birmingham and London. Building on the CAPITAL Centre's acknowledged expertise in performative teaching and learning, the Multicultural Shakespeare project has the potential for long-term societal impact through the reclamation of lost histories and by providing aspirational models for young people, both directly on those who attend the exhibitions or associated events but also indirectly via the printed and electronic resources which will be its long-term legacy. Multicultural Shakespeare directly extends Howard's experience on the Robeson Project, working with local organisations (n.b. the Bernie Grant Centre, Tottenham; Camden Black History Month) and with eminent members of Black communities both nationally (e.g. Baroness Lola Young) and internationally (e.g. Paul Robeson Jr; Alphonse Keasley of STAA). Collaborators and associates on the Robeson exhibition and the linked talks and performances have included the Royal Shakespeare Company, Bristol Old Vic, Liverpool Playhouse and Northern Stage - as well as Shakespeare's Globe, the Victoria and Albert Museum's Theatre Dept. and Black Heritage Programme, Harvest Heritage Arts and Media, Bristol, Warwick Arts Centre and BBC Radio (a 2011 documentary based on Howard's research reached over 350,000 listeners), all of whom have expressed support for Multicultural Shakespeare. These contacts will be built on and expanded to maximise the quality and impact of this larger programme of investigation and dissemination.
Multicultural Shakespeare will build on the Robeson Project's experience of creating digital materials --talks and debates and unique archive materials on Shakespeare, race and performance -- and making them freely available online (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/capital/teaching_and_learning/projects/robeson/). The interviews, forming a major part of the research process, will be accessible free of charge on the University's webs</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>498575</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A dramatized documentary written by PI Tony Howard, based on research and original interviews.

This performance piece is a sequel to and continuation of 'I Have Done the State Some Service: Robeson, Othello and the FBI' (2010-13), a verbatim theatre piece by Tony Howard. The enthusiastic response led to Howard advising and appearing in two BBC radio documentaries on Robeson, and to the concept of the Multicultural Shakespeare project. It established a working relationship with Warwick Arts Centre and was performed there as the opening event of the project's public outreach programme.

In Robeson's Footsteps is an evolving piece, for example emphasising the artistic and political work of performers brought up in the Midlands (The Drum, Birmingham, 2015) and London (Tricycle Theatre, Kilburn, 2016).

'Multicultural Shakespeare: A Day of Debates'. Organised by Tony Howard and Honorary Fellow Suman Bhuchar in collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum. See:
http://www.vam.ac.uk/whatson/event/3326/multicultural-shakespeare-debate-1-4755/. 

This event brought together leading actors and directors to share their experiences and insights into the role of black and Asian practitioners in shaping contemporary understanding of Shakespeare and the plays' potential role in multicultural Britain. include: Rakie Ayola, Bill Alexander, Iqbal Khan, Danny Sapani and Hugh Quarshie (morning) and Tim Supple, Jonathan Mann and David Tse Ka-Shing (afternoon). 
Thanks to excellent publicity by the V&amp;amp;A, and growing awareness of the Multicultural Shakespeare project, this event attracted an audience that included a remarkable number of key figures in the performing arts - and especially the development of BAME Shakespeare - including past and present directors of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, Temba Theatre, Leicester Curve and Tamasha Theatre.

The event included the exhibition 'To Tell My Story' and the multimedia screening of images of black and Asian Shakespeare from the V&amp;amp;A collection, selected by Tony Howard.

Output: video recordings to be made available in 2016 through the Multicultural Shakespeare website.

Outcomes: As a direct result of the event, several participants expressed their wish to contribute to the Multicultural Shakespeare oral history archive.

Tony Howard was interviewed and spoke on several BBC local radio stations to discuss the project's progress, research, and relevance to BAME communities..

These debates triggered intense discussions which exposed a strong sense of frustration within the theatrical profession - a widespread conviction that openings for BAME creative artists were improperly limited, and that the lack of cultural diversity in the representation of Shakespeare was symptomatic of a cultural crisis. The event contributed to the climate of opinion which led to the foundation of the movement (and now charity) Act for Change (launched June 2014), to representations to the Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, and to a number of individual interventions increasing diversity in Shakespeare (for instance involving Hugh Quarshie and Iqbal Khan (RSC 2015).

An exhibition outlining the history of black and Asian UK performances of Shakespeare up to 2012 was launched at Warwick Arts Centre in December of that year. The exhibition panels placed BAME theatre in its changing social contexts and used images and quotations to transmit information accessibly to passers-by in the Arts Centre's busy public spaces. The strategy was to share information as widely as possible (this was the children's Christmas Show season). The exhibition 'To Tell My Story' closed with a panel 'Tell us YOUR Story' inviting the public - and practitioners - to contribute information and memories via the project website.
The exhibition was taken by invitation to Shakespeare's Globe in 2013 where it was initially seen by 78,876 visitors. It returned for a second season and accompanied the Globe production of King Lear (starring the St. Lucian actor Joseph Marcell) to the West Indies. The exhibition was displayed by libraries in Bristol and London and was installed for two months (May-June 2014) in the Langley Academy, Slough, as a result of a school visit to the Globe. It was displayed by theatres across the country as part of the companies' educational and outreach agendas, and in 2015 it toured extensively accompanying Tara Arts' multicultural version of Macbeth. During this period the exhibition content evolved to reflect the project's developing research - new panels were created for Macbeth in collaboration with Tara Arts - and this process culminated in January 2016 at the Tricycle Theatre.
In response to the 20012 launch, the project PI Tony Howard was interviewed for the leading audio archive TheatreVOICE (later followed by two more recordings tied to the project). An accompanying film was made by the AHRC and embedded in the project website (over 2,000 hits) and BBC and independent radio producers visited the exhibition before their broadcasts on black theatre history (Looking for the Moor, Radio 3, 2015 [Howard was a pre-production advisor]; Raising the Bar: [series] Radio 4, 2015). Howard appeared in a Radio 4 documentary on Paul Robeson (2015, repeated 2016). He was invited to join the academic advisory group for the British Library Shakespeare anniversary Exhibition 'Shakespeare in Ten Acts' (2016) and co-curated the section on black performers of Shakespeare. 
In order to increase the visibility of the research, Howard adapted archive and original interview material into a drama documentary, 'In Robeson's Footsteps' performed at the Drum (Birmingham 2015) and the Tricycle (London 2016). As with several project events, proceedings were recorded and put online. Here the intention was also to increase involvement in the research by BAME performers, many of whom became its active ambassadors. The Drum event led to an emerging working relationship with the Drum and the charity Generating Genius.
During the award period several events brought together academics, theatre practitioners and the general public. This was both a research method (the seminar 'Mapping Multicultural Shakespeare' [2013] organised by Postdoctoral Research Fellow Dr. Delia Jarrett-Macauley, forms the basis of her edited volume on The Diverse Bard) and a way of generating impact within the industry. Leading figures in British theatre attended as speakers or audience members and participated in vivid discussions of the position of BAME performers in British Shakespearean theatre today. This continued with 'Multicultural Shakespeare: A Day of Debates' (organised in collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum Theatre Department) which Howard discussed in a series of interviews for BBC local radio stations (BAME programmes, 24.4.2014). At these events - as in many oral archive interviews - specific criticisms were made of casting policies within arts institutions, to which several responded. See Othello (RSC, 2015, and King Lear (Manchester Exchange), Hamlet (RSC) and Macbeth (Shakespeare's Globe) - all 2016.
The multicultural outreach work continued through the grant award period via workshops with young people led by Sita Thomas and Nicholas Bailey (actor, leadership counsellor, Warwick Honorary Fellow); a national young peoples' creative writing competition (led by Delia Jarrett-Macauley); and sustained work (2014) with Bath Ethnic Minority Senior Citizens Association (Dr. Jarrett-Macauley). Sita Thomas produced and directed short Shakespeare films linked to this project for the National Theatre Education Department.
The impact of the Multicultural Shakespeare project became more visible with the public launch of the British Black and Asian Shakespeare Performance Database in January 2016. Its data was immediately publicised by the entertainment industry union EQUITY, by the pro-diversity movement (and now registered charity) Act for Change, by leading figures in the acting profession (many of whom have supported the project actively), by the trade press, and the by mass media (from The Stage and The Independent to Broadway World). Dr. Rogers has been invited to join professional committees, to speak at the National Theatre, and to attend a parliamentary meeting. The findings have become a significant part of the wider movement for greater diversity in the arts.
Tony Howard and Sita Thomas attended a symposium at UC Davis in California (September 2015) to explore ways of applying the Multicultural Shakespeare project's methods to the American situation. In 2016 US researchers approached the project to discuss the creation of a parallel database.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7C2368C1-7822-4D50-8152-B8827843669E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Recent research has begun to explore several aspects of the history, and current situation, of members of BAME communities working in the UK creative industries. For this study, the chosen focus was the production and performance of Shakespeare's plays, given their central role in the arts and education, and their iconic cultural significance. This is a strikingly underexplored field. 

The aim of the Multicultural Shakespeare project was (1) to create a database of Shakespearean performances in the UK by black and Asian performers, beginning with Paul Robeson's Othello (London 1930); (2) to compile an oral history through audio interviews with practitioners; (3) to involve industry practitioners actively in the research; (4) to build public awareness of the findings of and the underlying cultural issues - nationally and in specific BAME communities - from an early stage in the work.

THE DATABASE has for the first time established the statistical significance of BAME artists' historic role in defining contemporary understanding of Shakespeare. 1,210 Shakespearean performances since 1930 have employed BAME practitioners, in some 4,000 roles (current research figures). This has been a major and deepening contribution to British cultural life, and to chart it the database has extended its remit to cover work beyond the originally-proposed 2010 termination point.

Additionally, individual entries on artists and productions provide more detailed information - including examples of press reception - and links to other sources. This work - led and largely contributed by Dr. Jami Rogers - has been based on archive documentation held across the UK in public and personal collections, and it will we hope continue, given future funding.

At the same time as the database research has verified the scale and significance of BAME artists' contribution, it also allows for the statistical analysis of this information.

 For example the database graphs black British theatre artists' efforts in 1972-3 to use Shakespeare to respond to political events in the USA and postcolonial Africa. Later, on the other hand, the statistics point to the inadequacy of British theatre (and television)'s failure to cater for a new generation of BAME creative talent. Crucially, employment possibilities within classical theatre did not significantly improve until 1981/2, in the aftermath of the riots in Bristol, Birmingham and Liverpool. The database shows how Shakespearean drama then became an active signifier of BAME cultural advancement, both nationally and in regional theatres (from 1982 onwards) and in the work of new black and Asian companies such as Temba, Talawa and Tara Arts (late 1980s-90s). 

Supported by other documentation (including the interviews archive), the statistics reveal the social significance of multicultural Shakespearean experiments in Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester at this time, and map their national influence via individual careers and new casting policies. Ever since Paul Robeson returned to the role of Othello in 1959 (Stratford-upon-Avon), British black and Asian performers in Britain have followed his example by using Shakespeare to comment directly on current social and political issues. Since the 1990s, the numbers of young BAME performers in Shakespeare - and very recently the number of BAME directors - have increased significantly.

At the same time, however, analysis of the data reveals a continuing and significant problem - the fact that though more artists have recently been given work by subsidised classical theatres, the significance and status of the roles they play has been, and remain, very limited. To quote Dr. Rogers, there is in effect a 'glass ceiling' and 'a failure of imagination'.

ORAL ARCHIVE. Interviews with some fifty practitioners have been recorded, transcribed and archived. They include directors and actors from several generations and from diverse backgrounds. They provide unique biographical accounts of the processes whereby (a) members of BAME communities across the UK have come into contact with Shakespeare - how, at what age, through whose intervention - (b) its effect on their skills, their language, their self-awareness and sense of their relationship with established 'British' culture. (c) The interviews give details of the place of Shakespeare in their careers - older actors provided details of institutional racism which they encountered, gradually giving way to a more supportive climate and to greater artistic opportunities. (d) Actors also recorded their practical and interpretive insights into specific plays and roles, which they wished to share with young people using the project website. Finally (4) most of those interviewed wished to comment on the current situation of BAME performers in the UK. 

It soon became clear (early 2013) that there was widespread professional frustration in the BAME artistic community. Many of those interviewed for this project volunteered to disseminate its work and findings. A common question to the research team was: 'Why has no-one asked this before?' 

The oral archive's findings require much more analysis and wider publication, but overall these accounts of personal experiences testify to the importance of: 
Committed and well-funded teaching which encourages children to meet Shakespeare experientially through active learning; 
Access to professional performances locally at an early age;
The positive effect of role models and recognition - seeing 'people who look like me' [interviewee Rakie Ayola and others] onstage in Shakespeare; 
The empowering and transformational role of properly-funded youth activity work (for example Birmingham Youth Theatre in the 1980s and more recently the Hackney-Harlem Shakespeare Project); 
Greater diversity in drama school entry and training practices; 
The immediate need for greater diversity at managerial levels in the entertainment industry.
The immediate need for interventions to change attitudes to diversity within management.

ADDITIONALLY, both statistically and through personal testimony the research establishes (a) the growing significance of Shakespeare in British Asian performance culture - a 'third space' merging of classical and popular, Bollywood and Shakespearean, traditions. Sita Thomas has made a significant contribution to academic awareness and promotion of this, both in the UK and internationally. Here PhD thesis will be submitted in 2017. (b) For decades, networks of black and Asian performers have supported and encouraged one another within an industry dominated by 'gatekeepers' (from casting departments to Artistic Directors) from a different background. This has been a source both of strength (pioneering directors at Theatre Royal Stratford East and Birmingham Rep were often mentioned warmly) and of recurring problems: many performers denounced a culture of 'short memories and box-ticking'.

c) During the research it became especially clear that British East Asian artists have experienced a sense of exclusion from many of these practices and even from the discussions. This is an area of intense commitment and growing achievement, to be studied further and encouraged within the profession: the interviews opened up unforeseen avenues for our research, reflected in the final form of the exhibition 'To Tell My Story'.

In sum, the research establishes that many theatre workers in the BAME communities have a very complex relationship with 'Shakespeare'. 'Shakespeare' is seen as a medium for real personal empowerment - through language and imagination - for young people and theatre professionals alike. 'Shakespeare' has been inseparable from the careers of a wealth of now-iconic BAME artists whose greatest performances (and whose careers) remain inspirational. And yet 'Shakespeare' can still also signify a cultural system that encourages aspiration, only to exclude. The possibilities are immense and the past history of Shakespeare and ethnicity in the UK has much to reveal. For example the African American actor Ira Aldridge was invited to manage the Coventry Theatre as a response to the unexpected brilliance of his acting and the inadequacy of the previous management. Aldridge was asked to improve its professional standards of casting, rehearsal and production, and he succeeded. This was in 1828, when slavery in the Empire had still to be abolished. The past and the present are inextricably linked in the theatre, like 'Shakespeare' and the shifting attitudes of the community.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The database launched publicly in January 2016 and provides raw material for fellow researchers to explore from new directions. 

The data is being used by industry activists and opinion formers.

Theatre practitioners have been invited to contribute more materials, filling gaps and updating the records.

As of March 2016 there have been approaches from broadcasters, from researchers in the USA (considering developing a parallel database), and from the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union History Project (major interview archive founded by the BFI and BECTU).

Local theatres (Bradford) and cultural groups (Coventry) have emquired about collaborative possibilities, potentially using Multicultural Shakespeare research findings in artistic contexts.
The project PI Tony Howard has provided a potential model for such activities with the documentary drama, 'In Robeson's Footsteps' (Birmingham 2015, London 2016), based on and popularising the project's research.

In September 2015 informal discussions began in UC Davis (University of California: Education and English departments) to consider moves towards developing a Centre for Shakespeare and Ethnicity, working on interdisciplinary lines explored by the Multicultural Shakespeare project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2BA1D7D8-0494-4366-9718-C6ED7037464E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Diversity in the performing arts and media</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B566FA48-C7F2-4160-802B-33E4A69A9337</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since its public launch in 2013, the work of the project has been observed and supported by national organisations as well as individuals. Public events have been observed by directors and administrators of leading national and regional theatres (Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Shakespeare's Globe, Leicester Curve) as well as smaller theatre companies and broadcasters. This, like the oral archive programme, has established strong links with the acting profession (especially BAME artists) and, following the launch of the database, with unions, pressure groups and charities.

The main effects have been twofold: (1) increased awareness of the BAME presence in English cultural history has led to requests from theatres (both BAME-led and 'mainstream') to contextualise their work and add to their educational impact and social reach via the Multicultural Shakespeare exhibition and through other project events. Particular interest in the early history (Paul Robeson and his championing of the memory of Ira Aldridge) has led to participation in the British Library's 400th Anniversary Shakespeare Exhibition (2016), again stressing the role of black performers in British cultural history. Tony Howard was also asked to advise on the documentary 'Looking for the Moor' (Radio 3 2015). 

(2) The project has identified current problems of inclusion in the performance industry. Since late 2015 its findings have been used by individuals, unions (eg EQUITY) and diversity campaigns (eg Act for Change). The determination to make theatre more representative of the realities of multicultural Britain have become a major public concern for Arts Council England and the Government: see 'Equality, Diversity and the Creative Case - A data report 2012-2015'). Sir Peter Bazalgette confirmed in December 2015 that 'while some progress has been made in embedding diversity across the arts and culture sector, there is more to do.' [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/diversity-arts-and-culture-report-published-new-in/#sthash.u2HzwQue.dpuf]. In this climate the database findings were taken up by the british press and in the USA.

To bring these factors together: responding to specific inequities identified in the Project's public debates and by the database, in 2016 three major theatre companies (Manchester Exchange, RSC, Shakespeare's Globe) will for the first time present Shakespeare's greatest tragedies (King Lear, Hamlet, Macbeth) with BAME performers in the leading roles. PI Tony Howard was invited to contribute a programme essay outlining the work of the Project.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/shakespearean-black-and-ethnic-minority-actors-still-only-getting-minor-roles-a6816941.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The database, edited and principally compiled by Dr. Jami Rogers, contains the records of over 1100 productions of Shakespeare to which British black or Asian actors, directors and other production personnel have contributed.

It contains information about the production, the media reaction to the BAME personnel's work within these productions, and lists the roles actors have played in the plays recorded. It provides a record of achievements and a statistical framework for analysing shifting professional opportunities over 85 years.

The database is a major theatre history tool as well as having the ability to track casting policies from 1930 - 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B59DA42-D0B6-4D88-A2B6-DFAE252D4B3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The preliminary findings of the work were distributed to interested industry organisations, including the entertainment industry union, Equity, and the lobbying group Act for Change. Dr Jami Rogers was invited by Equity to attend a meeting at the House of Commons. 

The database was also the subject of a meeting with American scholars, and theatre/film practitioners held in California in September 2015, which was attended by Professor Tony Howard and Sita Thomas. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss ways in which the model for this database could be adapted for the American market. In January 2016 the project was approached by American researchers in the field with a view to establishing a database on parallel lines for the USA. Discussions regarding possible collaborations are developing.

The work is a growing contribution to casting policy in the UK entertainment industry, with an immediate impact. 
The public launch of the database in January 2016 attracted national and international press interest and continues to be cited by the trade press as a factor establishing problems of diversity in the performing arts; this is a major issue for cultural organisations and for Arts Council England.
