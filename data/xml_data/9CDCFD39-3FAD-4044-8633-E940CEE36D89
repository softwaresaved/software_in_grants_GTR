The goal of this project is to write up and submit four papers to top academic journals which criticize a common approach to this problem.\n\nTo begin, there are many views about which things are good and bad for people. For example, some of the popular accounts of things that are good for people include some or all of: happiness, pleasure, achievement, knowledge, freedom, autonomy, and so on. \n\nA common assumption in moral philosophy is that no matter which of these views is correct, we can somehow numerically measure the extent to which someone's life is going well or badly, much in the way that we can measure temperature or weight. In other words, moral philosophers have assumed that although there may be some arbitrariness in how we do this, this arbitrariness is similar to the arbitrariness in the choice between measuring temperature in centigrade and measuring it in Farenheight: it doesn't much matter which choice we make.\n\nThe approach to be criticized simply takes it for granted that we can make these kinds of measurements, and gives such measurements a central role in theorizing about how things that are good and bad for people ought to be distributed. For example, if you can numerically measure how well off each person is, you can meaningfully add all these numbers together to form a sum, and one famous view known as utilitarianism says that one situation is better than another just in case that sum is greater in the first situation than in the second.\n\nThe aim of this project is to critically examine this way of theorizing. To begin, it is far from obvious that we can measure how well off someone is in anything like the way we can measure temperature. Well-being seems more like hardness: while we can often say that one thing is harder than another, saying, for example, that it is twice as hard seems meaningless. And even if we can measure how well off someone is in numerical terms, it is far from obvious that this helps us to theorize. For example why should it matter to maximize the sum of people's well-being, numerically measured, rather than the product?\n\nThe goal of this project is to write and submit four papers on these kinds of issues. The first paper argues that, despite skepticism among welfare economists, we do have numerical measures of how well off people are which are well enough defined for the uses to which moral philosophers put them to be well defined.\n\nThe second paper argues that although we do have numerical measures of how well off people are, they play no important role in the defense or justification of various views about the distribution of things that are good and bad for people. Thus this paper claims that a whole way of doing moral philosophy is mistaken.\n\nThe third paper argues that this conclusion is not as destructive as it seems. It is often possible to provide defenses of views about distribution which do not appeal to numerical measures of how well off people are. In particular, this paper shows how to defend views about fairness without appealing to such measures.\n\nThe fourth paper does the same for equality. It argues that the best known views about the importance of equality can be defended without using numerical measures of how well off people are. This novel defense leads to a new understanding of egalitarianism and where it differs from other views about distribution.\n\nTogether with three earlier articles by the author, these four papers form a complete view about numerical measures of how well off people are and their legitimate use in theorizing about the ethics of distribution. This project also emphasizes the intimate connection between claims about risk and claims about distribution, and the importance of mathematical methods for understanding this connection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27908</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9E189655-247E-4830-B1FC-23C0B2D8CA67"><gtr:id>9E189655-247E-4830-B1FC-23C0B2D8CA67</gtr:id><gtr:title>Risk-Free Approaches to the Priority View</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Erkenntnis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/567b6a4df0dd50046b3ecfc1c7fef57c"><gtr:id>567b6a4df0dd50046b3ecfc1c7fef57c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McCarthy D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F013671/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
