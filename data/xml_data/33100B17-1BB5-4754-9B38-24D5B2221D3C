Despite its potential riches as a means to challenge stereotypes and add cultural value, it is sometimes viewed as a societal problem, associated with tensions, segregation and a clashing of cultures. By focusing on diversity as a problem, however, we have neglected to fully understand how and when diversity is associated with positive outcomes or how these can be embraced. The proposed project aims to address this gap in the literature by addressing under what conditions diversity is associated with social cohesion and educational achievement through the lens of intergroup contact theory. It will examine the extent of ethnic segregation in formal (classroom) and informal (cafeteria) spaces in secondary schools in Bristol, a diverse city in the United Kingdom, to enable an understanding of the relationship between observed behaviours, attitudes and achievement and to establish what can be done to intervene and promote more positive outcomes for all learners. The project will provide both theoretical and methodological contributions. 

Theoretically, the research will shed light on the compatibility of diversity, education and social attitudes addressing the ESRC strategic priority to promote a Vibrant and Fair Society. Whilst there has been much research which has examined the effects of diversity on wider society and educational outcomes (often in the U.S.), to date these effects have not been evaluated through the lens of intergroup contact theory taking into consider the nature and quality of the interactions occurring within and outside the classroom. As such, the project will develop a new theoretical approach which brings together perspectives from multiple disciplines to gain a holistic understanding of the diversity effect. 

Methodologically, the project will provide two main innovations. First, it will integrate multiple quantitative and qualitative methods and techniques longitudinally, moving beyond mere self-report of attitudes which is currently a focus in UK social science research on diversity, and in doing so provide a new, multilevel dataset for further research. This will include observations of seating behaviour in different spaces within the target schools, social network analysis and advanced statistical analysis of longitudinal questionnaire responses. Second, it will move beyond observations of the effects and develop a short and easy to implement intervention which will have potential to be scaled up and used across the UK and beyond. To achieve this, the project will work with teachers and other stakeholders in the design, execution, and dissemination of the research at different stages throughout and after the project. 

The project has potential for wide impact. The findings will inform understandings of diversity and how to best promote intergroup relations and academics for all learners beyond the social psychology and education audiences. This will deepen the evidence base that can inform policy and practice in the UK and internationally. Both local actors as well as international organisations have become increasingly interested in the effects of diversity on society. Examining the value of ethnic diversity will provide valuable lessons for schools and wider society informing strategies to reduce the likelihood of ethnic tensions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1.Who will benefit from the research?

Group 1: Practitioners: The project will help to uncover and promote best practice for teachers who are facing increasingly diverse classrooms and those who are striving to promote cohesion in their schools. This will include teachers within Bristol in addition to teachers nationally and internationally (see Pathways to Impact). Beyond secondary teachers, it will also be of interest to primary teachers and University lecturers who teach on PGCE and teacher training programmes. 

Group 2: School children: As the project aims to examine and promote pupil outcomes, participants who are directly involved in the project will benefit through both participation in the research and the findings. It is expected that the research will improve the immediate study environment for participants. It will also impact those not directly involved in the research both nationally and internationally through raising awareness of diversity and how to promote better learning and social outcomes for all learners in the classroom. 

Group 3: Government and policy makers at local, regional and central governmental levels (e.g. Equality and Diversity Council, the Equality and Human Rights Commission) in the four UK countries and internationally will also benefit from this research. Specifically, they will be made aware of the nature and extent of interaction in schools, how this impacts learning and social cohesion and how they could intervene in these processes through interventions and training for teachers. 

Group 4: The third sector: The research will also be of interest to stakeholders such as third sector organisations (e.g. Oxfam Education, Think Global) and those campaigning locally for the rights of minority students (e.g Bristol Race Equality steering group, Somali Educational Development Society of Bristol) and educational success for all learners (e.g. UNESCO promoting education for all). 

2. How will they benefit from the research? 

There are 4 key ways in which impact will be achieved (see Pathways to Impact) which are summarised below. 

(1) Stakeholder advisory group: the project will have a stakeholder advisory group which will include academics and non-academics who will meet twice a year to discuss the project. By engaging with the stakeholders from the outset of the project it will be possible to facilitate a wider dialogue to impact practitioners, government and policy makers and third sector organisations beyond the local authority (all of whom will be represented in the group). 

(2) Dissemination of findings: the PI will disseminate findings to user groups. This will include publishing research findings in an open access journal (e.g. Frontiers in Psychology) attending and presenting at user conferences, writing policy and research briefings, submitting press releases, establishing government links (by signing up to mailing lists) and through reporting findings on social media and in blogs and magazines. In addition to presenting materials on the University website, a project specific website will be created, this will raise awareness of the research to user groups beyond the local authority. 

(3) Workshops and Training materials: to gain practitioner impact, the training materials developed as a result of the project will be put up on the project website and advertised widely. Teachers from across the UK will also be invited to attend a training workshop at the end of the project. A policy workshop will be used to inform the government and local authorities of the project and its outcomes.

(4) Knowledge exchange placements: two planned knowledge exchange visits will ensure international coverage and impact of the research. The PI will engage with academics and non-academic beneficiaries to widen networks and promote impact in other societies where immigration and diversity is causing tension. This will include raising awareness of the project outputs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150036</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N016203/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>548B6279-0479-4E80-BC7C-3E5308CF61BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
