This project seeks to return sculpture to centre stage in discussions of 19th-century British culture, and to re-assert the importance of sculpture to Victorian history. It is a collaborative project involving scholars and curators at the Universities of York and Warwick and the Yale Center for British Art, who will host the exhibition, Displaying Victorian Sculpture. The project will also involve the participation of three important regional collections: Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; and National Museum, Cardiff.\n\nThe focus of the project will be the display of sculpture. Sculpture and sculptural objects were ubiquitous in the 19th century, displayed in museums, galleries, public spaces inside and out, and in homes from royal palaces to suburban villas. Encompassing a range of objects from cameo brooches to taxidermic tableaux, from commemorative medals to the fountains at Osborne House, sculpture was visible everywhere. We know little, though, of the display of these objects and their audiences. The examination of sculptural encounters will allow us to move beyond standard approaches, which stress the biographical (the life and work of particular sculptors) and the formal (stylistic schools and borrowings), in two crucial ways:\n\nFirst, it will allow a closer attention to internationalism. Victorian Sculpture was an international business, and artists, patrons, and objects circulated round the globe. Works were often reproduced for new locations, and the period's most widely attended exhibitions all emphasized international contexts and histories. The framework of national schools, which has characterized the discussion of 19th-century sculpture, needs to be replaced by an awareness of the cosmopolitanism of sculptural patronage, production, and display.\n\nThis, in turn, offers new perspectives on the politics of sculpture. Display forces us to address not only the subject and style of, say, Bates's Lord Roberts Memorial, but also, as a monument erected in both Glasgow and Calcutta, how its meaning was determined by the spaces and social rituals surrounding it. In turn, how did the monument give meaning to those spaces? Similarly, the physical culture and dress reform movements insisted on classical sculpture as the moral and aesthetic exemplar to be imitated, and one might ask how the public and private displays of these ideals shaped ideas about class, gender, and nation.\n\nThis complex history will be examined in a set of accessible outcomes. These include the first major international exhibition of Victorian sculpture, along with a catalogue; an edited collection of Victorian visual and textual sources on sculptural display, to be edited by the PRF; and two PhD theses on related themes. One thesis will examine the display of sculpture at international expositions; the other will deal with the royal family and their myriad roles in the promotion of sculpture and its display. While we have a clearly defined set of outcomes, we intend these to function as a springboard to the further development of the field, not least through the careers of the younger scholars involved in the project.\n\nDisplaying Victorian Sculpture will reveal the social life of sculpture in 19th-century Britain; a social life both physical, in its weighty presence in public and private spaces around the world; and conceptual, in its role as aesthetic and moral exemplar, and as political art par excellence. The project will challenge the aesthetic prejudice that has hindered research in the field, and will offer a history of Victorian sculpture in its full visual and conceptual complexity; a history that continues today in debates about the value of civic monuments and museum collections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Not required</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>444660</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Yale University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Yale Center for British Art</gtr:department><gtr:description>Sculpture Victorious</gtr:description><gtr:id>38FEFFA0-3DC5-4D1A-A376-8C9D0EBDAAEA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition

These events generated much discussion, enabled visitors and staff to understand the objects in the exhibition and their historical significance, and encouraged close looking by visitors and staff.

The Education department at the YCBA has conducted tours of the exhibition, as well as a host of activities in the exhibition for families and schools. Most notably, the YCBA's Artism programme - a programme of events for families with children on the autism spectrum - has so far used the exhibition for two workshops with autistic children. 

The YCBA Curator of Sculpture and members of the History of Art faculty at Yale have subsequently given tours to professional groups (both from the Metropolitan Museum, NYC) and to local collectors of ceramics.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The principal impact was through the exhibition Sculpture Victorious: Art in an Age of Invention, 1837-1901. This was shown at the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, in autumn 2014 and the research from the AHRC project completely shaped the exhibition. The key areas in which the research underpinned the exhibition were: sculpture and the British Empire; conceptions of the sculptural in the nineteenth-century; the relationship between art and manufacture; and a revised narrative of sculptural history in the period, eschewing the orthodox stylistic pattern (from 'neo-classicism' to realism to 'the New Sculpture') and pointing to continuities, material and social. 

Tate Britain then took up the exhibition and curated a version of it in spring 2015. The Tate team used the YCBA exhibition as a template, but incorporated more of their own collection into the show, thus re-framing and re-contextualising objects in terms of our research findings. 

In January 2016 a workshop on Thorvaldsen and Britain was held at the Danish Academy in Rome and British School at Rome. This involved scholars from the UK and the US, including the Sculpture Victorious team, and scholars from Thorvaldsens Museum and the University of Copenhagen. Thorvaldsen, the nineteenth-century Danish sculptor, had featured in the original exhibition, and this workshop, co-organised with the Museum, enabled insights and research from the original project to be communicated to scholars from Denmark and particularly those in Thorvaldsens Museum.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1B077D6E-A7CE-45A1-823A-4B213AD65E6C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings of the project were in the following areas:

Sculptural history has often been written as if it were parallel to that of painting. This orthodox model structures history as a series of styles, moving from the apparent neoclassicism of the early century, through romanticism and realism to modern avant-gardismin the guise of the so-called 'New Sculpture'. Our project has revealed that sculpture has an independent history, and is, in fact, more about continuity. Those things that are often said to characterise the proto-modernism of late-nineteenth-century sculpture, such as the use of mixed media, the statuette, and the individual craft object, are all to be found throughout the period. The traditional narrative about Victorian sculpture ignores crucial social and political factors in favour of debates about style, and our project has offered a corrective to that. 

The project also illuminated the political role of sculpture in the UK and across the British Empire, demonstrating that sculpture is the most important visual and material representation of power in the nineteenth century. Our research covered such things as debates in the colonies about monuments to Victoria, the development of coinage across the Empire (since coins are also forms of sculpture), and the circulation of visual representations and reports in the colonial press about sculpture in the UK and other British possessions. 

We also challenged conventional ideas about the relationship of art and industry. Rather than being an aesthetic nadir, we demonstrated that the collaboration of sculptors with industrial manufactures was instead highly productive, both enhancing sculptors' careers and helping to disseminate sculpture to many more people. Sculpture had an audience of millions in Victorian Britain, not least through international exhibitions and displays such as the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, but also through the many reproductions enabled by new print and photographic technologies. Industry had a central role in this attempt to democratise sculpture.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings were used for the first ever synoptic exhibition on Victorian sculpture, which was shown both in the US and the UK.
