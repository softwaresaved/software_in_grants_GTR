This project builds on the success of the Tangible Memories research project, enabling our partners Alive! (a charity dedicated to improving the quality of life for older people in care by enabling their participation in meaningful activity) to continue to work with us to further embed the project outcomes in their practice and in care settings more widely. Community engagement is increasingly recognized by the care sector and commissioners as vital in tackling issues of social isolation in our older populations living in care settings. Together with Alive! we want to co-design engaging community spaces (parlours) where older people can interact with evocative objects and our app to record and share their memories and life histories. This will involve imagining and creating a new space of discovery, connection, meaning making and mystery, rather like the 'cabinets of curiosity' or 'wonder rooms' of old. Unlike cabinets of curiosity, our 'Parlours of Wonder' will not be designed and curated by us as arts and humanities researchers, artists/designers and computer scientists. Our vision is that these spaces will be co-curated by and for residents, care staff, families and community members. Care managers believe there is huge potential to use these Parlours of Wonder for community engagement where local school children, community groups and isolated older people will be encouraged to enjoy a cup of tea and a chat or a more formal encounter, sparking questions, connections, new interests or opportunities for contemplation. 

This project has been jointly conceived and developed with Alive!, with artists and with an extra care facility in which we have worked on the Tangible Memories Project. Funding from that research enabled us to co-design and to test our prototypes in the settings. We believe the prototypes, in particular our app, have huge potential to enhance opportunities for older people living in care homes to connect with those in their local community and therefore feel less socially isolated. We know that this will require a change of culture in many care settings and thus working closely with care staff to co-design new spaces of encounter in these settings is vital. This project builds on and further extend our excellent working relationships with Alive!, Blaise Weston Court (an extra care facility) and Hanover Housing, but will extend our activities to reach new groups including BrunelCare, the Britannia Centre (a day care facility) and Deerhurst (a large care home specializing in dementia work). It will also enable us to work closely with policy makers and other influencers to expand the local and national project reach.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this project will be far reaching and diverse:
Care settings, staff and managers will be provided with a 'blueprint' for the design of Parlours in their settings. They will also have access to a quality training toolkit. Through the careful recording, reflection and evaluation of all our processes we will produce case study reports of each of the sites as a publication viewable online. These case studies will be hosted both on our own TMP website but also on the Alive! website to ensure the widest possible audience. Take up of the ideas will enhance their provision and be looked on favourably by the CQC who inspect care settings nationally. 
Care staff will have an opportunity to work with design partners and researchers to engage creatively in co-designing spaces in their own settings but also in thinking seriously about the future of care settings and their links to communities. They will benefit from further training to develop their expertise in designing and delivering multigenerational activities and in using objects and the app to enhance these activities. 
Care home residents will benefit from engaging creatively with us in co-designing spaces, participating in the multigenerational activities we design, learning more about the use of digital technologies and objects and being encouraged to share their stories with others, particularly those of different generations. We know from the TMP that this often leads to increased confidence, lessens the experience of social isolation and improves quality of life. 
Family members will benefit from being provided with more creative ways to engage with the care settings and their relatives and as we have found on the TMP this can enable them to feel more connected to other the activities going on in the settings and more likely to visit thus potentially decreasing the social isolation of older people. The app draws in grandchildren and great grandchildren who might not currently visit often. 
Young people/schools/community members will benefit from engaging with these creative spaces and from the multigenerational contact that flows through these spaces. The resources provided in the Parlours will enable young people and community members to connect physically with objects from the past and to hear the personal stories associated with the objects that will bring community histories Alive! in new ways. In addition, the contact with older people will provide an important learning opportunity in relation to challenging their preconceptions of older people, perpetuated in the media and elsewhere. 
Bristol Ageing Better, Age UK and policy makers working in this space will gain important data on the process of co-designing care homes for community engagement through the case studies we will produce. We will use these case studies to produce a Policy briefing outlining some of the key issues we experienced in the process of co-designing the spaces and activities which will be distributed through our strong networks. In addition, to ensure the project is well communicated to this audience we will present our case studies and training materials at the local 'Celebrating Age Festival' where we have already publicised the TMP, and at national practitioner events such as the Dementia Congress. 
Museums and galleries have begun to develop connections with older people living in care through several projects (eg Alive!'s innovative work with the Wallace Collection and the Russell Coates Art Gallery and Museum). However there is huge potential in our work using objects to tell stories that would be of interest to curators and other museum staff. Our case studies will provide useful information that could potentially enhance their provision. This will be enhanced through our co-curated exhibition of creative work.
This project will enhance Alive!'s (our partner) offer to care homes thus improving their capacity to develop and grow as a charitable organisation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80630</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N009568/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80A9D6C5-792D-4DD9-9138-BEC1BB556AA9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technology and method dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
