changes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/K005294/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Incoming solar irradiance ultimately governs the amount of energy within the Earth's system. Our understanding of how solar irradiance is modulated by the Earth's orbital pathway underpins our understanding of long-term (&amp;gt;10,000 year) global climate and vegetation change through the geological record. However, there is no independent long-term record empirical record of solar irradiance on timescales &amp;gt;10,000 years. Our proposal is designed to generate the first record of solar irradiance change at the Earth's surface by applying cutting-edge organic geochemical techniques to a unique tropical record of past vegetation change.

Current understanding of solar flux is based upon changes observed in cosmogenic isotopes (10Be and 14C); however, the temporal range over which these techniques can be applied is limited by the half-lives of the respective isotopes. Recent advances in our understanding of pollen/spore chemical composition indicate that a signature of maximum Ultra Violet-B (UV-B) radiation exposure during growth is locked-in, and preserved, within the sporopollenin chemical structure [1]. As UV-B is directly proportional to total incoming solar irradiance this offers an opportunity to extract a long-term record of solar irradiance flux from the fossil pollen/spore record.

During the Quaternary period (last 2.6 million years) orbital forcing has been identified as particularly important in relation to climate and vegetation change associated with glacial-interglacial cycles [2]. However, due to a paucity of appropriate study sites our understanding of terrestrial vegetation change over multiple glacial-interglacial cycles remains limited. New fossil pollen/spore data from a continuous c. 1 million year sedimentary record recovered from Lake Bosumtwi (Ghana), recovered by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program, provides the first terrestrial record of vegetation change in Africa during this period [3]. The Lake Bosumtwi study site offers an ideal opportunity to assess how solar insolation, climate and vegetation have changed through time because it is well placed to record changes in the global climate system (Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, monsoon) and vegetation (shifts between forest and savannah biome are observed in the fossil pollen record).

We will use Fourier Transformed Infra-Red spectroscopy to analyse the chemical structure of c. 15,000 pollen/spores extracted from 500 different depths (ages) in the Lake Bosumtwi sediment record over the last 500,000 years. By characterizing past change in solar irradiance at the Earth's surface and comparing chemical change with existing model and vegetation data we will provide new insights into the pattern of change. The independent record of solar irradiance will allow climate and vegetation change inferences to be decoupled within the fossil record. Therefore, we will have the potential to determine leads and lags (causality) within the Earth's system, e.g. how do shifts in climate systems related to vegetation change.

The research team have all the requisite skills and experience to deliver the proposal: Gosling (PI OU) has worked on past environmental change in the tropics for 12 years and has worked on Lake Bosumtwi sediments since 2007; Lomax (PI Univ. Nottingham) and Fraser (Res Co-I OU) are organic geochemists who have pioneered research into pollen/spore chemical composition change and its preservation in the geological record. The Centre for Earth, Planetary, Space &amp;amp; Astronomical Research (The OU) will provide the required facilities and research environment.

The program of impact activity will draw on the expert scientific knowledge of the research team and science communication skills of Karen and other education professionals linked within BES education network. Our overarching impact objective is to deliver science lead educational material based on our research to teachers and students in the UK and Ghana (the country in which our research samples originate from).

WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH? 
The primary users will include teachers of science students (12-18 years) and undergraduates. It is intended that identification and targeting of these groups does not exclude other groups or more broad public engagement. The resources and activities developed are intended to ensure greater student engagement with novel research and its application to a real world context. There is significant emphasis (and longer term sustainable impact) placed on training educators of these groups in the UK and Ghana to strengthen understanding of past environmental change and modelling future changes.

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?
Four activities will be undertaken to communicate the scientific outputs from this proposal to non-academics.

a) A video of the scientific &amp;quot;learning journey&amp;quot; will be created covering key methodologies and techniques (including field research) to be undertaken by the core research team. The video will be translated, by education professionals, into linked teaching resources suitable for use at a range of levels. The video and resources will be hosted on the education section of the BES website.

b) An educational wall chart will be produced focused on Past Environmental Change related to the proposed research. The content will cover the basic scientific techniques, key scientific concepts, outcomes of the research and remaining scientific questions. The wall chart will be developed with professional designers and educationalists to ensure that the message is communicated clearly. The existing BES educational network will be used to disseminate copies of wall charts free to all secondary schools in the UK and selected institutions in Ghana; in total 10,000 copies of the wall chart will be produced and distributed.

c) Training and capacity building activities will focus on Ghanaian project partners at the Forestry Research Institute of Ghana, including training and provision of equipment to improve herbarium facilities at the Institute. In addition, as part of the personal development of the Researcher Co-I training in media and science communication is planned.

d) To make research progress and findings available to a wide range of people reports will be advertised through the host research groups existing online presence:

the Earth's surface.
- A strong relationship between the chemical response observed in plants due to exposure to specific wavelengths of solar radiation and long-term, orbitally-driven cycles in solar input to the Earth system has been identified by this work (Jardine et al. 2016, Scientific Reports 6, 10.1038/srep39269).


Objective 2: To identify if vegetation assemblage shifts occur coincidently with changes solar irradiance.
- A key element to addressing this objective first requires a deep understanding of how vegetation assemblages are defined. PhD student Julier has made considerable headway in developing an understanding of existing vegetation distributions, and has characterised the different vegetation assemblages found across Ghana. This knowledge is now being 
combined with previously generated pollen analysis of the Lake Bosumtwi fossil record (Miller et al. 2016, J. Quat. Sci. 31(7), 671-677) to elucidate how clearly fossil records represent the true nature of the actual vegetation distribution. 


Objective 3: To move palynology (study of pollen/spores) beyond the 'classical' taxonomic approach, as pioneered by von Post,
and advance organo-chemical palynology techniques to allow integration of this method into multi-proxy past environmental
change reconstructions.
- The project team have continued to develop and refine the chemical-based approach used here to determine past changes in solar input to the Earth system. Notably, investigations into the impact of oxidation on palynological samples (pollen and spores) have revealed preferred preparation protocols (Jardine et al. 2015, J. MicroPal. 34(2), 139-149), the influence of geological processes on changing pollen/spore chemistry enables a broader selection of existing palynological samples to be analysed in the future (Fraser et al. 2014, Rev. Pal. Pal. 201, 41-46), and the technicalities of sporopollenin chemistry has been investigated, demonstrating that the specific chemical signal being tracked by our technique is robust (Jardine et al. 2017, Rev. Pal. Pal. 238, 1-6).
- The project has also published two articles aimed at a broader, non-specialist audience to expand the potential user-base of our technique (Fraser et al. 2014, Frontiers in Ecol. Evol. 2, 10.3389/fevo.2014.00012; Lomax &amp;amp; Fraser 2015, Palaeontology 58, 759-768).
- Developments beyond simply determining past changes in solar radiation budget have also been made; Julier et al. 2016 (Rev. Pal. Pal. 235, 140-147) demonstrates how our chemical analyses can also be used to differentiate between different groupings with the grass (Poaceae) family.


Objective 4: To apply organo-chemical palynology to a fossil pollen/spore record spanning multiple Quaternary glacial-interglacial
cycles for the first time.
- We have achieved this objective fully; Jardine et al. (2016, Scientific Reports 6, 10.1038/srep39269). A follow-up paper investigating a higher resolution, shorter-term record is currently in preparation too.


Objective 5: To compile an assessment of the role of TSI in influencing climate and vegetation change.
- This is the final objective to complete (along with part of Objective 6); the final stages of the project are to be dedicated to delivering this.


Objective 6: To share the obtained data with the past environmental change research community and Earth system modellers.
- This is an ongoing task to the end of the project.
- To date six peer-reviewed articles have been published, all of which appear as Open Access articles, as well as being deposited in online repositories at each institution involved in the project.
- A further twenty seven contributions to international conferences have been delivered by various members of the project team, reaching out to specialist audiences in organic geochemistry and vegetation dynamics, as well as broader interest audiences at multi-disciplinary conferences (e.g. EGU).
- Regular updates on project progress continue to appear on Ecology of the Past blog and YouTube channels.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- Multiple other international research groups have already our techniques to existing records.
- European collaborations are currently being set up by various members of the project to continue to application of our chemo-taxonomic approaches.
- The PDRA who was employed on this grant for three years is about to start a new position that involves some time dedicated to continuing a variety of applications of the methods from this project.
- PI Fraser and Co-I Lomax are Co-I's on a NERC-NSFC funded project under the 'Biosphere Evolution, Transitions and Resilience (BETR)' programme that applies the solar irradiance reconstruction techniques from this project to substantially older fossil material (Permo-Triassic boundary mass extinction
