The game is a fun and interactive way of introducing non-academic audiences to ideas from historical and contemporary science and medicine. The card game will be available both in hard copy and as an online resource. Players are challenged to sort medical facts and theories into three categories: Current Model, Disproved and Fictional and can play against one another as both individuals and teams. Simple and entertaining, it invites questions as to the value and purpose of history and introduces participants to new scholarship from the Constructing Scientific Communities (Conscicom) project. 

This project builds upon a game that has been used as an occasional museum event to create a new educational resource to teach critical thinking and research skills to museum visitors, tertiary health care students and school students. It will also be made accessible to the general public. Accompanying guidance will help teachers and educators use the physical game in classroom sessions, while interested adults and school audiences will use the online game at home and school. The expanded resource will be developed with the help of specialists including museum practitioners and health care educators, and students and teachers will be involved in the testing.

The card game will be distributed to nursing lecturers, librarians and museum practitioners. The online resource will be freely available via the high profile citizen science portal Zooniverse (www.zooniverse.org) who are already project partners on Conscicom. The game, and feedback from it, will also help inform learning activities for the Science Museum's new medical galleries, due for completion in 2019. 

By using the game to experiment with and evaluate public perceptions of medicine, Mind-Boggling Medical History focuses on an important objective of Conscicom: to enhance understanding of public engagement with science since the late Victorian era and to break down divisions between professional science and the public. Furthermore, it promises to be an innovative way of carrying out interdisciplinary work, showing how historical facts and theories can be used to prompt questions about current day understandings of medicine, the need for health practitioners to stay up to date in their field, and the impact changes in medical knowledge can have on patient care.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Mind-Boggling Medical History is an innovative, fun, flexible public engagement tool designed to open up medical history to general audiences. Principally, it is a way for those who are not humanities scholars, including museum professionals, museum audiences, healthcare educators and students and younger audiences to engage critically with medical humanities. It is also a method of bringing research emerging from Constructing Scientific Communities to new and diverse audiences through discussion, debate and dissemination.

Originally constructed as a card game to be hosted by its creators at museum events, Follow-on Funding would enable the transformation of the facilitated game into a standalone resource that can be be played without the assistance of an academic expert and which may be adapted to suit a range of audiences and environments. The resource will come in two formats, both of which will be developed with direct involvement of members of the target audiences, as well as other relevant experts in each field, such as museum curators. The first is a card game and will be targeted at museum professionals, healthcare educators and their students. Using a hard copy of the game means it can be easily played at interactive and outreach events hosted by museums or by groups of students in seminars or even at home. The hard copy format also enables us to create a beautifully designed, attractive set of cards (with sufficient cards for 5 separate rounds of the game), with accompanying instructions for educators including ideas for questions and debates following on from the topics raised. The project will investigate the potential of selling this commercially via museum shops and other selected outlets, in order to ensure that the resource can continue to be made available after the end of the grant.

As well as this, there will be a freely available online resource with accompanying instructions and guidance. The online version will be built via the Zooniverse platform (www.zooniverse.org), a citizen science portal which currently has over 1 million registered volunteers and with a high media profile. The online version is intended for use as an introduction to classroom settings, as homework for students or to be played by individual visitors in a museum gallery or at home. The online version will also have links to additional information so that players may find out more about any of the medical facts or theories on the cards.

Targeted dissemination and marketing will ensure that the game reaches the intended audiences. The project partners are well-placed to maximise impact to these groups, through established routes of communication. The Science Museum is visited by 175,000 Key Stage 3 &amp;amp; 4 children each year, the Museum of the History of Science has over 180,000 annual vistors, while the Royal College of Nursing has nearly 41,000 student members and an active network of nursing teachers and lecturers. The game will be promoted through email and print campaigns and in-person visits to the Science Museum, Museum of the History of Science and RCN Library &amp;amp; Heritage Centre.

The game is intended to stimulate players' interest in - and broaden their knowledge of - historical and contemporary medicine. It is also a pedagogical tool designed to aid criticial thinking about the role of history, and the difference between past and current medical theories and practices. 

As well as informing and disseminating, evaluation metrics derived from the online version of the game and during the workshops piloting the game, will be critical in enabling future public engagement projects to use our findings to improve their own.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33799</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P014194/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
