Therefore, the future in materials design relies on our ability to control nanoscale structures. To achieve this, a vital tool for material scientist is x-ray diffraction as it allows in-depth characterisation of the crystal structure.

Here we propose to establish an x-ray diffractometer dedicated to nanoscale and thin film structure with a set of capabilities which will enable material scientist to study the structural properties of polycrystalline and epitaxial films and probe the interface quality and structure which often dictates the performance and functionality of the nanoscale material. The high throughput capability offered by this equipment will play a vital role in atomic scale design of functional materials and process optimisation for integration in device. It will enable the routine measurement of phase purity, crystalline quality, thickness and roughness using non-destructive method. More advanced measurements will be used to determine epitaxial relationship and texture of the nanostructures. The materials studied have applications in renewable energy (photovoltaic, battery, thermoelectric), electronic (transparent conducting oxides, dielectrics, semiconductor alloys)</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The new x-ray diffraction instrument that is requested in this application underpins a large number of scientific programs. The underlying capabilities enabled by the equipment are vital for the development of advanced functional materials which have been recognised as one of the UK &amp;quot;Eight great technologies&amp;quot;. The impact of the proposed equipment will be in the following areas:

(1) Economy
The non-destructive high throughput characterisation of nanostructures enabled by the proposed equipment is central to the discovery of advanced functional materials and its integration in the supply chain in surface engineering and advanced films &amp;amp; coatings will enable accelerated commercialisation of novel devices and lead to the development of new technologies. This will be accompanied by job creation and enhance the future competiveness of the UK industry in the field of advanced functional materials. Usage of the proposed equipment will contribute to this development through generating knowledge and intellectual property that will be exploited in this long-term development. 

(2) Society
The fundamental principle behind the requested equipment, x-ray scattering, is widely used in everyday medical application. Linking large scale facilities such as synchrotron radiation sources to this physical principle will contribute in educating the wider society on the possibilities to explore the atomic scale arrangement of matter. We have a successful strategy for outreach event using the EPSRC mid-range facility XMaS with a particular focus on tackling the gender bias in Physics.

(3) Knowledge Exchange
The project will train young researchers who will acquire the necessary skills to contribute to the future economic development outlined above. These skills will include specific knowledge in x-ray scattering method as well as more generic skills such as effective communication, project and time management.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>360000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The primary objective of this grant was to establish a new x-ray diffraction facility at the University of Liverpool with the procurement of a state-of-the-art instrument.
