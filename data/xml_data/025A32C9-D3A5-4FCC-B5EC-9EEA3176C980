Effective tobacco control effects can help prevent kinds of diseases and social-economic disasters which may happen on smokers of non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke. In China, internal rural-to-urban migrant (mostly migrant workers) makes a large proportion of the whole population, accounting for about 0.24 billion in 2012. This migrant workers population has a serious situation of tobacco exposure.

We first propose to design a package tailoring the WHO 5A's model into 5A's group consulting intervention package through literature review, in-depth interview and focus group discussion.

The 5A's group consulting package intervention would include:
1. Factsheets detailing key information on smoking, SHS.
2. Guidelines for group guiders on how to deliver the 5A's group consulting (activities for different audiences: smokers, non-smokers exposed to SHS).
3. A leaflet that contains the key facts about smoking and SHS that can be disseminated to migrant workers after consulting.

Based on the package desigend, we aim to recruit 8 factories (clusters) and all the migrant workers working in these factories from industrial zone of Guangzhou, China. The clusters will be randomized to the intervention and control group in a 1:1 ratio. Clusters allocated to the intervention arm will be offered the 5A's group consulting package. The clusters in the control arm will not be offered the package until the completion of the study. All the migrant workers who work in each factory and provides informed consent will be recruited. Factories will complete a factory survey of basic factory information, all participants will complete a questionnaire (about the status of tobacco exposure, knowledge and attitude of tobacco, and demographic information), and a non-smoking individual will provide a salvia sample which will be tested for cotinine. All these participant outcomes (questionnaire and salvia cotinine) will be measured before and after the 3-month intervention in both arms of the trial. In addition, a purposive sample of participants will be invited for interviews to investigate the facilitators and barriers for integrating 5A's group consulting package into workplace settings and how these can be enhanced or addressed at the end of this trial.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>First, the package would be designed by tailoring the WHO 5A's model into 5A's group consulting intervention package through literature review, in-depth interview and focus group discussion.

At individual level, participants will get a better knowledge of tobacco hazards, benefits of quitting, and methods about quitting. They may benefit from quitting, reducing of SHS contact, and encouraging people around them to quit.
At factory level, improvement of workers' tobacco control concept will facilitate the development and implementation of tobacco-free factory regulation. Evidence shows that the tobacco-free regulation has long lasting effects to reduce the smoking rate among workers and smoking intensity of those smokers.
If the effect and cost-effective could be approved by the larger study, the government would have approved tools to help reduce the tobacco exposure of migrant workers in industrial settings.
The economic benefit from tobacco manufacturing and taxing, and the monopoly position of tobacco industry tended to be the most crucial obstacle to the effective implementation of the FCTC in China. Therefore, efforts in health sector should provide useful supplement to the general tobacco control policy, because health and tobacco sectors are relatively independent with each other.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>133584</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>public lecture on tobacco control</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B224F706-3A3B-466C-BC0C-55B5C4AC30B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two rounds of open lectures were held in the two selected intervention factories, which provided information on the harms of smoking, mechnism of tobacco addiction, benefit and barries to quit smoking, how to successfully quit smoking. 78 and 65 currently smoking workers, most of whom were migrants, attended the lectures, which sparked questions and disccusion afterwards. A printed manual/ leaflet on tobacco control were distributed during the lecture. The lectures increased smoking workers' knowledge about tobacco control and helped them to make decision and take action to quit smoking.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>social media intervention</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D815B1A0-387C-49AB-B52D-678F663639C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In order to support the 5 A smoking cessation intervention, and reinforce the influence of the intervention, a multi-channel social media method were employed in this study.

We designed and adpated a 5A's group consulting package, which has potentials to be implemented in the workplaces settings in China. This study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a workplace-based migrant-workers intervention program of the 5A's and aims to provide information to inform the future design of RCT. 
The adapted 5A's model was designed into an operational guideline and a training module was developed. 
In each intervention factory, several team leaders were selected from the migrant workers and were trained to conduct the 5A smoking cessation intervention and follow-up within their teams. 
Other supportive interventions include public health education lectures, posters/leaflets and social medias.</gtr:description><gtr:id>61292D3D-A9E6-4875-8641-7741ABF36DBA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At individual level, participants(i.e., migrant workers) have improved their knowledge of tobacco hazards, benefits and methods of smoking cessation. They have also reduced second hand smoking contact, and encouraged their workmates around them to quit. Our initial analysis shows that, a total of 51 workers in the intervention group have taken action to quit smoking, accounting for 71.8% of smoking participants, and 20(39%) of them have successfully stopped smoking. The smoking rate has been reduced from 51.2% to 46.6% in intervention group.
At the factory level, improvement of workers' tobacco control awareness has facilitated the development and implementation of tobacco-free factory regulations. Evidence shows that the tobacco-free regulations have long lasting effects to reduce the smoking rate among workers and smoking intensity of those smokers. 
At the policy level, the piloting processes have improved the awareness of local health system to implement the smoking cessation activities among the factories.
