Fundamental to the conceptual work underlying the research is the understanding that the category of home is both a profoundly intuitive, universally significant concept and a multi-faceted and elusive one. Whatever their situations, cultural or religious beliefs or ethnicities, many people have a broadly similar, expansive idea of home. Defining it objectively is often problematic, yet having a sense of what home is, and being able to lay claim to what it means, is fundamental to our idea of what it is to be human. Understanding and representing home involves an act of the imagination. Home is a place of belonging and familiarity. It might be conceived of as the place where family and friends are, or where someone grew up, or where they long to return. Frequently, ideas of home and of community are almost synonymous. Communities can be seen as an extension of family and home in which some of the key values, markers and affiliations of home remain significant, such as religion, food, languages, ethnicity, individual and community histories.

The project involves mingling affective responses with more specific ideas of physical space and environment, material culture, nation and postnation in a rapidly changing world. By asking and developing answers to key questions we will contribute new analyses of pressing national and international challenges about belonging, identity, citizenship and society. How does the experience of mobility transform a particular idea of home into one characterised by multiplicity and plurality? Here we consider imagining more than one place as home. Is home increasingly a mythic site in a postnational order, belonging to a nostalgically imagined and static past in which things were better, safer and more familiar? We ask whether it is ever possible to return home. What kind of a place is home in an increasingly technologised neoliberal twenty-first century? Here we reflect upon the transformations technology makes to our experiences of home. What is the relationship between home and exile, home and diaspora, or home and migrancy? We consider processes of unhoming and the condition of homelessness and laying claim to a new home. What role does the imagination have to play in conceiving of relationships between home and communities and does home continue to have a vibrant future as a place into which citizens can project themselves and shape imagined lives within just and fair societies? Here we consider the transformative possibilities of acts of the imagination. 

The arts and humanities can make significant contributions to existing research from the social sciences. By focusing on the role of the work that the imagination and representation - key categories for research in literary studies - can perform on home, it is possible to develop more productive and nuanced understandings of how communities conceive of themselves, how they create and sustain creative connections, how they foster their most profoundly affective elements. Understanding and investigating communities in these terms adds depth to conceiving of their interconnectedness. It draws attention to the relationship between the home as an imaginary and imagined category and the imaginary nature of representation and literary studies themselves. It also helps in analysing those changing points of tension and disjunction which can often be best articulated and interpreted through powerful acts of the imagination.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research has the potential to benefit an unusually wide array of groups and organisations because of its focus on home, a category of such obvious human significance. Imagining the Place of Home has a specific focus and remit: to produce a research review of arts and humanities research on home. While this means that in principle, opportunities for wider impact are not as obvious as they would be for less review-focused work, we have tailored our project to allow for non-academic beneficiaries to be involved. Particularly, they will participate in two workshops in which we will reflect on planning the shape of the research review and then reviewing its outcomes in order to refine and develop future research, including grant applications with partner organisations. The close involvement of partners with which the PI has already worked closely, the Harry Guntrip Psychotherapy Trust, the Stanley and Audrey Burton Gallery and Opera North, is significant here. The Geffrye, Museum of the Home, the Centre for Studies of Home and the Subject Specialist Network Histories of Home are potential participants and have expressed an interest in the project, notably its focus on imagination. 

The workshops will create opportunities for interactions between academic researchers and professionals in the culture and heritage industries to stimulate new collaboratons, projects and funding bids and develop existing relationships including a strong public engagement element. Crucially, too, it will ensure that the imperatives of non-academic partners wil be given the fullest consideration at each stage of the project. See Pathways to Impact for a detailed account of how this will be achieved.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29653</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>26378</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Networking</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>5F67C47E-EE98-4D5B-8B5D-CBB17D5BB553</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>They have contributed to discussion held with Opera North in relation to projects to which the PI has contributed.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DA714DBD-E349-4855-9D5A-5D4841DBA5B8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed our understanding of the critical contribution the humanities can make to work on home.
