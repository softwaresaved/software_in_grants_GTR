Surprisingly little research has examined recovery from the patient?s perspective and there has been much less research on patients? experiences of injury compared with that of illness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will undertake a secondary analysis, using thematic and narrative approaches, of 163 qualitative interviews from four datasets. Three datasets are from the Health Experiences Research Group archive, University of Oxford, and the fourth is from the UK Burden of Injury Study. Key aims include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>examination of socially constructed notions of ?normal? and ?getting back to normal? within patients? accounts&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>comparison of patients? expectations and experiences of recovery from four types of health event (heart attacks, leukaemia, serious injury requiring hospitalisation and a critical state of health requiring admission to intensive care).&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The research findings and implications for policy and practice will be discussed with stakeholders at a dissemination day conference held at the end of the project and disseminated via a website, conference presentations and in a range of publications for practitioner and academic audiences.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will generate knowledge and understanding of patients' experiences following three different situations of serious illness (heart attack, leukaemia and conditions leading to a stay in intensive care) and serious injury requiring hospital admission. This will have potential impact on healthcare policy, service planning and provision, and professional practice. The research findings will be of particular relevance to individuals and organisations concerned with patient recovery from the four types of health event studied. Potential beneficiaries from the research include: (1) those in the Department of Health, clinical commissioning groups and the health care sector concerned with the provision of support to patients recovering from a serious illness or injury; (2) voluntary organisations and patient groups, in particular those focused on the types of health event studied; (3) health care professionals working in primary care and hospital settings (notably intensive care, cardiology, clinical oncology, trauma and rehabilitation); (4) Royal Colleges and other institutions involved in professional leadership and training; (5) those concerned with return-to-work support and policies - including employers, human resources and occupational health staff and trade unions; (6) academics engaged in social research on experiences of illness, injury and recovery, rehabilitation, survivorship and professional practice. 
 
The main benefits to government, health sector and voluntary sector organisations will be better knowledge of how people experience and make sense of recovery. The project will lead to an understanding of how the type of health event, the journey into patienthood, and personal characteristics such as gender, age and socio-economic circumstances and resources may create variations in experiences of recovery and the types of support required and valued. The research findings will be relevant to service planning at a national and local level, the co-ordination of primary and secondary care, and projects focused on specific types of health event.

The project will have a potential impact on professional practice by illustrating how lay understandings may differ from those of health care professionals and how the style and content of professional-lay interactions may affect patient experiences of recovery. Enhanced understanding of patient expectations of recovery will also improve the advice and support given to patients at different stages of the recovery process. 
 
For employers, occupational health services, trade unions and others involved in the lives of employees recovering from a serious health event, the project will provide new understandings of the multi-dimensional nature of recovery, the difficulties people may face returning to paid employment, and the ways in which work environments may assist or hinder recovery. 
 
The impact of the research on individuals recovering from a serious illness or injury and their families will be mainly indirect, through improved understanding and changes in provision and practice. Key audiences for dissemination of findings will include organisations that represent patients at a national and local level such as the Patients' Association and National Voices. 
 
A website will be established at the beginning of the project to promote discussion and disseminate findings. A key task for the Advisory Group will be to advise the investigators on how to maximise the impact of the research for service provision and professional practice. Details of proposed outputs and dissemination activities - including a stakeholder dissemination day conference in central London, conference presentations and publications - are provided in the Impact Plan. 
 
The project will contribute to capacity building via development of the skills of the Research Fellow at Surrey, particularly in giving conference papers and writing journal articles.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>235848</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Thomas, H., Earthy, S. and Sleney, J.

Membership included social scientists (Prof Michael Bury, Prof Sue Ziebland), health care practitioners (Dr Stephen Brett, Consultant in Intensive Care and President, Intensive Care Society; Dr Mike Walton, GP; Jan Keenan, Consultant Nurse, Cardiac Medicine; Liz Minton, cancer support specialist); policy analyst (Catherine Foot, King's Fund); patient representatives (Amanda Eastell-Bleakley; Helen Clothier; Roswyn Hakesley-Brown, former Chair, Patients' Association).

A project website www.gettingbacktonormal.org.uk/ publicises the work of the project. To date 15 conference papers and presentations have been given to diverse international, national and local audiences from social science, health professional and lay backgrounds. Work is underway on publications for practitioner and academic audiences. The Advisory Board has offered advice on the dissemination stage of the project to help maximise the reach of key findings. 

A Stakeholder Conference was held at the King's Fund, London, on 24 March 2015 where issues raised by the findings were discussed with health professionals and social scientists. Speakers included Dr Stephen Brett and Amanda Eastell-Bleakley from the project Advisory Board; Dame Jenni Murray, broadcaster and journalist; Bernie Byrne, Head of Maggie's West London cancer support centre; Neil Churchill, Director for Patient Experience, NHS England; Ruth Ten Hove, Head of Research and Development at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy; Susanna Everton, Vice President and Regional Director (London) of the Association of Occupational Health Nurse Practitioners.

Following on from the Stakeholder Conference, close links have been made with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy with regard to professional training and with intensive care specialists in relation to support for patients and their families. The research team will seek to continue to engage with diverse professional groups for whom the research findings have particular relevance.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>56E98989-B459-4F8E-89B6-E94A5C2F53CA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project undertook secondary analysis of 165 qualitative interviews from four datasets: three on patients' experiences of heart attack, leukaemia and intensive care (n=120) from the archive of the Health Experiences Research Group, University of Oxford; and the fourth from the UK Burden of Injury Study (n=45). The analysis involved detailed comparison of patients' accounts of recovery within the context of the four types of health event, examination of notions of 'normal' and 'getting back to normal' within accounts and exploration of the effects of social characteristics on processes and experiences of recovery. The research aims and analytical approach adopted have been orientated towards making a theoretical contribution towards sociological understanding of recovery from major physical illness and injury and an empirical contribution to health service policy and practice in terms of the support needs of patients and their families during recovery.

The concept of 'work' offers a fruitful way of understanding the diverse tasks, roles and duties undertaken by patients during recovery. The work of recovery has physical, emotional, social and moral dimensions and is moulded by the setting in which the patient is located e.g. intensive care or other specialist unit, a general or other hospital ward, at home and on returning to work. Patients are required to understand and engage with treatment and rehabilitation, to get well as quickly and completely as they can and to keep well. They have to manage interactions with and the expectations of others (professionals, family, friends and work colleagues), make sense of what has happened to them and make decisions about whether, when and to what degree they resume pre-event roles and activities. The type of health event creates some specific forms of work, such as adopting a healthier lifestyle (heart attack), maintaining healthy blood counts (leukaemia), coming to terms with hallucinations (intensive care) or regaining use of and confidence in an injured limb (injury). 

A key research aim was to explore notions of 'normal' and 'getting back to normal' in patients' accounts of recovery. 'Feeling more myself' involved emotional as well as physical recovery. Patients were affected emotionally by memories of the event, the significance of the diagnosis, experiences of treatment, pain and other physical symptoms, immobility/disability, dependence, isolation, the slowness and uncertainty of recovery, loss of trust in their bodies and the impact of the illness or injury on important relationships and aspects of identity. The twin concepts of 'recovery from' and 'recovery to' help illuminate patients' experiences of returning to normal life or adjustment to a life altered by illness or injury. For many, the return to paid employment was of central importance - financially and symbolically - and interviewees reported wide variation in the support received from employers. Ideas about time structured interviewees' experience of recovery and acted as a resource for the generation of meaning. Different conceptualisations of time provide a useful framework for consideration of multiple dimensions of recovery (physical, emotional, social) and the ways in which external events, such as a health check, could provide a temporary challenge to the status of recovered health.

Experiences of recovery were further moulded by variation in the socio-economic and other resources available to interviewees to meet diverse support needs during recovery. Lack of informal social support or anxiety not to overburden family and friends affected interviewees' feelings of isolation and inhibited the regaining of confidence. Structured support, for example cardiac rehabilitation programmes and patient support groups, was valued. Availability of provision varied, however, and there appeared to be least provision for injury and some intensive care patients.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are of interest to health professionals, to inform practice, the education of trainees and continuing professional development. Presentations to date of the findings at conferences for health professionals have sparked considerable interest amongst physiotherapists, intensive care specialists and nurses amongst others. 

The conceptual findings will be of interest to sociologists of health and illness, for whom this provides insight into an under-researched aspects of patients' experiences and expectations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AFEA9E65-B7AD-4410-860B-18D0073F6D2E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.gettingbacktonormal.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Stakeholder Day Conference Conference organised for health professionals and social scientists: Patients' Experiences and Expectations</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8FEE292A-3952-40C9-B793-540F5B08B5B6</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DB06F2B7-F3EF-4C2A-A7EB-B1B9A74510EF"><gtr:id>DB06F2B7-F3EF-4C2A-A7EB-B1B9A74510EF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Narratives of recovery from major illness or injury: core narratives and missing scripts</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/51a64f936fa4ed8a49ebf335fef2779a"><gtr:id>51a64f936fa4ed8a49ebf335fef2779a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Earthy S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8DDA1073-D102-4E50-B868-FE78217D24C8"><gtr:id>8DDA1073-D102-4E50-B868-FE78217D24C8</gtr:id><gtr:title>After ICU : the longer-term experiences of patients following discharge</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9484611ab80b1847542bb46f4704fd1b"><gtr:id>9484611ab80b1847542bb46f4704fd1b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thomas H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/25B933D3-ACBA-45A8-968D-BADB284AE9AF"><gtr:id>25B933D3-ACBA-45A8-968D-BADB284AE9AF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Patients' perceptions of a changing body: coming to terms with heart attack</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/973915224eca0d982d0850a3a81b5ed6"><gtr:id>973915224eca0d982d0850a3a81b5ed6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sleney J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/718A834A-C9E4-4B2F-BEB0-DFCC96BA2856"><gtr:id>718A834A-C9E4-4B2F-BEB0-DFCC96BA2856</gtr:id><gtr:title>Temporal landscapes in patients' expectations and experiences of recovery from serious illness or injury</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9484611ab80b1847542bb46f4704fd1b"><gtr:id>9484611ab80b1847542bb46f4704fd1b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thomas H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/701CD4CF-7C0F-43E8-924D-3F64F98BD4D6"><gtr:id>701CD4CF-7C0F-43E8-924D-3F64F98BD4D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding recovery from illness: Challenges for medical sociology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9484611ab80b1847542bb46f4704fd1b"><gtr:id>9484611ab80b1847542bb46f4704fd1b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thomas H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/31A8F24F-AA9F-4572-8838-6676736F286F"><gtr:id>31A8F24F-AA9F-4572-8838-6676736F286F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Expectations and experiences of recovery in the context of leukaemia</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/51a64f936fa4ed8a49ebf335fef2779a"><gtr:id>51a64f936fa4ed8a49ebf335fef2779a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Earthy S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EED09C63-DFD2-41C6-81D2-1E677D6FA000"><gtr:id>EED09C63-DFD2-41C6-81D2-1E677D6FA000</gtr:id><gtr:title>Conceptualising recovery from serious illness or injury</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9484611ab80b1847542bb46f4704fd1b"><gtr:id>9484611ab80b1847542bb46f4704fd1b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thomas H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7FD06687-8CD2-488A-B0B4-BA2CADACFFFC"><gtr:id>7FD06687-8CD2-488A-B0B4-BA2CADACFFFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Getting back to normal?
