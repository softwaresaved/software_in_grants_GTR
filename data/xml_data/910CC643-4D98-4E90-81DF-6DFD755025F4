To achieve the Department for Energy and Climate Change?s aim of reducing UK greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, UK citizens will have to permanently change their behaviour to use significantly less carbon-intensive products and services and to reduce overall energy demand.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research aims to provide policy makers with a clearer understanding of what factors in people?s lives influence and shape how green they are in what they think and what they do.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project uses ?Understanding Society? (the UK Household Longitudinal Survey) to analyse similarities in pro-environmental behaviours across household members and identify the key factors influencing the overall environmental behaviour/impact of the household. It investigates the impact of changing family structure, changing economic conditions and changes in the local environment (neighbourhood or region) on energy use, and explore the impact of environmental ?events? and media coverage of those events on attitudes and behaviours.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project also explores the possibility of linking Understanding Society data to the Department of Energy and Climate Change national household energy consumption data to provide a unique dataset for future use.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic beneficiaries of this research will include a wide range of organisations and individuals, operating at several levels:

- Government researchers and policy makers. Findings about the drivers of, and barriers to, pro-environmental behaviour will be of central relevance to a number of policy areas, notably the carbon-reduction and energy demand objectives of DECC, but also key policy areas for DEFRA and DfT. Findings will also be of relevance to policies across several other UK government departments, including DCMS, MoJ, Home Office, DCSF, BIS, DH, DWP and DfE. At an operational level a number of agencies and committees involved in shaping government consumers will be direct consumers of the findings, including BERR and the Environmental Audit Committee. EU policy-makers should also find the findings relevant and helpful as may the policy community in other countries, in so far as it can be assumed that the findings are transferable beyond UK boundaries.
- Carbon reduction agencies. Organisations tasked with reducing carbon emissions and/or managing energy demand will be able to use some of the findings to target their own strategies. These include the Energy Saving Trust, the Carbon Trust, Housing Energy Adviser, and WRAP.
- Local government officers and councillors. County, borough and unitary authorities in the UK are responsible for services relevant to the subject of this research, notably recycling, and have influence over several others, including the provision of local transport and walking and cycling infrastructure, through local planning frameworks, transport plans, and planning decisions. Many also have a carbon strategy and aim to influence public environment-related behaviour.
- NGOs, think tanks, charities. Campaigning research organisations such as the New Economics Foundation, IPPR, the Green Economics Institute and Demos (an many others too numerous to list) are likely to find the project findings informative for their own work.
- Political parties. The relevance of the research to policy at all levels (European, UK, local authority) means that interest can be expected from parties developing their own policies and manifestos.
- Energy companies. Drivers of energy use by consumers is at the heart of much of the research, which should therefore be useful to energy companies as they develop their own pricing and demand management policies and consumer behaviour campaigns.
- Retail businesses. Findings on factors affecting the purchase of recycled products should be of interest to businesses selling such products as well as the product manufacturers. The findings could have implications for advertising, production and location strategies.
- General public. Many members of the general public will have an interest in the findings, which will help them to locate their own attitudes and behaviours within the population distribution.
- Society as a whole. Ultimately, if the research positively influences policy in any of the areas mentioned above, society as a whole should benefit through improved quality of life. This could occur via several channels, such as delayed impact of climate change, reduction in environmental degradation, reduction in (energy-related) inequality, improved energy security, reduced fuel bills and improved transportation options.

The direct impacts on many of these beneficiaries could be rapid. Notably, campaigning organisations and those tasked with stimulating behaviour change are able to adapt their messaging and their strategies quickly, once convinced of the likely efficacy of doing so. Impacts on policy debates could similarly be rapid, though impacts on policy itself will take longer to filter through the review and revision process. The indirect impacts on society as a whole (via the effect of policies and practices influenced by the research) will accrue only in the long-term, perhaps after decades and even then difficult to detect and to ascribe causation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>134141</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Residential energy use and the relevance of changes in household circumstances (S Longhi talk to final dissemination workshop London June 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AFC2673-B386-479D-81E5-FAEB83D42EF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>40 people attended the workshop and discussed the results of this research

We provided evidence on the importance of occupancy levels and co-habitation in the per capita (and overall) reduction of energy demand implying a need to consider cross-departmental policies that can mitigate the demographic trend for increased sole-occupancy dwellings. We also provided a better understanding of joint and dynamic decision making and constraints in couple and multi-person households where the needs of others need to be accommodated. Our findings highlight the need to look beyond information campaigns designed to manipulate social attitudes as these seem to have little relationship with pro-environmental behaviour.

We have used various ways to disseminate our results and to engage with various types of audiences. We have produced several non-technical summaries and podcasts explaining the results of our research. The summaries and podcasts are freely available to download from the project webpage.

We have discussed the results of our analysis in various circumstances and with various stakeholders. We held a Project Stakeholders Group Meeting in London in June 2013; besides the project investigators and other academics, we had participants from the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), British Gas, Natural England. Other interested stakeholders who could not participate to this meeting received electronic versions of the presentation and the minutes of the meeting; among these: Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Scottish Government, AlertMe, Sustainability First, Consumer Futures. It is hard to measure the impact that such discussion of preliminary results had on the participants, but from informal feedbacks from participants we think we have given them new insights into ways of thinking about environmental behaviour.

We have organised two one-day workshops to discuss the distribution and dynamics of environmental attitudes and behaviours and their implications for energy demand. Both workshops were held in London. The first one, in December 2013, had speakers from psychology, geography, environmental research, engineering, sociology, economics as well as from DECC (details on the project webpage). The second one, in June 2014 focussed on the results of our project. To both workshops we had participants from academia, Government Departments, the third sector, and from the public. Based on the lively debates with participants at the end of each talk we think the workshops have contributed to give the participants new knowledge about various types of environmental behaviour.

Following the first workshop we were invited to give a seminar at DECC in March 2014 to have a more in-depth discussion of the data and our results. For both DECC and the research team, this discussion has generated a better understanding of data issues in the analysis of environmental behaviour. As a result of this and subsequent discussions, we investigated issues around consent to data linkage to link the DECC National Energy Efficiency Data (NEED) with the UK Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS). The consent question for data linkage will be asked at wave 8 of UKHKLS, which will be piloted in September 2015 with main fieldwork starting in January 2016; the data will become available in few years' time. The linked data will be of enormous value for policy-relevant analysis within DECC and also in other sectors such as energy sector market and consumer research activities and will generate new insights into ways to reduce the carbon footprint of the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7248463A-0238-488B-8D9B-47BFE9C5A7B9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We identified three dimensions of environmental behaviour: at-home, transport-related and purchasing behaviour. People who act in a more pro-environmental way in one dimension do not necessarily do so in another dimensions, and socio-demographic and attitudinal correlates of pro-environmental behaviour also vary between the behavioural dimensions. Policy measures intended to influence behaviour are likely to be more effective for different population subgroups depending on the specific nature of the behavioural change of interest. This has implications both for the marketing and targeting of initiatives and for the nature of the initiatives themselves, as these would ideally be tailored to the characteristics, constraints and motivations of people who tend to behave in particular ways.
There are also constraints to individual pro-environmental behaviour that may derive from the structure of the household the individual belongs to. There may be a life-cycle pattern of pro-environmental behaviour, which is higher for people living alone and for couples without children, but lower for people living in couples with children. Individual pro-environmental behaviour appears to be affected by partner's behaviour and attitudes, and when dealing with pro-environmental choices that pertain to the household level, both partners' behaviours and attitudes seem relevant for household decisions. Effective policies to minimise household's carbon footprint will need to take into account that individuals' decisions and actions depend on constraints generated by the other members of the household. We also find that that the 'climate-gate' had no impact on people's pro-environmental attitudes.
In terms of energy consumption, we find that various household socio-economic characteristics such as household income, the presence of people of pensionable age, jobless, or in poor health have a statistically significant but moderate impact on per-capita energy expenditures. However, dwelling characteristics and especially household size have a much larger impacts in magnitude. Policies designed to improve pro-environmental behaviour of citizens may have a negligible impact given the recent socio-demographic trends, while policies influencing cohabitation and family size may have indirect - possibly large - impacts on the carbon footprint of the country.
Those households who adopt domestic eco-technologies such as solar thermal and photovoltaic are more likely to be home-owners of (large) detached houses in rural areas and have marginally higher reported 'environmentally friendly' views and actions. These are also households with comparatively higher energy expenditures. Urban renters, household living in non-detached houses, those who report lower environmentally friendly views and actions and those who spend less on energy tend to be more likely to either reject (after serious consideration) the possibility of installing eco-technologies or face barriers and constraints to their adoption. Overall, the benefits of incentives to the installation of eco-technologies may accrue to the well off.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of the project have a number of potential uses outside an academic context.
The findings related to drivers of energy consumption are clearly of value in providing insights for energy-demand reduction policy and highlight the need to look beyond information campaigns designed to manipulate social attitudes as these seem to have little relationship with pro-environmental behaviour. In particular two findings are of key relevance:
The importance of joint or dynamnic decision making and constraints in couple and multiu-person or family households where the needs of others need to be accommodated;
The importance of occupancy levels and co-habitation in the per capita (and overall) reduction of energy demand implying a need to consider cross-departmental policies that can mitigate the demographic trend for increased sole-occupancy dwellings. 
The analysis of the factors affecting the uptake of 'energy technology' are of direct relevance to DECC's micro-generation and community energy policies and are also relevant to the installation sector in helping to understand future potential markets and untapped demand.
Finally, the steps that have been taken during the project to demonstrate the critical value of linking reliable energy consumption data with dwelling characteritics and, crucially, a range of behavioural and socio-economic measures of the occupants has lead directly to plans to link UKHLS with DECC's NEED data. This linked data will be of enormous value for policy-relevant analysis within DECC and also, if appropriate data release is possible, in other sectors . These include energy sector market and consumer research activities where robust data of this kind will provide a step change in analytic and demand modelling capability.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A494E3BB-D7AB-4A5D-A8CE-F9EDA5566670</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/ED543576-8154-4740-A933-575F0C71CC18"><gtr:id>ED543576-8154-4740-A933-575F0C71CC18</gtr:id><gtr:title>Residential energy expenditures and the relevance of changes in household circumstances</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Energy Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5a69401a3b7a83514a83d0379085e71c"><gtr:id>5a69401a3b7a83514a83d0379085e71c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Longhi S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C1CB95D7-E96B-499F-B2B2-9CB2204D7916"><gtr:id>C1CB95D7-E96B-499F-B2B2-9CB2204D7916</gtr:id><gtr:title>Individual pro-environmental behaviour in the household context</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e73f8daee70cdb6b0b5f9205623bcce5"><gtr:id>e73f8daee70cdb6b0b5f9205623bcce5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Longhi S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2F674E0E-AC1C-413E-92D1-F54600710856"><gtr:id>2F674E0E-AC1C-413E-92D1-F54600710856</gtr:id><gtr:title>Distinguishing dimensions of pro-environmental behaviour</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/38bd8775e3333bf51dcb80bc6822ee5c"><gtr:id>38bd8775e3333bf51dcb80bc6822ee5c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lynn P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A106A965-D80E-4378-A0C7-B29A0B7278C7"><gtr:id>A106A965-D80E-4378-A0C7-B29A0B7278C7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do 'eco' attitudes &amp;amp; behaviours explain the uptake of micro-generation technologies in the UK?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/25f318ac46d1ef5a2a2ac697383433b8"><gtr:id>25f318ac46d1ef5a2a2ac697383433b8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Anderson B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FBC27B65-D6AB-4A78-A090-46478C0A9D14"><gtr:id>FBC27B65-D6AB-4A78-A090-46478C0A9D14</gtr:id><gtr:title>Residential energy use and the relevance of changes in household circumstances</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5a69401a3b7a83514a83d0379085e71c"><gtr:id>5a69401a3b7a83514a83d0379085e71c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Longhi S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K002988/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
