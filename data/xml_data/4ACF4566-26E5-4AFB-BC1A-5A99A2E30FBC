Initiative</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M015211/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) offer extremely useful functional material properties via their strength, electrical and thermal conductivities, and could revolutionize a number of applications - if they could only be produced in large quantities with bulk properties comparable to individual CNTs. The mass production of CNT materials requires trade-offs between throughput, functionality, cost and ease of assembly, which have yet to be optimised. The Advanced Nanotube and Manufacturing (ANAM) Initiative brings together a world-leading group of material scientists, manufacturing and application engineers to effect the scaled up production of functionalized CNTs by developing fundamental insights and new approaches to manufacture CNT materials. This Initiative will provide pathways to large scale CNT production which can be directly deployed in the UK industrial sector.

The overall aims of the ANAM Initiative are to
1. Increase CNT film, fibre and mat production capacity in order to supply commercial quantities;
2. Advance the functionality of mass-produced CNT materials; and
3. Develop prototypes using CNT-based advanced functional materials to serve UK industrial needs.

The research covered by this Initiative will be conducted as an integrated effort between target industries and the academic investigators, focused on the mass production of CNT materials tailored to emerging industrial applications in the UK. The Initiative will simultaneously bolster our scientific understanding of CNT reactors, including complex fluid, particle, chemistry, molecular and thermal dynamics, while providing a pilot system for development of in-situ analysis techniques applicable to a variety of nanomaterial reactor systems. 

Initiative research will be organized into themes focusing on high throughput, advanced functionality and material applications. The high throughput theme will investigate methods of achieving increased production with focused efforts on scaling CNT hot-wall reactors to high-Reynolds number flow, as well as innovative new approaches via atmospheric plasma CNT systems. The advanced functionality theme will develop novel methods of imparting the functional behaviour required by specific end-users. Initial efforts will seek to maximize inherent CNT anisotropic electrical and thermal conduction, specific strength and catalytically activated surface area phenomena. Advances in the physical and chemical nature of CNTs will be engineered by alignment of CNTs via charge-mediated gas-phase self-assembly procedures (physical), and new in-situ CVD coating processes (chemical). Industrial consortium input will lead the material applications theme in proposing CNT functional material projects, such as light-weight, electrical conductors for motors and high-surface area, high-activity catalysts. Material requirements identified in the materials applications projects will serve as constraints to the optimization work within the high throughput and advanced functionality themes, focusing the plethora of possible directions to those of use to UK industry. 

The ANAM Initiative's impact will serve to enhance the capabilities of UK industry in incorporating CNT materials within end-use products to achieve novel advanced functionality. Dissemination of findings will occur at bi-annual consortium meetings and a monthly seminar series. All intellectual property will be offered to the consortium members, while publication rights will be maintained by the academic institutions. The generated knowledge will translate research outcomes to world-leading UK produced high-value goods.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ANAM Initiative is structured to deliver high-impact research that adds value to UK industry manufacturing and product development. The consortium of industrial partners, steering and focusing the research, is the essence of the project. The consortium contains a mix of CNT production and end-use CNT applications companies. The connection to CNT production allows manufacturing advances realised by the research to be quickly and smoothly transferred into industrial scale manufacturing techniques and knowledge which, in turn, will create a centre of CNT manufacturing excellence within the UK. The aim of this Initiative is to develop the UK's CNT technology capability such that the UK becomes the undisputed global leader in CNT applications.

End-user industrial partners, representing a variety of sectors such as aerospace, automotive and consumer appliances, will be able to select and create projects designed to enhance their current product offerings through incorporation of functional CNT materials. By tailoring the research to the real needs of industry, the potential economic impact of the research will be greatly increased and the time taken to bring the technology to market reduced. In constructing prototypes specific to each of these diverse industrial partners, the Initiative will create credible proof of concept demonstrators in a multiplicity of sectors.

Customising the research to industrial requirements will be a continuous process. With bi-annual meetings, the industrial partners will participate in the shaping of the research agenda, and be privy to the latest findings relevant to CNT synthesis and applications across a range of industries. The collaboration across industrial sectors will provide a unique opportunity for industrial researchers and academics to connect innovations in diverse applications.

The Initiative will hold a roadmapping session at the project outset to ensure that the research criteria reflect the long term needs of the industry while accounting for recent developments. The exercise will allow the Initiative to plan its technological capabilities in concert with consortium's commercial and strategic goals. 

As well as the obvious impacts for the producers and manufacturers, there are multiple opportunities for the Initiative's research to have significant wider benefits for society and for the UK economy. The research areas currently anticipated would see great economic and societal benefits; for example, replacing heavy copper films with cheaper and lighter CNT-based films within an aerospace application would not only have the immediately obvious manufacturing cost benefits, but also the fiscal, health and environmental benefits of reduced fuel usage, when used in automotive, would not only see cost savings, but also improve the reliability and safety of vehicles.

By founding the ANAM Initiative on an industrial consortium, impact has been given primary importance within the project. The societal and economic benefits will be significant; not only will the industrial partners gain from the world-leading technology, generating profits and employment, but in creating a global centre of excellence in the field of CNT applications, the Initiative will attract new R&amp;amp;D investment to the UK. The potential spin-offs of this research could see major new industrial sectors form and thrive within the UK economy, creating significant additional, non-financial benefits for the UK population, for example, improving health and well-being of the population or reducing the environmental impact of technologies. The Initiative will continue to find methods and avenues to enhance and increase the impact of its research to benefit the UK economy, society and environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2811852</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>BAE Systems</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>BAE Industrial Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>0CCCA1C0-B179-4644-A321-3EC6289C828A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is in an early stage.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>A representative from BAE Systems has attended WebEx and face-to face meeting, at their own cost, to review the project. they have been forthcoming in providing information on their industrial applications for which the CNT fibre would be best suited and for which the specific advantages of CNT materials would be most valuable.

? Have developed a method for the one-step synthesis of luminescent carbon nanoparticles (NPs) via laser irradiation of a graphite target. This is a simple approach for the fabrication of carbon dots with tuneable photoluminescence (PL) that differs from the other preparation methods as no post-passivation step is required.

? Have demonstrated an entirely new method of nanoparticle chemical synthesis based on liquid droplet irradiation with ultralow (&amp;lt;0.1 eV) energy electrons which leads to a number of important and unique benefits. In a proof-of-principle demonstration, small-diameter Au nanoparticles (~4nm) with tight control of polydispersity have been obtained.

Cambridge University- 
? Have analysis of continuous synthesis of 100% CNT material via a floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition (FC-CVD) aerogel method. They have found that the process is not driven by injection conditions, occurs exclusively in reactor exit zone. The process is driven by re-nucleation of catalytic nanoparticles and pyrolysis species. C13 use reveals CNT formation is not influenced by C present in catalyst precursors.

? Extrapolating the properties of individual CNTs into macro-scale CNT materials using a continuous and cost effective process offers enormous potential for a variety of applications. 

? Work has looked at correlating information on decomposition of reactants, axial catalyst nanoparticle dynamics and the morphology of the resultant CNTs and shows how these are strongly related to the temperature and chemical availability within the reactor. For the first time, in-situ measurements of catalyst particle size distributions coupled with reactant decomposition profiles and a detailed axial SEM study of formed CNT materials reveal specific domains that have important implications for scale-up. A novel observation is the formation, disappearance and reformation of catalyst nanoparticles along the reactor axis, caused by their evaporation and re-condensation and mapping of different CNT morphologies as a result of this process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings will be used in the scaling of the process.

In this way, the plasma system is a good candidate for scaled-up CNT production because a high throughput can be achieved with a small volume. Moreover, the temperature of the plasma is in the range of 5000 to 10000&amp;deg;C, and as a result, cheap, readily available powdered reagents can be used which would not normally vaporize at the temperatures achieved by a tube furnace.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Continuous Production of Carbon Nanotubes with Microwave Plasma</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The conventional transient thermal conductivity measurements typically involve relatively complicated data analysis and are contingent upon the accurate determination of specific heat capacity and density, which could be very difficult for novel nano-materials. On the other hand, the common steady state thermal conductivity measurements rely on the fact that the length of the heat flow is short and the cross section is large. So only adapt to thin thermal insulators. Then the convection and the thermal radiation can be neglect. However, this assumption may bring in vital deviation, because the relative high thermal conductivity and the large radio of surface area to the volume. 

Here we developed a dual mode thermal conductivity measurement method, in which high vacuum condition are introduced so that the convection influence could be mostly eliminated. At the same time, the temperature profiles of reference sample and tested specimen are detected using an infrared camera. Thanks to this modification, the temperature on the sample would not be affected by the relatively large heat capacity of the thermocouples.
