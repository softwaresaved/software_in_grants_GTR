Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M027007/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project consists of a two year programme which aims to bridge the gap between Engineering, Natural Sciences and Physical Sciences and AMR Research. The purpose of the programme is to try and engage these disciplines in multidisciplinary research which is important and relevant in tackling the catastrophic threat that antimicrobial resistance poses. The programme is principally designed to develop a cohort of interdisciplinary research fellows who through the programme, will develop a unique set of hybrid research skills, a positive attitude to multidisciplinary research and the ability to communicate across traditional academic boundaries. We aim that these individuals will become the potential future leaders in multidisciplinary research into AMR. Supporting this main aim, are a range of activities designed to bridge the gaps between disciplines, encourage researchers in different disciplines to engage in collaborative AMR research while also providing valuable learning experiences for the fellows. Activities include developing a virtual network for AMR research, organising conferences and seminars, a sandpit exercise and supporting pump-primed AMR projects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of this programme of research is to deliver a cohort of multidisciplinary researchers in AMR with the potential to become leaders in cross-discipline working. The aim of this capacity building and the associated activities are to stimulate research into AMR. The societal and economic costs of AMR are difficult to quantify, they include the health and economic burdens for the individual, their dependants, employers, businesses and the wider economy. In 2009, it was estimated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) that AMR costed the EU about 1.5 billion Euro in healthcare expenses and lost productivity each year. 

Reductions in treatment failure through improved diagnostics, technologies to support more appropriate prescribing or better clinical management facilitated through improved surveillance and data-linkage would reduce the instances of AMR and its associated costs. It is possible that such advances may result in the future from our initial-stage development of discipline-spanning fellows, equipped to tackle the challenges of AMR in a multifaceted, integrated way.

The small pump-priming projects which will be funded as part of the programme may also have a more immediate impact on AMR. It is our ambition that as many of these as possible should be translational - i.e based on real problems at the diagnostic bench or the patient bedside, with a clear aim of ultimately bringing some practical benefit to the NHS or other agencies with a role to play in addressing AMR. The beneficiaries of such work should therefore be clinicians, other healthcare workers and policy makers and through them, the general public under their care. It is hoped that the partnerships made available through the HPRU will greatly facilitate the translation of any relevant innovation or findings, into our local NHS or into policy formulation at the PHE with some resulting impact on clinical care

In addition to the economic benefits which would accrue from a reduction in AMR on any level, there is also potential economic benefit should any of the research conducted as part of the pump-priming projects or any research conducted as a result of grant applications submitted by partnerships established through this initiative, be developed into a marketable product. Imperial College has a well-established technology transfer arm and Professor Toumazou has an existing portfolio of spin-out companies which hold over 50 patents and employ over 350 people. It is therefore possible that research resulting from this initiative may also see academia operating as an engine for economic growth among SMEs if they led to the development of start up companies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>749583</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In the 5th annual Imperial festival EMBRACE ran the &amp;quot;Infection Investigator&amp;quot; in the Superbug Zone.

Identifying the correct combinations completed electrical circuits to power light bulbs or motors, providing visual real-time feedback on their decisions. The game focused on three different pathogens responsible for many common infections (viruses, bacteria and fungi); fun facts and information on the differences between these microorganisms were also provided. The design proved to be extremely popular, especially for families, with around 200 participants over the weekend.

The game was designed to represent how the three Faculties (Medicine, Engineering and Natural Sciences) involved in the EMBRACE program can combine to tackle problems associated with Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). 

This event successfully provided learning experiences for the Bridging The Gap fellows through cross-disciplinary interaction. This event gave our fellows a wider audience outside their discipline/department, it was a unique opportunity to break down barriers and encourage engagement from the students and general public, bringing visibility to the research being done in AMR at the Imperial College.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>&quot;Infection Investigator&quot; game to show multidisciplinary approach to AMR</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Real-time Enhanced Antimicrobial ConTroller (REACT)</gtr:description><gtr:id>8F848008-62B8-4155-9727-075BF0B8008E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary project from: Medicine, Electronic Engineering, Bioengineering, and Chemistry.

With this partner EMBRACE guarantees a premium venue to showcase the work being done though the grant but also its engagement with other partners and its willingness to be a multidisciplinary project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Summit will be held at the Royal Institution's historic home in Mayfair, London on 26 September 2017. For over 200 years, the Royal Institution has been the place where cutting edge science has been announced, discussed and disseminated, by both experts and the curious public. It's no surprise that the father of antibiotics, Alexander Fleming, gave a presentation to the Royal Institution on 27 November 1953.
The Summit will feature two panel discussions featuring some of the foremost thinkers who are tackling the global challenge of infectious diseases. Between sessions there will be time to chat to researchers who will be presenting their latest findings.
Following the afternoon presentations, the evening will be given over to a keynote address, given by a world renowned figure. The evening will be hosted by Sir Richard Sykes, Chair of the Royal Institution and former Rector of Imperial College.

The R.I. is also keen in contributing to one of the main objectives of EMBRACE which is to create role models and career paths for future researchers. With this in mind, they want to coordinate an 'Unconference' event for students 16-18 years on the topic of AMR, this would be on a separate day in the lead up to or after the Conference.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The second EMBRACE conference is planned to take place on 26th Sept 2017, at the Royal Institution. As with all EMBRACE activities, our conference is designed to build multidisciplinary research capacity to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The conference will be focused on AMR to a scientific audience but also to the public in general. 

One of the main goals will also be to connect with institutions across the UK and internationally, giving EMBRACE the opportunity to establish more contacts for future applications
The activities that run through the day will show the work being done by our Bridging the Gaps fellows in the field of AMR, since the start of the grant and our cross-disciplinary interaction in the pump priming projects currently underway. This will be a way to showcase the projects' research and establish contacts for future collaborations.

With the purpose of increasing involvement of other disciplines, there will be opportunity to include the social sciences in a way to understand what the public want to know about AMR and behavior change.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collect clinical isolates of microorganisms</gtr:description><gtr:id>8433CA21-A2B3-4B92-9075-DF901E8C4BC9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multidisciplinary team led by Professor Takats and his research group who have extensive experience in analytical chemistry, the development of mass spectrometry based diagnostic technologies, clinical microbiology and molecular based methods including sequencing and PCR.

The partnership between EMBRACE and HPRU is also enabling the development of a unique set of hybrid research skills from our Bridging the Gaps Fellows, a positive attitude to multidisciplinary research and the ability to communicate across traditional academic boundaries.
This award is providing a impetus for greater engagement from researchers in Engineering and the Physical and Natural Sciences fields with the AMR agenda, due to the funding of five multidisciplinary pump priming projects and an extremely successful sandpit project which has already led to a successful application for external funding.
We anticipate this leading to explorations of new approaches, novel applications and entirely new directions of research relevant to addressing AMR and an increase in the number of submitted and funded multidisciplinary AMR research projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Unit with its multidisciplinary programme has outstanding expertise in HCAI and AMR and access to resources including biobanks, local and national linked data and patient populations, all of which offer outstanding research opportunities currently being exploited by five pump priming projects and a sandpit project funded by EMBRACE.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The EMBRACE programme is providing organisational learning about the most appropriate ways to support and encourage interdisciplinary working. The adopted model of capacity building through the appointment of our Bridging the Gaps Fellows is stimulating cross-discipline working and providing a focal point for developing collaborations and at the same time creating learning experiences for the Bridging The Gap fellows. Another important contribution to this partnership from EMBRACE is the offering of pump priming funding. This has created more opportunities for cross-disciplinary interaction and allowed for projects outcomes which are relevant to AMR, providing pilot data for larger applications.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London (ICL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ARC@Imperial</gtr:description><gtr:id>2FDEF588-EA7C-470A-9A76-FEDDA137A75B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is enabling the exploration of new approaches, novel applications and entirely new directions of research relevant to addressing the AMR problem.

The conference brought together a host of world-leading researchers in the fields of antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases, as well as representatives from government, industry and funding bodies. The conference attendees were also given the opportunity to visit the Data Science Institute's observatory, where Dr Ceire Costelloe demonstrated visualisations of antibiotic prescriptions and patterns of disease in the UK. 

The first session of the conference centred on updates from ARC's research fellows and ended with a keynote lecture delivered by Dr Mark Holmes (University of Cambridge Veterinary School), and focused on how the natural history of AMR genes can be examined in the animal host through the use of chromosome conformation metagenomics. The second session looked at data linkage and data visualisation for research and policy follwed by a third session focused on identifying targets in AMR. The fourth session of the day was centred on understanding the emergence of resistance and the fifth and final session included discussions on innovation in technology for diagnosis and dosing.

The conference concluded with a topical panel discussion. The panel members included Professor John Watson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for the Department of Health, keynote speaker Dr Mark Holmes, Ghada Zoubiane of the MRC, and industry representatives Hideki Maki, Shionogi, and Helen Steel, GSK. The panel discussed the impact of Brexit on AMR research, with all agreeing that collaboration would still be essential to future progress in the field.

Professor John Watson underlined the necessity of considering how resource-poor countries can be allowed full access to antibiotics, without causing problems of excess. In his closing remarks Professor John Watson stated &amp;quot;one country alone clearly cannot deal with this problem [of AMR]&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/medicine/departmentofmedicine/newssummary/news_28-9-2016-10-45-49</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar on &quot;Antibiotics in the environment, implications for Antibiotic-Resistance&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCD45208-F0CE-4CE4-AF91-07484633D06D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A great presentation by Dr Nick Voulvoulis, an expert in Environmental Technology allowed our audience to see a different approach to the AMR problematic and also engage with experts from another discipline.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Double Seminar on &quot;Using whole genome sequencing to investigate the national and international spread of multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae lineages&quot;  and &quot;Using whole genome sequencing to investigate healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance&quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F00D64C7-50B0-458A-BC4F-9CCB61F3F32E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The first EMBRACE double seminar brought together Dr Nickolas Croucher, Faculty of Medicine, School of Public Health and Dr Elita Jauneikaite, Elita Jauneikaite, Research Associate at the NIHR.

Over 30 investigators from Imperial College and Universities of Newcastle, Surrey and Warwick gathered at South Kensington. The four EMBRACE co-PI's, Professors Chris Toumazou (Engineering), Alison Holmes (Medicine), Alan Armstrong (Natural Science) and Pantelis Georgiou (Engineering) were responsible for stimulating and provoking the participants with short talks and sharp questions. The three EMBRACE fellows, Doctors Lindsay Evans (Natural Science), Maryam Modarai (Medicine) and Pau Herrero (Engineering), were among the participants. 

During the first day, several activities involving a lot of creative methods and soapbox talks were conducted in order to get to know each other and get a better picture of the expertise in the room. Lewis Preece from EPSRC gave a talk on the longer term funding opportunities that are on offer, and which could be used to obtain follow-up funding after the sandpit. The day ended with a dinner at 58 Prince's Gate.
The second day of the sandpit was focused on creating multidisciplinary teams of 4-8 participants and writing short, innovative proposals tackling the problem of AMR. At the end of the day, 5 proposals were presented which were evaluated by a panel of experts formed by Professors Alison Holmes, Alan Armstrong, Pantelis Georgiou and Ramesh Wigneshweraraj.

The requirement for projects to be interdisciplinary and with new collaborations has led to people working together that would not have otherwise. Expectations are that through this pump-priming project the development of collaborations and outcomes will provide track record/pilot data for larger applications. Already some ideas are being translated in potential calls together with HPRU for funding from EPSRC/NIHR.

Through lectures, interactive group work and laboratory research projects they covered topics as diverse and wide-ranging as stress to big data. On the penultimate day of the school, the EMBRACE team joined forces with Dr Mariam Sbaiti from the School of Public Health to deliver a day on Antimicrobial Resistance &amp;amp; Global Health.

The day commenced with an introduction to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from Dr Maryam Modarai (EMBRACE fellow, department of Medicine). This charted the discovery and widespread implementation of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections (a true revolution in biomedicine!), the emergence of resistance infection and the mechanisms by which they arise, and the potential post-antibiotic era that we face today. This was followed by two research talks from Imperial's Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborative (ARC) fellows, Dr Martina Valentini and Dr Myrsini Kaforou. Both talks focused on specific areas of research within the field of AMR that are currently being undertaken at Imperial College, introducing the students to current research topics and giving insight into the world of biomedical research.

The students had opportunity to ask questions about AMR in the broader context and promoted discussions between the panel and students. Important topics such as the economic reasons behind the lack of new antibiotics coming to market in the last 30 years, the effects of unregulated antibiotic use, and why bacteriophages, which are a popular alternative to antibiotics in countries such as Russia, are not used worldwide were discussed.

The day was highly successful in fulfilling its aims of engaging the next generation of scientists and medics on the threat of AMR and the complex problems that feed into global health issues. The students particularly enjoyed hearing about the cutting-edge research at Imperial College and the opportunity for discussion with people working in these important research areas.

The game was designed to represent how the three Faculties (Medicine, Engineering and Natural Sciences) involved in the EMBRACE program can combine to tackle problems associated with Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). It successfully provided learning experiences for the Bridging The Gap fellows through cross-disciplinary interaction.

As with all EMBRACE activities, our conference was designed to build multidisciplinary research capacity to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to delve into the multi-faceted nature of the antimicrobial resistance problem which requires collaborative innovation on new diagnostics, improved surveillance, effective behaviour change and improved education. Also noted was the importance of translational and interdisciplinary research in this context, and Imperial's tradition of innovative research in this area. The conference included sessions on Data, Diagnostics and the Molecular Perspective, plus a panel discussion and poster competition.
Providing a meeting point for engagement with other researchers, breaking down barriers and increasing the profile of AMR research outside the Medicine and Life sciences departments. With this in mind, the winners of the first pump-priming competition where also announced and a presentation of their projects was made.
The event was also used to advertise the Bi-monthly seminar series which include speakers from other institutions and researchers from wide range of disciplines. 

In order to build up momentum and create more opportunities for cross-disciplinary interaction, our sandpit event was also advertised. The aim was to get more participants for the event in July in order to develop a large scale research proposal. 

The conference gave researchers from Imperial and beyond the opportunity to see some of the innovative AMR research underway, and, just as importantly, enabled investigators and other researchers across the College to embark on new areas of multi-disciplinary work through the contacts that where made but also created opportunities for established groups to work towards developing larger funding proposals. 

Over 130 delegates speakers from Imperial College, EPSRC, Corporate (DNAe Eletronics, Alere Limited, Shionogi Limited) The Francis Crick Institute, Universitie of Singapore/Southampton/Shionogi/Kings College. 
Students from Francis Crick Institute, Kings College London, University of Southampton, Sheffield, Warwick, Manchester, Nottingham, Surrey, Public Health England, London School Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and London Metropolitan University. Researchers, consultants, managers and pharmacists from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and National Physical Laboratory KEYNOTE on Technology for the control of antimicrobial resistance from SE Asia by Professor Paul Ananth Tambyah a Professor of Medicine at the National University of Singapore and Senior Consultant Infectious Diseases Physician at the National University Hospital, Singapore. 
Imperial presenters included Dr Gerald Larrouy-Maumus, Prof Yi-Ke Guo, Prof Ed Tate and Dr C&amp;eacute;ire Costelloe. Also presenting where Prof Douglas Young of the Crick Institute and Sam Reed from DNAe Electronics. The EMBRACE PI and CoIs chaired the sessions on Data, Diagnostics and the Molecular Perspective

Session 1 on Diagnostics and Session 3 on Molecular Perspective had presentations of the pump-priming award winners. 

The final session was Chaired by Professor Neil Alford, Vice Dean of Research, Faculty of Engineering, Imperial College and the panellists where Professor Paul Ananth Tambyah, University of Singapore, Professor Tim Leighton, University of Southampton, Dr Kai Stoeber, Shionogi Ltd, Sam Reed, DNAe Electronics, Professor Alison Holmes, Imperial College and Dr Pantelis Georgiou, Imperial College.

The event was oversubscribed and gave researchers from Imperial and beyond the opportunity to see some of the innovative AMR research underway and the opportunity to identify potential research collaborators. This conference also enabled investigators and other researchers across the College to embark on new areas of multi-disciplinary work through the contacts that where made but also created opportunities for established groups to work towards developing larger funding proposals.

This event was aimed at increasing the profile of AMR research through Imperial College engaging with researchers from other disciplines, but also establishing contacts with institutions across the UK, giving the EMBRACE team a wider audience outside their discipline/department. The activities that run through the day showed the work being done by our Bridging the Gaps fellows in the field of AMR, their cross-disciplinary interaction in the pump priming awards but also the role models and career paths EMBRACE created for junior researchers with an interest in multidisciplinary research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.imperial.ac.uk/arc/embrace/conferences/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>World Antibiotic Awareness Week and EMBRACE</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2365287-492C-40C1-A827-D229F685D83E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 18th November 2016, EMBRACE organised its first joint seminar with SurreyCHAIR, associating the event with the World Antibiotic Awareness Week, raising awareness as well as funds with the Great British Tea Party. 

The guest reader was Professor Alasdair &amp;quot;Alex&amp;quot; Cook who is a veterinary epidemiologist with more than 25 years national and international experience in livestock animal health in Government, academic and development environments. Alex is a firm believer in a multi-disciplinary team approach to research, engaging with molecular biologists, microbiologists and socio-economists to name but a few. This idea brought both groups together and further collaboration is planned with a joint data visualisation workshop as well as a series of seminars/workshops on drug detection technology and devices; longitudinal study on education and AMR stewardship and economics and prescribing.

Our second reader of the day was Dr Caroline Colijn on &amp;quot;Bacterial Olympics: Competition and resistance&amp;quot;. She works with a broad aim to develop the mathematical tools to connect sequence data for pathogens to pathogen ecology. Caroline also has a long-standing interest on the dynamics of diverse interacting pathogens. Her group is building new approaches to analysing phylogenetic trees derived from pathogen sequence data, studying tree space and branching processes, and doing ecological and epidemiological modelling. 

After the presentations the attendees stayed for our charity bake sale and coffee morning, part of the Great British Tea Partyorganised to help Antibiotic Research UK to raise valuable funds for research, education and patient support. We raised over &amp;pound;120 and sold delicious cakes made for the event by members of our team.

The morning was highly successful in fulfilling our aims of raising awareness and funds to the World Antibiotic Awareness Week and also engaging with researchers from Surrey School of Veterinary Medicine, following an earlier meeting in July.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/medicine/arc/newssummary/news_30-11-2016-12-22-16</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>M&amp;eacute;rieux Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Merieux Institute (Institut M?rieux)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2A9B83CD-8C9F-4276-80E8-623FF971BCF9</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>209169</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Global Challanges Research Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>003F480E-F689-4C5D-A783-CE3D2BAC8EF6</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1469490</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme (EME) Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1B4D5D42-50FE-4F32-B337-3A5625B28918</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>125000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Wellcome Trust Pathfinder award for &amp;quot;Selective targeting of drug-resistant pathogens without affecting the microbiota&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Wellcome Trust Ltd</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>EB7A1ECB-4112-4A43-A361-8691F2064ADF</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>70000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC DTP grant - PHD Studentship Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>8D8D5CC2-DE40-4DB8-9B47-0F1E09D83C4E</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This award is a bridging the gaps fund aimed at facilitating cross-disciplinary collaboration and research in Antimicrobial resistance. As part of this award we have:

1. Conducted a first pump priming call on January 2016, where we awarded two pump-priming grants (&amp;pound;10K each) to cross-faculty teams who took part in our pump-priming competition, and which received 6 entries. The successful projects involve new collaborations between researchers from at least two of our three science faculties. The conditions for the awards include the development of consequent full research proposals and the further interdisciplinary development of the EMBRACE Fellows, as well as demonstrating creativity. First project: 'Targeting quadruplex-DNA in the promoters of genes associated to antimicrobial resistance' (AMR). This is a collaboration between Faculties of Medicine and Natural Science at Imperial College London + Institute of Pharmacy at Kings College London. Second project: 'Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry for the Early Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance'. This is a collaboration between all three science faculties: Engineering, Natural Science and Medicine.

2. Conducted a second pump priming call on September 2016, where we awarded three pump-priming grants (&amp;pound;10K each) to cross-faculty teams who took part in our pump-priming competition, and which received 11 entries. The successful projects involve new collaborations between researchers from at least two of our three science faculties. The conditions for the awards include the development of consequent full research proposals, further interdisciplinary development of the EMBRACE Fellows, as well as demonstrating creativity and new consortium formation.

Third project: Real-time Enhanced Antimicrobial ConTroller (REACT). This is a collaboration between all three science faculties: Engineering, Natural Science and Medicine.

3. Conducted a Sandpit event on July 2016 which awarded one grant (&amp;pound;15K) to the following project: &amp;quot;Promoting Immune Clearance of Bacterial Pathogens&amp;quot;. This award is a multidisciplinary collaboration from all three science faculties: Engineering, Natural Science and Medicine. This was a result of a two-day event with over 30 investigators from Imperial College and Universities of Newcastle, Surrey and Warwick gathered at the South Kensington Campus to participate in our first EPSRC supported EMBRACE Sandpit to propose innovative solutions to address the challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).

4. Run our first conference entitled Multidisciplinary Approaches to Tackling AMR, 9th March 2016. This was heavily oversubscribed - 137 delegates registered for 100 places. This engaged researchers across Imperial, industry representatives and researchers from other institutions including other ERSRC Bridging the Gaps projects. The conference was opened by the President of IC and closed by the Provost. We have tracked new associations arising from the conference participation within days of the event (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/arc/embrace/conference-9-march-2016/). Currently we are also working on the &amp;quot;Technology vs Infectious Diseases: An Imperial College / Royal Institution Summit&amp;quot;. The Summit will be held at the Royal Institution's historic home in Mayfair, London on 26 September 2017. The Summit will feature two panel discussions featuring some of the foremost thinkers who are tackling the global challenge of infectious diseases. Between sessions there will be time to chat to researchers who will be presenting their latest findings. Following the afternoon presentations, the evening will be given over to a keynote address, given by a world-renowned figure. The evening will be hosted by Sir Richard Sykes, Chair of the Royal Institution and former Rector of Imperial College.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Outcomes so far include:
1. We have hired 3 cross-disciplinary fellows, one in Engineering, one in Chemistry and one in Medicine and the events scheduled in this award are facilitating their development towards independent research careers and applying for EPSRC fellowships. Our fellows are becoming increasingly active in the emergent network of EPSRC Bridging the Gaps projects. 
2. We have awarded five pump priming awards and a sandpit award to generate crossdisciplinary-collaboration within the Faculties of Imperial for new research in AMR. The outputs of these will be pilot date for larger collaborative grants in AMR.
3. We have run our first of two conferences which has enable cross-disciplinary networking within the field of AMR and formation of new collaborations.
4. Successfully engaging the Royal Institution to organise a summit on AMR. This event will be a great showcase for the research being done at Imperial College London and will increase the profile of AMR and multidisciplinary research.
