Understanding these processes is of fundamental and practical importance - for example, planning conservation strategies increasingly uses information on evolutionary relationships as part of prioritising decisions about individual species. However, for tropical plants communities, sufficiently large datasets based on DNA sequences are only just beginning to reveal the evolutionary relationships between species. As a result, the implications of threats, either through land-use or climate change, for the conservation of the evolutionary history of these communities remains almost entirely unknown. 

Our research will take advantage of impressive existing data of tree inventories, covering more than 1000 sites in three major biomes in tropical South America: rain forests, dry forests and savannas. We will link these data with new information on the evolutionary relationships of all genera, and all species of the legume family, which is dominant in all three biomes, using DNA sequence data. A genus-level evolutionary tree will allow us to make analyses deep into evolutionary time, whereas a species-level legume tree will give a view of recent evolution. We will investigate how many times lineages of trees have switched between the different biomes, which will deliver important knowledge for conservation and future studies of evolutionary diversification. If lineages have rarely switched between biomes, then each biome will contain a distinct subset of evolutionary diversity, and destruction of a single biome could wipe out an entire part of evolutionary history.

Such scenarios of the destruction of an entire biome are not unlikely. One important aspect of this proposal is that it will not focus solely on the rain forests of the Amazon Basin, but will also consider the forgotten biomes of tree-dominated savannas and tropical dry forests. These formations deserve greater attention from scientists and conservationists because they are species-rich, and have suffered greater destruction - more than 70% of the original two million km2 of the Brazilian savannas have been destroyed, whereas c. 70% of Amazonia is intact. Tropical dry forests, of which less than 5% remain in many areas, are the most threatened tropical forest type in the world. We believe our research will highlight the importance and plight of tropical dry forests and savannas, characterised by many decision makers and commentators as worthless - fair game for destruction if this might save rain forest areas - exemplified by a recent leader in the Economist magazine (28.08.2010; Brazil's agricultural miracle: Plant the plains, save the forests; http://www.economist.com/node/16889019).

In addition to biome switching, we will also investigate how adaptations to specific climatic and soil conditions have changed during evolution in these groups. This work will enable us to understand the processes driving the biome shifts we observe. In addition, these analyses may help to understand how climate change will affect communities: for example, if changes in climatic preferences of species have occurred infrequently related species will tend to have similar climatic niches, and whole groups of related species might be vulnerable to extinction from particular trajectories of climate change.

The final stage of our study will examine the implications for loss of evolutionary diversity in different biomes under projected scenarios of climate and land-use change. Our results will be of relevance to conservation planning by national government agencies in South America and international organisations, such as the WWF, involved in setting priorities for tropical conservation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

National government agencies (e.g., Ministerio del Ambiente and Ministerio de Agricultura, Peru), national NGOs (e.g., Fundacion Amigos de la Naturaleza - FAN (Bolivia), Amazon Conservation Association - ACA (Peru)) and international organisations (e.g., Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Conservation International) involved in setting priorities for conservation of tropical ecosystems at a variety of scales. 

Members of the general public both in the UK and internationally will benefit from a wider understanding of the diversity of tropical vegetation and the distinct threats faced by different biomes. The base of the project at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh will offer considerable opportunities to reach this wider audience.

Young scientists in Peru and Brazil will benefit from training designed to build capacity in biodiversity science.

How will they benefit from this research?

Our research will be of relevance to international organisations and government agencies involved in conservation in the tropics because the evolutionary diversity in ecosystems is an acknowledged important consideration in times of global change. Our research therefore has the potential to influence the perception of the biological value of different major tropical biomes in South America by providing insight into the distribution of evolutionary diversity between different areas of rain forests, seasonally dry forests and savannas.

If the full spectrum of tropical biodiversity is to be conserved, it is important to shift, in part, public focus from rain forests, and to highlight the particular biodiversity of other biomes such as savannas and tropical dry forests. In South America, savannas such as the Brazilian cerrado and dry forests are far more threatened than the Amazon rain forest, but few people outside the region have even heard of them. Our public outreach will redress this balance and highlight the plight and importance of these forgotten formations.

Young scientists in Peru and Brazil will benefit from capacity-building in biodiversity inventory and laboratory research by participation in field, herbarium and laboratory work. We aim to teach students from these countries skills relevant to biodiversity conservation in the 21st century, including vegetation inventory, taxonomic identification and molecular systematics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>258551</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>49000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Leverhulme Research Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Leverhulme Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D59D8A29-AB43-417F-8744-E463403F1A29</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>CNPq PhD studentships</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>11B24EF5-1112-44DC-8168-1502BEAE66D8</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our work has highlighted the need to develop a better network of quantitative forest inventory plots in Latin American dry biomes to monitor biodiversity, carbon stock, carbon balance, tree growth, and tree mortality beyond rain forests, and into tropical dry forests.

We are addressing this in NERC-CONFAP Brazil Newton Fund grant (NE/N000587/1; 2015-16), which builds directly on our project. This Newton grant is reaching out to Brazilian researchers who have established monitoring plots in dry biomes, with the goal that they may store their data in the ForestPlots.net database hosted by the University of Leeds, and that they may wish to join UK-led forest monitoring efforts in Latin America. It is therefore helping to consolidate the ForestPlots system as a leading global resource for plot data of all the world's tropical forests and is helping to expand the RAINFOR network beyond the Amazon.

Our work has also highlighted that there is much to be gained by closer collaboration in future between ecologists, evolutionary biologists and systematists working in tropical forests via mutual studies in long-term permanent inventory plots and we are working to encourage such interdisciplinary work. This was the theme of a symposium organised by PIs Pennington and Baker in Oxford in 2015, which gathered together taxonomists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists.

Integration of plot and community data from seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF), savanna and rain forest in South America

We have compiled a dataset based upon quantitative inventory data and floristic lists covering 512 sites across SDTF, savanna and rain forest biomes in South America. This includes establishing 9 new 0.5Ha permanent plots in SDTF across Peru. Our fieldwiork across Peru, Bolivia and Brazil has generated 2,603 herbarium vouchers with associated silica-gel dried leaf samples for DNA extraction, mostly of the legume family (Leguminosae), which is the focus of our evolutionary research. By collaboration with our extensive network of project partners we accumulated a total of 5,023 silica-gel dried leaf samples that will be archived in the RBGE collection. We have synthesised taxonomic determinations across our plot database with focus on legumes. Part of this taxonomic standardisation has included re-design of the ForestPlots.net database to incorporate photos of herbarium vouchers and more extensive taxonomic information.

2. Quantification of climatic and edaphic niches

Quantification of climatic niches for all our sites is relatively straightforward using remote-sensed and interpolation-based data layers. What has been lacking is data for key soil variables, especially in non-rain forest biomes, which may hold the key to understanding the control of floristic composition. During fieldwork we collected 204 soil samples from inventory sites in diverse biomes, which have been analysed for total P, N, exchangeable Al, K, Mg, Ca. We have also organised unpublished data held at RBGE for 127 savanna sites in Brazil. In total, including RAINFOR sites for which soil data were already available, we have quantitiative soil data to enable analyses of the evolution of edaphic niches for 506 sites .

3. Reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships of angiosperm genera and legume species

We have generated a phylogeny based upon chloroplast matK and rbcL DNA sequences that covers 1121 of 1235 tree genera found in our plot database. This angiosperm-wide phylogeny has been dated using fossil constraints and has already been used in our study of phylogenetic diversity across the Amazon (Honorio et al., 2015). We have DNA sequence data from our own new sequences and from genbank for 931 of 1452 legume tree species found in our plots, which are being used to construct our legume phylogeny. Our new sequence data are being used by the Legume Phylogeny Working Group to generate the most comprehensive legume phylogeny to date.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work has highlighted the need to develop a better network of quantitative forest inventory plots in Latin American dry biomes to monitor biodiversity, carbon stock, carbon balance, tree growth, and tree mortality beyond rain forests, and into tropical dry forests.
