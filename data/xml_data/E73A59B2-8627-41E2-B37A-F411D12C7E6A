It will be hosted and lead by the University of Manchester involving university researchers and industry. The programme will build on the deep history and track record of research excellence and expertise at Manchester on the geology and characterisation of UK Carboniferous petroleum systems and associated shale resources. NERC sponsorship has been a core part of the research programmes at the University. This platform of knowledge forms the basis for a new and focussed programme of collaboration, learning and research that has the potential to enable a step forward in knowledge and capability in the assessment of resource potential and development of UK Carboniferous shale resources. 

The recent government sponsored report from BGS suggests that there is potential for considerable shale gas resources in the UK Carboniferous, specifically in the Bowland and Hodder Shales of northern England. The assessment was based upon the analysis of legacy cores and data together with a limited number of recent core and geochemical data. There is no production data to model and predict likely recoveries of these potential resources. Critical subsurface uncertainties relate to the understanding of what might be considered recoverable shale gas resource and the controls on the distribution of lower risk areas for development. There is also important learning required in new well delivery to enable safe drilling and completion planning and execution. 
 
The aim of CASCADE is to develop deeper links between University of Manchester researchers and industry working on UK shale operations and related exploration and development. Significant NERC-funded research on shale petroleum systems and potential shale reservoirs has been undertaken at the University of Manchester. Much of this has direct bearing on the UK's Carboniferous unconventional resource and reservoir characterisation, its production and environmental impact as well as potentially wider impact on global unconventional gas and oil exploitation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74789</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>One of the key outcomes of CASCADE was a website which contains information about the various projects which were ongoing (initially those which were presented, based in the host universities and institutions, with a view to expand this to include research projects at other universities working within the area of geology of UK Carboniferous mudstone).

It was also discussed as to whether there were other potential resources which could be uploaded to the CASCADE website to benefit both researchers and industry. This included: published material (data and literature) to be accessible in a format which is easy to integrate and understand; a bibliography of relevant literature which is published on (but not limited to) the Carboniferous mudstones of the UK being easily accessible in a reference list style with open access articles available as downloads; UK outcrop locations (including those containing known marine bands).
Feedback from all who attended was very positive, with an interest in a CASCADE 2 event in 2017 to showcase potentially new NERC-funded CASCADE researchers and updates on the research presented at this inaugural CASCADE core workshop.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>168E8B83-4B33-4C7F-AFA6-961B2D665579</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was an impact development award. Researchers at University of Manchester, University of Leicester and British Geological Survey (BGS) hosted a core based workshop at the BGS core store in Keyworth, Nottingham on the 21st January 2016. The intention of the workshop was to combine researchers from the three host institutions as well as researchers from other Universities and geoscientists working within industry to provide an active discussion session based around current research into Carboniferous mudstones within the UK. This free workshop attracted 30 attendees from 6 separate companies (with at least 4 other companies unfortunately unable to attend, but keen to be kept informed of future CASCADE events), the oil and gas authority and 7 UK universities. 

There was opportunity for questions and discussion over the different projects, cores on display, and some of the wider issues surrounding Carboniferous mudstones in the UK. The core discussions were succeeded by a discussion session, which provided a useful opportunity to talk about what the current geological challenges which the UK shale gas industry in Carboniferous exploration. Some questions which had already been raised were further discussed and a general consensus of the direction which funded research should take to resolve some of the greatest challenges.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The outcomes of this discussion were suggested as potential MSc and PhD (including CASE partnership) research projects, as well those challenges which would be more suitable as a Joint Industry Partnership (JIP) project. The associated costs (included for all attendees in the booklet) and problems with attracting students to these projects were discussed.
