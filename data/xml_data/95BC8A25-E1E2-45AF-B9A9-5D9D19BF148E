It will study hearing infants of deaf mothers who use a sign language as their dominant language (HoD infants) in comparison to hearing infants of hearing mothers (HoH infants). Despite normal hearing, HoD infants have a different early experience of speech and language to that of HoH infants.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First, since deaf signing mothers are less likely to use auditory speech than hearing mothers, their infants are likely to have reduced exposure to auditory spoken language.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Second, the experience of HoD infants includes both a language in the visual modality, eg British Sign Language (BSL), and one in the auditory modality, eg English. Since HoD infants are exposed to two languages, they will be compared to HoH individuals who are exposed to two spoken languages.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will use near infrared spectroscopy and eye-tracking to test the hypothesis that the experience of HoD infants influence their neural representation of language, their patterns of eye gaze during spoken and signed language perception and their audio-visual speech integration.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research investigates language processing in hearing infants with deaf parents (HoD infants). These individuals have typically been included in research as a control group for their deaf siblings and have rarely been studied in their own right. Consequently, very little is understood about their language development and their neural representation of language. Speech and language impairments (including deficits in phonology, comprehension and vocabulary) have been reported in some HoD children compared to hearing children with hearing parents (HoH) exposed to only one spoken language (15). Reduced reading proficiency has also been observed in HoD adults compared to monolingual HoH adults (14). These results are suggestive of long-lasting effects of their early speech and language experience. However, since an appropriate control group of bilinguals has not been included in these studies, bilingualism offers an alternative explanation. The present project aims to enhance the quality of life of hearing individuals with deaf parents by providing a better understanding of their early language development and communicative needs. This project will also study for the first time how sign language is represented in the brain of infants. This aspect of the project will provide novel information about the native acquisition of sign language, which could be useful to deaf parents using sign language with their young children as well as to hearing parents of deaf children. 

 This project will also compare HoD infants with infants of hearing parents (HoH) growing up in a monolingual or bilingual environment. Results will clarify the early communicative development and neural representation of language in bilingual infants, whether they are cross-modal bilinguals (in a signed and a spoken language) or unimodal bilinguals (in two spoken languages). In the UK, 16.8% of primary school pupils are born into families where English is not the home language (2011 figures) and bilingual families represent a growing segment of the UK population (16). Consequently, this aspect of the project could enhance the quality of life of a significant number of families in the UK and abroad by clarifying the communicative needs of their young children.

Moreover, this study also aims to elucidate the role of prenatal and early postnatal experience on brain development and language learning. The results may provide a better understanding of experience-dependent plasticity and of brain and cognitive development in populations with early experience that differ from the norm, such as infants of depressed mothers or infants born with a visual or auditory impairment. In the long term, this line of research has the potential to help health providers develop better support and intervention for these infants. 

Finally, parents of young children, or other people with an interest in infant development are also likely to be interested in the results of this research project. A survey of 105 parents with young infants revealed that speech and language development are considered of high interest and high importance to them and they rated this topic as the second of 15 topics for which they would like to see more research funding (17).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>171528</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scientific advisor Funky Madarin Education</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>50147BC0-527F-4011-94ED-C4091AFA12BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Advise about the science of bilingual language development to Dr. Joanne Jin Zhang, founder of a website designed to teach Mandarin to babies and toddlers</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Brain science workshop for young children</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>53CA0E04-3671-4CC4-AA7D-315B2DDE8013</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop for 60 Year 2 children about the brain.
