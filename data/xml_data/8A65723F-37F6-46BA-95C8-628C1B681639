G&amp;ouml;del's Second Incompleteness Theorem of 1931 sabotages Hilbert's programme by showing that e.g. even a theory as rich as PA can't prove its own consistency, let alone prove the consistency of stronger, more infinitary, theories. But G&amp;ouml;del's epoch-making result doesn't totally foreclose the possibility of informative consistency proofs of interesting theories. And beginning in 1936, Gerhard Gentzen gave four somewhat different proofs of the consistency of arithmetic. The idea is to use a background theory which is weaker in some respects but stronger in others to prove the consistency of PA.\n\nThese results are again epochal, kick-starting the modern discipline of proof-theory. Yet even now there are no agreed 'book' versions of the two main lines of proof (meaning transparently clear, elegant, versions realizing the proof ideas in what -- with hindsight -- are optimal ways, without distracting clutter). For example, there is a folkloric suggestion that a cute version of Genzten's first proof can be developed by seeing the key reduction procedures in terms of the playing of a Hintikka game: but this idea -- which has probably independently struck a number of readers -- seems never to have been worked up into a canonical version. And it turns out that this actually isn't as easy as it sounds. So one task is to get the technicalities into the best possible order. \n\nDoing this isn't merely of technical aesthetic interest, however. On the contrary. Giving ideally perspicuous 'book' versions of proofs makes it transparent what their load-bearing ideas are, and how those ideas can or cannot be generalized in order to port the proofs to yield related results. Getting clear about such matters is an essential preliminary to further, more philosophical, discussion.\n\nAnd there remains a serious question about just what the philosophical significance of Gentzen's proofs is. This is far from obvious. One cluster of issues, of course, concerns what it takes conceptually to grasp transfinite inductions. The Hilbert school allowed at least some arguments by transfinite induction to count as finitistically acceptable: so if transfinite induction up to episilon_0 as needed by Gentzen is not finitistic, why not, exactly? Exactly what 'new thought' does it take to accept proofs involving such induction as compelling? What other conceptual/epistemological critical points are there as we consider stronger and stronger principles of induction?\n\nA related cluster of issues concerns the question of exactly what the availability of Gentzen-style consistency-proofs tells us about PA. When asked if Gentzen's work increased his confidence in the consistency of arithmetic, Kreisel famously jested 'By an epsilon.' Many have, at greater length, expressed much the same verdict. Are they right? If not (as I will argue), why not? And irrespective of whether the proofs might rationally increase our confidence in PA, just what else do they tell us?\n\nThere is a significant literature, but it would be generally agreed that no fully satisfactory treatment of these issues exists. And there is quite certainly no unified treatment which combines developing the technical aspects of the proofs in an elegant way with extended philosophical exploration. The Consistency of Arithmetic: Exploring Gentzen's Proofs will fill this very large and rather surprising gap.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21678</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H002545/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C6428B5-4A75-42D5-9D5B-5DF34F513B7E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science &amp; Maths, &amp; Math Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
