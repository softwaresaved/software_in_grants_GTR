Attitudes and Perceptions of Civilian Employers, Regulars and Significant Others</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L013002/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Summary

This study aims to explore the experiences of British Army reservists. It includes an analysis of their positive and negative interactions in regard to army employment, civilian employment and home lives, as well as the attitudes and perceptions of their civilian employers, regulars and significant others. 

A small number of international studies have examined inter-role conflict with community roles (e.g., emergency services volunteering), and suggest links with such conflict between volunteering and family life and outcomes including reduced satisfaction and intention to remain a volunteer (Cowlishaw et al., 2014), as well as partner distress (Cowlishaw et al., 2010a) and support for volunteering (Cowlishaw et al., 2010b). However, as far as can be ascertained, there are no studies which have explored the interface among additional and simultaneous competing roles, including the army reserves, primary employment and family life. This interface may be extremely complex, and reflect both positive and negative impacts of organisational and operational demands from the army reserves on primary employment and family, as well as bi-directional impacts of demands from these competing roles on the army reserves. 

Group identification has been positively related to improved interactions with others including perceptions of enhanced coping ability for individuals who feel supported by a member of a group they identify with as opposed to someone they consider an outsider (Platow et al., 2007). Furthermore, Sani et al. (p782, 2012) suggest that group identification gives individuals a &amp;quot;sense of meaning, permanence and stability, which protects against existential anxiety.&amp;quot; This implies that in terms of role preparedness, there is a need to ensure that reservists are not only fully integrated into an organisation but they also feel a core part of a team. This is highlighted by Lang et al (2010) who discuss the distinct nature of reservists' life because of the need for a normal day to day civilian existence but at the same time being ready and motivated in case of a call up and a sudden disruption. This study aims to identify resources for army reservists and their partners that can help minimise potential conflicts as well as enhance positive experiences of enrichment across the Reserve service and civilian roles.

Gorman and Thomas (1991) argue that although poor economic conditions have historically favoured regular Army recruitment, this may not be always the case for reservists because of the tendency for people to relocate away from low-employment areas to elsewhere to seek better opportunities. Moreover, as reservists are likely to be employed on a part-time basis by the Army their regular involvement may be impeded because of other priorities including employment, family and leisure activities. Indeed, Griffith's (2008) study into the motivations of American reservists identified two distinct groups - those that are motivated because they have a sense of duty and those that are materially motivated, with the author identifying the latter group as not only less committed but also less combat ready. This study will engage with reservists as well as their families, employers and regular service colleagues in order to explore the issues critical for their successful recruitment and deployment.

In addition to the literature review, focus groups and semi-structured interviews, further information will be gathered using documentary analysis and employment statistics to develop an understanding of the context within which these changes are taking place in the Armed Forces and how these may impact upon reservists' active participation in the army, as well as their families and employers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary

Our research has the potential to make a positive impact by increasing the effectiveness of the British Armed Forces recruitment and retention strategies as they seek to integrate reserves into one 'Whole Force'. We will achieve this by extending understanding of the social and economic factors which impact upon the recruitment and retention of army reservists; conducting new research to investigate the perceptions and in-depth experiences of reservists, their partners/family members, regulars and civilian employers; synthesising existing relevant research and documentary evidence surrounding the reservist initiative; and engaging and exchanging knowledge with key civilian and Armed Forces stakeholders. 

We will produce clear guidelines and practical and innovative solutions to the challenges of recruiting and retaining reservists across the whole armed forces. Guidelines will include the key contextual conditions from the 5 regional case studies. These will provide both regional and national findings which will support the formulation of policies and strategies to promote and sustain the UK Reservist service. The beneficiaries of the research will be wide ranging and will include:

- The UK Armed forces, including Army reserves, Royal Air Force reserves, Royal Navy reserves, Royal Marine reserves

- Policy makers in the Ministry of Defence

- Employers, through associations such as CBI, CIPD and through employer organisations such as SaBRE (Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers)

- HR Managers and Professionals of private and public sector organizations

- Organizations concerned with the health, mental health and wellbeing of reservists and their families (Army Families Federation, Army Welfare Service)

Our steering group will include key stakeholders representing employer organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors and trade unions along with organizations such as the Army Families Federation (AFF) and the Army Welfare Service (AWS). The research team will work with these stakeholders in order to disseminate the research findings using appropriate channels, events and media in order to reach employer groups, reservists and their families. We will ensure the key messages are accessible in different ways, including a project blog, presentations, policy briefings and concise separate guides for organizations and reservists and their families which we will promote on stakeholders' websites and Lancaster University website.

The research covered in this study relating to organizational behaviour and human resource management, including organizational change / restructuring, role conflict, work-life balance, health and wellbeing, volunteering, commitment, teamwork, support and flexible working will benefit the academic community through publications and dissemination events.

The Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators has extensive experience of advising and working with policy makers and undertaking research with both organizations and individuals. Working with the Armed Forces and organizations who are concerned with the health, mental health and wellbeing of reservists and their families provides knowledge and access to the people who are directly involved with the Reserve service. 

In order to achieve maximum impact from the research the working relationships will be two way: stakeholders are a valuable source of real world knowledge and expertise to the research team, whilst in return stakeholders will benefit from contact with the research team with access to the latest thinking to inform their networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234057</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Edinburgh</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Future Reserves Research Programme (FRRP)</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB932277-B192-4825-94E4-125D6C2041C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The three other projects involved in the Future Reserves Research Programme, include teams led by the Universities of Edinburgh, Exeter and Newcastle.
