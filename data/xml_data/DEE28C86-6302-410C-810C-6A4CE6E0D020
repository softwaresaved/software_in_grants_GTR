Barkcloth, or tapa, was widely used in tropical areas instead of weaving cloth on a loom and was used to create clothing, furnishings, carpeted pathways for royal weddings and funerals, and masks and garments for ritual and religious ceremonies. Sheets of the inner bark of trees and flowering plants were stripped and soaked to soften them, then beaten with wooden mallets to stretch the cloth and make it softer and stronger, before decorating it with painted designs. The production and use of barkcloth were disrupted by increasing western impact on the Pacific islands in the nineteenth century and in some areas missionaries completely suppressed its use. There is a continuous tradition of making barkcloth in some areas of the Pacific, but the skill has been lost in other islands, such as Hawai'i. Today the re-introduction or re-interpretation of barkcloth is an important aspect of cultural identity in these islands. 

Barkcloth was of great interest to travellers from the west, and Pacific barkcloth objects in western museums are a significant legacy from eighteenth and nineteenth century explorers, scientists and colonists. There are many good collections in museums in the UK and around the world but there are still major gaps in our understanding of it as a material. This project will examine the development of barkcloth production in the Pacific in the nineteenth century. We want to investigate whether materials, techniques and designs originated from particular islands, how they were transmitted around the region and the effect of globalisation on this tradition. This is important both for our understanding of objects in museum collections and for contemporary barkcloth makers in the Pacific. The project will focus on three internationally important collections at The Hunterian, University of Glasgow and The Economic Botany Collection at Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, in the UK, and The National Museum of Natural History, part of the USA's Smithsonian Institution. We will research the provenance and history of objects in the collections and analyse their materials and manufacture. We will also carry out fieldwork in the Pacific islands, talking to barkcloth makers, growers and designers and experimenting with making barkcloth using different plants and beating techniques.

We know that a variety of plants, including breadfruit, banyan and mamaki, were used to make barkcloth but it is often assumed that objects in western collections are made from the paper mulberry tree though in fact paper mulberry is not indigenous to the Pacific. However it is currently extremely difficult to identify barkcloth species because the fibres were badly damaged during production. The research will explore different identification techniques including the staining of sections, scanning-electron microscopy, protein analysis and DNA analysis. We aim to use some of these methods to identify the plant species in museum objects so that we have a better understanding of the plants used in different islands and how globalisation affected their use. An investigation of preservation and conservation techniques is an integral part of the project. Many barkcloth objects in museum collections are in poor condition; many pieces are very large and have been folded for storage but the cloth becomes brittle and inflexible with age and the folds become fixed. A programme of conservation treatment and improved storage will make the Hunterian and Kew artefacts accessible for current and future research. This will also improve our understanding of the physical properties of barkcloth; we will be looking for links between the objects' physical characteristics and degradation patterns and the plant species. This could result in different conservation treatments for objects depending on their fibre type or condition.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We envisage three main groups of beneficiaries in the professional and public arenas outside the academic community:
1. Conservation staff, both in museums and in commercial practice. 
It is standard conservation practice to approach an object in light of knowledge about its composition and history. At present for barkcloth there is a lack of systematic knowledge about either; consequently each piece must be approached as a new project. The project's insights into barkcloth history, material identification and conservation practice represent both a major resource for conservators, and a baseline for further research by practicing conservators. The development of identification techniques and improved reference materials will inform the assessment of pieces in collections beyond those of the three participating museums. A greater understanding of physical characteristics, degradation pathways and condition indicators will aid identification, even for museums which do not have access to expensive analytical equipment. This has direct benefits for conservators and contributes to the outcomes for museum and gallery visitors, below. 

2. Museum &amp;amp; gallery visitors.
Because of its portability and ubiquity in eighteenth and nineteenth century Pacific societies many museums have significant numbers of Pacific barkcloths, often on display to the public, and they are currently a popular subject for special exhibitions. The project will share its findings both with specialist Pacific curators (who fall within our academic beneficiaries) but also with generalist curators with wide responsibilities - a group represented by the project participants at the Hunterian and Kew. It has often been noted that European museums have rich Pacific collections, but notably little on display. In reaching curators, we expect to see an increase in the quantity and quality of barkcloth interpretation (and an increase in the number of pieces on display), leading to a greater understanding of and interest in barkcloth - a key element of Pacific cultures - among museum visitors. 

3. Contemporary makers and consumers of barkcloth in the Pacific.
While the main project activities are scheduled for the northern hemisphere, we are keenly mindful of the source communities for museum specimens, and their strong interest in preserving or - more often - reviving barkcloth production in the Pacific. Although we cannot resolve all the difficulties facing makers, we can tackle three. First, the project database and the improved catalogues of the participating museums will be a simple-to-use and obvious starting point for makers and other artists seeking inspiration and understanding of how barkcloth traditions have evolved. At present it is hard to locate barkcloth in museum catalogues, as terminology varies, key information is missing, and images are missing or poor. We envisage easier electronic access also leading to more visits by makers to museum collections, a pattern already visible from other web resources at Kew and the Hunterian. Second, the project outcomes will make technical information widely available on the raw materials, tools and processes involved in barkcloth making, drawing on evidence from analysis of museum specimens, literature, and fieldwork. Unlocking this kind of information, through written resources or the dissemination event, will enable makers to make better informed choices about materials. Thirdly, we expect the project web site and other forms of dissemination to further raise the profile of barkcloth, leading to greater value being placed by society on contemporary makers and their work. We recognise that resources such as the website will likely inspire both makers - or makers-to-be - who seek to preserve and revive traditional barkcloths, and those who are seeking innovation or artistic experimentation. Both are desirable outcomes, in that the project will be supporting barkcloth manufacture as a living practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>798834</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery</gtr:department><gtr:description>Project partnership with The Hunterian</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D5ADCB4-06DC-4D1F-AB1E-BFBDCB8933F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project team took part in a European Researchers' Night event in the museum: 'Hunterian Unlocked', on 30 September 2016.

The Conservation Researcher has received several enquiries from professional conservators internationally about the most appropriate methods of conserving barkcloth, and this has begun to make the project a focus for discussion and advice on the treatment of barkcloth. Some conservation information has been disseminated through the 'News' section of the project website, and this will be developed in the coming year. A two-day meeting of the Conservation Researcher, the Scientific Research Associate and museum conservators on the project's Advisory Panel, held in November 2016, featured in-depth discussion of barkcloth conservation techniques. The meeting was also attended by the Principal Textile Conservator of NMS and will impact directly on the conservation of barkcloth artefacts in that institution. The project team has also advised a small number of members of the public on caring for their own barkcloth artefacts. 

There has also been impact on students at the University of Glasgow - the MPhil Textile Conservation students particularly work at the boundary of the academic and professional worlds. Several formal teaching sessions and informal student volunteering have given the current student cohort a greatly improved understanding of working with this material (see information under Engagement Activities).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F1FD343C-277E-4313-A4E9-9F334C9D2B7E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key findings at the end of Year 1:

Collections and provenance research
The provenance of the Hunterian collection is much better understood. The research sample has expanded to include the collections of Aberdeen University Museums and Glasgow Museums - approximately another 200 cloths - greatly expanding our access to Fijian and Melanesian cloths, as well as to extremely rare Hawaiian cloths made from mamaki bast (Pipturus albidus), enabling more accurate attribution to place of origin than was previously possible. Analysis of the British Museum's barkcloth beaters from Central Polynesia identified key differences between Tahitian and Cook Islands barkcloth 'watermarks', resolving the uncertainty in differentiating between these to some extent. Review of the Tahitian cloths indicated a virtual absence in the existing literature of a distinctive form of recycled fleece-like cloth, motivating closer investigation of this particular fabric. Formal analysis has also indicated the impact of less prominent phases of cloth manufacture (principally, initial scraping, soaking and fermentation of the bast) in defining the textural nature of the finished cloth. This finding is vital - currently barkcloths are attributed primarily by their painting iconography, and so known differences in manufacturing methods between nations will allow key textural features visible with the naked eye to provide accurate and more straightforward cultural attributions for museum professionals and art historians. 

Dress history
Research into early pictorial and photographic sources has indicated wide variation in the wearing styles of what were previously thought to be fairly homogenous garment categories, and shows variation existing both within and between historical Polynesian societies with greater gender-neutrality in certain key garment types than previously emphasised in the literature. Research has also helped to reconstruct changing dress cultures in Polynesia over the 19th Century, as European influence introduced woven and printed textiles, and Christian missionaries introduced an entirely new set of Western dress conventions, ushering in an intermediate stylistic period where the two dress cultures were hybridised and produced distinctive garment forms.

Working with Pacific communities
A principle change to the art historical package of the project is involving closer collaboration with indigenous scholars or creative practitioners of Pacific Islander heritage, enabling a wider scope of ethnographic research and the field collection of fabric and pigment samples than planned. We have modified our plans to deliver a Pacific-based dissemination event in Year 3 into delivering two smaller consultation workshops in Year 2, in order to create productive dialogue between the project's research aims and the decolonialised perspectives apparent in the Pacific Islander communities in the scholarly centres of Auckland (NZ) and Hawaii (USA). 

Scientific findings
It is already clear that determining the plant species used to make a particular piece of barkcloth is even less straightforward than initially envisaged and that manufacturing methods such as fermentation have also had a large impact on the barkcloth's material properties and subsequent deterioration. One finding is that Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), used in wood science to determine species, wood types and degradation, is appropriate for barkcloth analysis. A database of standard samples is being created and the analysis of cloths in the Hunterian and Kew collections has begun. Initial exploration into other techniques indicates that there is potential in genome sequencing (DNA research) but that the use of light microscopy in combination with staining, traditionally used for plant identification, is not appropriate for this challenging material. Chromatographic techniques are being more straightforwardly employed to identify dyes, pigments and binding media used on the cloths. The technique of taking paint cross-section samples, traditionally used to understand and identify the layers of materials in artworks, is being employed for the first time to study the complex layered systems used to construct painted barkcloth. 

Conservation findings
Research into conservation treatments has identified solutions to particular problems, such as the novel use of transmitted light to document images of beater marks; methods of cold-dyeing Japanese paper to use as an unobtrusive support for damaged areas; research into the use of appropriate adhesives for applying support to oiled barkcloth; the use of remoistenable tissue coated with starch paste for adhesive support and the use of different infill materials to bridge gaps in pandanus, a plant material used to make upeti, or rubbing boards, for decorating barkcloth.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The collections and dress historical findings will be disseminated through a variety of channels, including the Museum Ethnographers Group conference being held at the University of Glasgow on 6-7 April 2017, to specialist curators and art historians, informing the understanding, display and interpretation of historic Pacific barkcloth artefacts in museums in the UK and internationally. Individual catalogue records for objects in the collections of The Hunterian, Glasgow Museums and Aberdeen University Museums have been improved as a result of project findings, and this work will extend to other collections. 

Greater collaboration with Pacific practitioners and scholars is being developed, through individual contacts and plans for fieldwork and dissemination in the Pacific region, and this will greatly enhance the research findings, informing both the understanding and interpretation of historic collections in the Pacific, and the contemporary making of barkcloth artefacts. 

56 artefacts from the Hunterian and Kew collections have been treated and re-housed to date, making them far more easily accessible to researchers; the majority were previously too fragile to be safely examined. Previous conservation treatments of objects from the Kew collection carried out by students of the Textile Conservation Centre have been evaluated and a paper submitted to the International Council of Museums Conservation Committee conference in September 2017; this will inform the treatment of barkcloth by conservators.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3155CE9C-08BC-47D4-8E7C-E36540C7A5F9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.tapa.gla.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>New teaching sessions for MPhil Textile Conservation students</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6AC8CBC6-360C-47F6-A490-1C1B39AD3583</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two formal, research-led teaching sessions were introduced to the MPhil Textile Conservation curriculum at the University of Glasgow in 2016-17. Teams of first and second year students worked together, alongside the project Conservation Researcher, to examine barkcloth objects which presented particular ethical and practical problems for conservation and to debate and present appropriate conservation solutions. This was an excellent method of developing research-led teaching, which engaged the students with real-life situations and encouraged them to think about the wider context for conservation decision-making. The Conservation Researcher also taught a new session on the conservation or ethnographic artefacts, focusing on both practical and ethical issues. Alongside students' voluntary contribution to the barkcloth project, three cohorts of students are gaining significant experience of working with this material. This new material will be retained as part of the curriculum after the completion of the three-year project.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4C2E47C6-AAEE-442E-A7B6-0DD06B89B442"><gtr:id>4C2E47C6-AAEE-442E-A7B6-0DD06B89B442</gtr:id><gtr:title>Breaking down banners: analytical approaches to determining the materials of painted banners</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Heritage Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6174d851e88487fed8422110a02b660f"><gtr:id>6174d851e88487fed8422110a02b660f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M00886X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5D547CF-808C-4FE7-AD85-299BC2409614</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Of Art &amp; Textiles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
