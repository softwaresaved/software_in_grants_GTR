Authority, Authorship and Voice</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J012769/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The key aim of this project will be the development of a multi-disciplinary research network that will, first, interact on the issues surrounding creation and publication of the Digital Manual during the six month period and, second, will be charged with a generative role in determining related research questions and activities thereafter with a view to seeking a longer and larger grant to explore those questions. The development of such a research network will be aided and informed by a scoping study of open source creative communities and a research workshop. 

A scoping study will be conducted examining four creative communities that utilise technology to create and publish digital manual(s): FakePress Publishing (Italy/global), FLOSS Manuals (Netherlands/global), UpStage (UK/New Zealand/global), and Sauti ya Wakulima (Spain/Tanzania). These case studies reflect upon the nature of co-creation in networked communities that are international, multi-locational and transcultural. Employing qualitative research methods (semi-structured interviews and focus groups), the research team will investigate the structures of power within these creative communities. The case studies will explore representations and understandings of multi-authored digital texts and changing notions of authorship, control and power.

This project defines the Digital Manual as a model of emergent multi-authored publication employing open source and co-creative practices and each of the above communities employ a slight different type of Digital Manual. Such digital manuals, emerging forms of the book, function as a resource and platform for digital practitioners, including artists, in their use and manipulation of technology for new forms of writing and publishing. More broadly, studying the digital manual relates to concerns with emerging forms of authorship, production and knowledge-making and how these might be intrinsic to processes of social formation. 

For example, FakePress Publishing provides a series of ubiquitous technology and augmented reality publishing platforms as well as online workshops which function as a resource for other digital practitioners, new media artists, university students and individuals interested in learning about these new forms of publishing. FakePress Publishing also organises domestic and international workshops for different audiences (e.g. web designers, digital artists, university postgraduate courses and secondary education programmes). Both these activities allow the members of FakePress Publishing to share practices as well as co-create digital publications and enable a physical and virtual creative community to form. Engaging the structures of interpersonal relations within this type of emerging creative community can help in investigating shifts in authority and voice, within co-creative practices, more widely. Further, open source philosophy underlies the aims and activities of the community. This indicates presence of motivations, meanings and value associated with use of open licensing as well as the process of collaborative authorship. This has wider implications for understanding changing notions of control and ownership over creative output in the digital era as well as potential to inform regulatory frameworks, such as copyright law. 

The final stage of the project will be a two-day workshop where network members and case study participants will participate in a series of discussions on the findings of the scoping study. During the workshop, the research team will aim to identify possibilities for future collaboration and the establishing of a consortium to investigate themes and issues emerging from the project. This project, through empirical knowledge gathered from primary research and development of a research network of experts on the topic (academics, practitioners and artists), will be a stepping stone for further in-depth study of digital co-creation and publication.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will have a number of beneficiaries from academia, creative practices, new media arts, creative commons and a wider public interested in digital publications, co-creative practices, authorship and copyright. Outside of the academic sector, this research will be relevant to several creative communities both directly and indirectly involved in this project as well those not involved in this project.

Direct beneficiaries (non-academic):
- Artists, practitioners and projects that are part of the study: these groups and individuals will benefit from having their projects documented and evaluated, and from the final report. Case studies' participants will be engaged as direct beneficiaries of the research process from the outset, through online discussions with the research team and the network members.The process of contributing to the research will be an opportunity for them to think about and plan for the improved sustainability of their projects. The case studies' participants will have the opportunity to meet one another and network members to exchange views and experiences on the focal issues of this project but also on their creative practices. Similarly, the creative communities that form part of the case studies can be indirect beneficiaries of the research process. For example, since one of the project's aim is to investigate the structures of power within the four case studies, the research team would look at the different voices present in these creative communities. 
- Other creative communities for co-creation and digital publication: the research will benefit other creative communities that are sustaining co-creative practices and digital publications by providing useful documentation, models and ideas and fostering discourse in this field. The research team, with the assistance of the four creative communities and network members, will target other similar communities and liaise with them to disseminate this research. 
- The non-academic network members (i.e. Michel Bauwens, Chris Meade) of the project will also be direct beneficiaries. The research questions of the project complement the research interests and activities of the non-academic network members', such as co-creation, digital publication, the future of the book; history of copyright; and the formation of creative communities and the structure of social relations within them. The project will allow non-academic network members to reflect on their own practices and engage in dialogues on how their interests intersect with those of other network members during the project. In addition, it may serve as a platform for networking and collaboration out with the duration of the project. 

Other non-academic beneficiaries:
- Artists and practitioners considering initiating co-creative and multi-voiced projects: this research could be a valuable tool for artists and practitioners considering initiating co-creative projects using open source software within their particular discipline, as it may help them to avoid common pitfalls and save time and resources by learning from others' experiences. The workshop will also be beneficial to local new media artists who will be invited to participate on the second day.
- General public: An essential activity and outcome of this project will be a multi-media weblog hosted by the University of Edinburgh (remaining publicly available for at least five years after the end of the project). It will consist of the final report on the scoping study as well as documentation of project activities, such as extracts from interviews and discussion texts. This weblog will be open and free to the general public. The weblog and report will be promoted widely through open source networks, online arts communities, academic networks and other communities of interest.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21882</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Limerick</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>From Sharing to Caring: Examining Socio-Technical Aspects of the Collaborative Economy</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0DADAE4-4D4D-4685-8AAA-51734B644395</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The COST Action will produce online resources including publications offering a comprehensive view of the current European collaborative economy and socio-technical and policy recommendations for the future.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This COST Action involves 27 member states and institutions.

In their on-going research, they have been using a feminist approach grounded on notions of care and affect, which are nomadic, fluid, reflective, playful and non-profit, to explore how debates about distributed networks intersect with those on the concept of the 'commons'; that is with knowledge resources that are collectively created, owned or shared between the members of the network, and are available to third parties.Commons, therefore, are there to be used and reused, rather than to be exchanged as a commodity. In transmediale 2015, CN: FM brought together scholars, practitioners and artists who are members of cyberfeminist collectives, such as Genderchangers and Constant Association for Art and Media, to develop a feminist methodology that facilitates movement, processing and exchange of ideas and practices in multiple directions amongst and across diverse networks with in an ethos that engages with creativity as commons. This event was supported by the University of Edinburgh (RKEO grant, &amp;pound;2000).
Aiming to address issues of moving from theory to practice, and to set up a network which can pursue further the development of a range of current conceptual and technological approaches to the notion of feminist server, the event included:
- a workgroup discussion on feminist methodologies to technology and distributed networks
- a hands-on workshop focused a) on the notions of the feminist server leading to observations about the nature of a network focusing on feminist approaches to technology and b) the development of an offline network of individuals, groups and collectives who will initiate further theoretical on feminist methodologies to technology and practical work on the feminist server
- a presentation of the outcomes of the two previous sessions, including a 'launch' of a network dealing with the above issues</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://transmediale.de/content/commoning-the-networks-a-feminist-methodology-ii</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Speaker at CIRCLE Online Symposium 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D96055AB-DA7E-465B-B138-D0B2ECC8B37A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a one-day intensive online workshop/symposium to discuss co-creative practices.

In the second part, we presented case studies of feminist practices of networked communities active in the field of digital technology, art and open source. We addressed the following issues and topics: 
1) Short historical background on the role of women in production of the commons;
2 ) Feminism and politics of the commons;
3 ) Women and digital illiteracy;
4 ) Examples of production the commons in digital communities , networks and facilities through feminist practices.
Finally, in the workshop we screened short clips/interviews with research partners who worked in the same field: Dr Sophia Lycouris (ECA), Amit Rai (Queen Mary, University of London) and Helen Varley Jamieson (a cyberformer artist and activist).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Guest Speaker in Opening Roundtable (Unusual Suspects Festival Glasgow 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>204F2CF3-9B93-464B-8116-287F32AC29E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Unusual Suspects Festival 2015 in Glasgow was a three-day event of ideas, solutions and debate exploring what happens when social innovation meets collaboration and how together we can meet some of society's most pressing challenges.

In the project, we adopted a reflective approach and queried the meaning of the term 'digital manual' itself as well the suitability of terms like &amp;quot;text, book, and publication&amp;quot; for digital creation and output. Questions to this effect formed part of both the scoping study and the workshop.

The project was aimed at engaging primarily with the issue of &amp;quot;text&amp;quot;, albeit in an expanded form (as such it also looked at performance and creativity e.g. the case studies involved utilization of technology to provide and improve possibilities for performance). However, one important finding in this respect was the need to look beyond the concept of 'text' itself, as well as the 'manual' as a 'textual object.' The terms &amp;quot;text, book, and publication&amp;quot; have broad yet entrenched meanings within various disciplines and practices and an inter-disciplinary project may benefit from the use of language of 'the digital' rather analogue as well as a focus on the 'practices of making and remaking' rather than the output itself e.g. a publication. In this way, the project helped us in understanding as well as moving beyond our initial definition and contextualization of the term 'digital manual.'

In the digital environment, building trust amongst digital practitioners and their audience and equally between academics and non-academics was also found to be an important challenge in itself.

The project helped confirm the importance of several issues that were explored within the case studies as well identify new related and relevant issues:

There are several challenges in co-creative projects that are based around utilizing the potential of digital technologies to transform practices of creation and publication. Some examples of relevant issues are: a) while there is presence of expanded notions of authorship and ownership in collaborative practices, there is lack of clear or settled norms at the moment b) there are several areas of tensions between assertion or exploitation of authorship and ownership with the purpose of community formation in digital co-creative activities c) while there is no one model to fund co-creative practices, there are important tensions between economic sustainability in open collaborative projects with fairness and reciprocity amongst the participants d) the role of Intellectual Property rights in co-creative practices (not just copyright but also patents and other rights) is pertinent and should be explored further particularly with a view to charting out emergent models of their exploitation in collaborative scenarios.

Although our initial scope was to look at online 'communities', the project showed that the focus should move towards 'networks'. For example, the keyword 'community' is limiting in its scope and definition as the scope of the projects of some case studies' participants is not to form communities but rather to enable and/or strengthen multiple voices within networks of users through sharing knowledge practices digitally.

Several relevant issues that were not explicitly within the scope of the project also emerged. Some examples are: censorship and identity and purpose of censors in co-creative scenario; inclusivity and exclusivity in process of community formation; language barriers and translation; trust among community members; and, readability and accuracy of digital manuals.

hile the project focused on the process of &amp;quot;creation and publication&amp;quot;, it emerged that this process cannot be segregated from &amp;quot;consumption and user experience&amp;quot; (e.g. because consumption is no more linear and the meanings involved are varied and continuously evolving). As such, a broader and more holistic scope which combines 'the creation and production process' with 'consumption, meaning making and further creation' would be useful in any further study on issues of authority and power in the digital environment.

As our research was focused on specific case studies, we came across some novel ideas on the definition of community-building, attribution and power structures in distributed networks of digital practitioners. Second, the findings can be also useful for the digital artist communities to understand in more depth issues around licensing and copyright as well as what strengthens their community e.g. trust, collaboration and peer production.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>44A2A606-8CAC-4A26-9F0A-75A8F1D03F5A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.eca.ed.ac.uk/digital-manual/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F566CB7F-6824-4295-87F4-EEC2448FC1FF"><gtr:id>F566CB7F-6824-4295-87F4-EEC2448FC1FF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electronic Literature Communities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a8f83f3aeb2c95dd8273d9728a86ac2c"><gtr:id>a8f83f3aeb2c95dd8273d9728a86ac2c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Travlou, P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn> 978-1-943665-01-3 (ePub)</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2306C494-D6F2-4682-A605-689FBD3E7676"><gtr:id>2306C494-D6F2-4682-A605-689FBD3E7676</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Autor&amp;iacute;a distributiva y comunidades creativas&amp;quot;
