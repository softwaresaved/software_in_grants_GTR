Members of Parliament are required on a daily basis to deal with issues that are widely varied, rapidly evolving and increasingly complex, from rising levels of obesity to cyber security and environmental change. These challenges cannot be adequately addressed by simply using common sense, experience, precedent, or ideological principles; information is vital and comes in a variety of formats, from statistics to consultation responses, and from a range of different sources, including individual experts, groups of stakeholders and the wider public. Scientific research has a key role to play in providing decision makers with the best available evidence to inform their considerations and to hold Government to account effectively; however, high quality research in and of itself is not enough to ensure that decision making - in any context - is informed by it.

In recognition of the benefits of scientific research to inform policy, UK Government has in recent years developed comprehensive and formal structures of science advice - broadly defined here as practices involving individuals, organisations and structures that mobilise knowledge from across the social, natural, engineering and medical sciences. Senior government officials and ministers now have access to vast numbers of government researchers and networks of external science advice to support them in their work, with an increased focus on the use of social science research and expertise. By contrast, science advice structures in Parliament are much less mature, and much more needs to be done to enable Parliamentarians to use the insights generated from publicly funded research to inform their considerations.

In this context, mobilising multidisciplinary knowledge is essential to meet domestic and global challenges and inform the consideration of pressing social problems. Realising this requires effective knowledge exchange (KE) to ensure that UK social science research meets the needs of, and is used by, Parliamentarians and the staff supporting them. Efforts to enhance awareness and use of social science research within Parliament only gained real traction with the establishment of a Social Science Section (SSS) in the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) three years ago. In partnership with University College London (UCL) and the support of the ESRC, over the last three years the SSS has embedded social science across POST's work and developed a stream of social science work to support Parliamentarians, as well as run a programme of research to understand the ways in which research is used in Parliament. This project will build on the foundational work completed to embed social science research and knowledge at the heart of Parliament thereby enabling more effective governance of our democratic society. Specifically, it will use existing evidence to implement innovative and effective KE approaches in POST and across Parliament, including providing Parliamentarians and the staff supporting them with direct access to cutting edge, interdisciplinary academic knowledge that is effectively synthesised and packaged for timely consumption, together with training to develop the skills base needed to make use of this. It will also facilitate links between the research community and Parliament, to increase academics understanding of the ways that they can engage with Parliament through their research, and enhance knowledge and practice about effective KE and the policy impact of academic research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit two groups:
1.Parliamentary users (mainly in Westminster including POST, MPs and Peers, MP's staff, and Parliamentary staff, but also the devolved administrations)
2.The research community (academics and research brokers such as Research Councils, Learned Societies and Professional Associations)

These groups will benefit in a number of ways (more information is provided in the Case for Support and the Pathways to Impact statement)

The launch event was hosted by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Rt. Hon John Bercow MP, and the Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler. The first of these schemes, the Parliamentary Academic Fellowship Scheme, is managed by POST and endorsed by the Research Councils. Funded by monies made available to universities to increase the impact of their research (Impact Acceleration Accounts), the Scheme includes opportunities for academics to work on specific projects proposed by offices inside Parliament, as well as enabling academics to propose their own project. The second scheme is the House of Commons Fellowship Scheme, run in partnership with the Political Studies Association (PSA), which has awarded five fellowships to senior political and social scientists from universities across the UK to study an aspect of the Westminster parliament. 

The event included speeches from The Rt Hon. John Bercow MP, Speaker of the House of Commons, The Rt Hon. the Lord Fowler, the Lord Speaker, Dr Kedar Pandya, Associate Director, Business, EPSRC and Helena Djurkovic, Chief Executive Officer, Political Studies Association.

To date, POST has received 68 enquiries from academics, resulting in 22 applications from academics across 16 institutions. Interviews are currently underway and the first fellows will begin their placements shortly.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/fellowships/parliamentary-academic-fellowship-scheme/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hosted: Childhood Obesity Strategy</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76286BFD-6B42-4A5B-BE43-A421C54BD666</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Government's Childhood Obesity Plan was published in August 2016. The strategy has been widely criticised by a range of stakeholders and is under considerable scrutiny, following the Health Select Committee's recent inquiry on childhood obesity and Public Health England's policy report outlining an evidence-based approach to reducing sugar consumption. The event was hosted on 7 December 2016 in Portcullis House, Westminster and was chaired by Maggie Throup MP, Member of the Health Select Committee and Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Adult and Childhood Obesity. This event was an opportunity for parliamentarians to hear directly from policy officials at the Department about their plans for the policy since it was published. 

The Panel highlighted the value of evaluating policy impacts over the short and long-term, the important contribution to the evidence base made by longitudinal studies, the role of consumer behaviour (which they felt had been overlooked in the obesity plan), the importance of a focus on maternal health, infancy and early years nutrition and health, and the role that social inequalities play in the risk of becoming obese. The audience and panel then discussed the issues raised; the event concluded with a response from the Department of Health and closing remarks from the Chair, who expressed the view that parliamentary scrutiny of the matter by the Health Select Committee and through the activities of relevant APPGs would continue in 2017.

The speakers were Dr Jean Adams, Senior Research Fellow, MRC Epidemiology Unit &amp;amp; Centre for Diet and Activity Research, University of Cambridge; Professor Paul Dobson, Professor of Business Strategy and Public Policy and Head of Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia; Professor Mary Fewtrell, Professor of Paediatric Nutrition, University College London Institute of Child Health; Professor Rebecca Hardy, Scientific Programme Leader, Medical Research Council Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London; Gillian Prior, Head of Health and Biomedical Surveys, NatCen Social Research and Richard Sangster, Head of the Obesity Policy Team at the Department of Health. 

The audience of 68 people included Members and staff from both Houses, as well as stakeholders from over 20 institutions including Public Health England; the British Medical Association; the Daily Mail; New Statesman; CLOSER Longitudinal Research Group at University College London; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; The Food Foundation; Sainsbury's; Tesco and various academic and research institutions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/childhood-obesity/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Outreach event with Newton's Apple</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0A590E5D-1CE4-4A1E-9E74-F4BAA527281A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Hobbs participated in an outreach workshop at Imperial University on 16 February 2017, hosted by Newton's Apple.

It was co-hosted by POST, the House of Commons Library and Parliament's Universities Programme in collaboration with Research Councils UK (RCUK). The purpose of the day was to discuss the effect of Brexit on different policy areas and help researchers and academics to connect, network and share expertise and ideas. 

The keynote was given by Professor Anand Menon, Professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs, Kings College London and Director of the ESRC UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. Attendees also heard from Phil Sooben, Director for Policy and Research and Deputy Chief Executive, ESRC, Patrick Vollmer, Director of Library Services, House of Lords and Penny Young, Librarian and Head of Participation, Research and Information at the House of Commons.

Attendees were able to view stalls showcasing key RCUK investments and to discuss these with the academics and RCUK staff involved in these projects. There were also six parallel facilitated discussion groups on different policy areas which allowed academics and parliamentary researchers to discuss issues in more depth. Write-ups from each of the six sessions are available on POST's website, and POST's Director also wrote a blog about the day on Second Reading, the House of Commons Library blog.

The conference was open to parliamentary and Members' researchers from all four nations. Academics were invited to apply to take part via an open call. We received 210 applications from academics to take part in the discussion sessions, which were sifted by a cross-House panel of staff. 36 academics were selected to take part in the discussion sessions. A further 40 academics and RCUK staff were selected by RCUK to run the stalls in the Attlee Suite showcasing relevant RCUK-funded research. In total over 100 attendees took part, including Westminster staff across both Houses, MPs' staff and researchers from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. 

59 participants completed the feedback survey. The main reasons participants gave for attending were: to make new parliamentary and academic contacts and to find out about new research. 93% said that the event was excellent (49%) or good (44%) overall. 100% said that they would be interested in attending similar events in the future. The conference has already led to several impacts. For example, the details of all academics who applied to take part/ took part in the conference (and who gave permission) have had their details shared with parliamentary delegates. Feedback from colleagues indicates that these have already been used, for example, to aid background research to Select Committee inquiries, and to circulate calls for evidence for Brexit-related inquiries. Because of the contacts established through the conference, some of the participating academics have also been invited to give talks to other parliamentary colleagues, or to take part in other parliamentary events. We are also in discussion about using the contacts established as the basis for a series of Brexit related events as part of the MPs Professional Development programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/brexit-an-academic-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Parliament Universities Programme regional conferences with academics on engaging with Parliament</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3856977E-3457-4B03-8123-AAFC1C3016A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>POST SSS supports the delivery of monthly regional conferences that are hosted by Parliament's Universities Programme. These are for academics of all career grades and disciplines. Each conference begins with an introduction to the UK Parliament, before the main group is divided into three parallel streams, which each cover 'Academics and the UK Parliament', 'Engaging with UK Parliamentarians' and 'What is good Select Committee evidence?'. One of the SSS team delivers the session on 'Academics and the UK Parliament', which covers the findings from the analysis of impact case studies referring to engagement with Parliament that were submitted to Research Excellence Framework 2014 as part of Phase 1. Since October 2016, Dr Caroline Kenny has delivered this session at Birbeck (October 16), Manchester (November 2016), Southampton (January 2017), Glasgow (March 2017) and Bristol (March 2017).

At this event leading experts from clinical research disciplines discussed the consequences of a woman's health before and during pregnancy for subsequent generations, following up on the issues raised in the Chief Medical Officer's 2015 Annual Report. The scientific discussions comprised key findings from a special series of articles on maternal health which was published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology in October 2016. The presentations were followed by a discussion between the panel and audience, covering a wide range of issues including health professionals' attitudes to discussing obesity with patients, interventions in the ante-natal care pathway, national policy on diet and healthy eating, and finally the extent to which the government's childhood obesity plan would have an impact on women and their babies in the future.

? Contribution to fourteen peer-reviewed briefings for parliamentarians (POSTnotes), including Green Space and Health (2016) and Research Integrity (2017).
? Published three peer-reviewed briefings for parliamentarians, including Academic Evidence on Selective Secondary Education, which was used to inform the considerations of the House of Commons Education Committee 2017 Evidence check on Grammar schools and cited in the report. 
? Hosting 5 events for parliamentarians, their staff and House staff. This has included two events with the Institute for Fiscal Studies ahead of the 2016 Autumn Statement and the 2017 Spring Budget, which were used to inform parliamentary briefing work for Members. It also included hosting a Brexit conference in November 2016 with the House of Commons Library, Parliament's Universities Programme and Research Councils UK (RCUK) to bring together over 100 parliamentary researchers and academics from across the UK to consider some of the key policy areas affected by the UK's decision to leave the EU. Networks established by the conference have been used, for example, to provide background research and contacts to Select Committee and to invite academics to take part in other parliamentary events. 
? Providing social science research and expertise to five Select Committees across the Commons and Lords, such as presentations to Committee members, advice on relevant academic experts (for witnesses or specialist advisers) and guidance on interpreting evidence. It included in-depth qualitative analysis of the experiences and perspectives of individuals personally affected by suicide, submitted in memos not recommended for publication, for the House of Commons Health Select Committee inquiry on Suicide Prevention and cited in the 2016 interim report.
? Supporting the Administration Committee in undertaking qualitative research to understand better the needs of Members and their staff and evaluate House services. For example, a project on Members and Members' staff perspectives on the House of Commons Library legislative briefing support (2017), which is being used to inform Commons business processes in the Research and Information Team. 
? Developing and piloting tailored continuing professional development for parliamentary staff. This has included a session for new specialists in the House Of Commons Committee Office on finding and appraising research, and supporting three Select Committees to trial the use of different qualitative data software packages to manage large qualitative datasets. 
? Developing and launching a Parliamentary Academic Fellowship Scheme to enable post-PhD researchers to undertake placements across Parliament, supported by funding from the ESRC and EPSRC Impact Acceleration Accounts. The first fellows will begin their placements in April 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2C434D5F-A3CE-4539-A15B-DBFA7205B52F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Supporting Select Committees to trial the use of different qualitative data software packages to manage large qualitative datasets</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4BE1AFCE-23C7-434A-98C9-CADE5681580B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Showcased qualitative data software packages to Select Committee staff interested in finding new and more effective ways to manage large qualitative datasets.
