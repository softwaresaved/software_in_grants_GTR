This project investigates one group of migrant care workers, women from the Philippines, who live and work in London and Hong Kong, two important destinations for Filipino migrant care and domestic workers. Our aim is to use art events and public exhibitions to increase migrant welfare in the places they live and work and enhance the benefits of migration for themselves, their families and their home country. The work that these migrant domestic and care workers undertake elsewhere enables them to build houses and invest in the future of family and loved ones who are left at home. More broadly their remittances collectively account for a significant percentage of GDP in their home country. Scholars debate whether those remittances contribute to longer term development. However, they generally agree that the development benefits of migration would be substantially greater if migrant rights to a fair wage and good working conditions were protected and if migrants invested not just in personal consumption but in sustainable social and economic enterprises.
 
Working closely in collaboration with our non-academic partners, community based and charitable organisations in London, Hong Kong and Manila, we will run a series of art events and public exhibitions about Filipino migrant care workers. Migrant care workers themselves will be centrally involved in producing and curating the art events and exhibitions. First, using photographic and collage techniques with objects and images from social media, camera phones, posted photographs and personal collections, we will ask migrants to illustrate both their experiences as migrant care workers living abroad and their contributions to development in their home country. We will use the images they produce to engage migrants in conversations both about their everyday concerns and welfare needs and about their future aspirations for themselves, their families and their home country. Second, working with both migrants and our non-academic partners, we will select some of the images they produce to be professionally printed and displayed in a series of public exhibitions to be held in each city. We will also commission two original pieces of art work from Filipino visual artists residing in London and Hong Kong respectively to contribute to the exhibition.
 
Together, the images and art works created and displayed at those events and exhibitions will help to raise public awareness about the vital work that these migrant care workers perform and help us show that by protecting migrant rights and ensuring their welfare we enhance the welfare of those that they care for both in home and in host countries. The art and public exhibitions, together with the workshops we organize around the exhibitions, will also generate discussions among migrants and with policy makers and collectively enable them to identify new ways to increase the longer term benefit and development impact of migrants' investments.
 
Scholars and activists have for some time now actively sought to challenge the view that migrant care and domestic workers are simply 'maids to order' . That has led to a better appreciation for the skills these women acquire and the creativity they exercise in overcoming different sorts of social boundaries and cultural barriers. However, those migrant care workers are still largely left out of conversations about migration and development in their home country. Through novel use of art and public exhibitions this project will bring these creative and resourceful people into that conversation and jump start those long overdue dialogues about development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is concerned with the welfare of Filipino migrants, the people directly dependent on them and the impact they make on development in their home country. Through art events and exhibitions we seek to make visible the relation between migrant welfare and development impacts in home country and enable new ways of conceiving migrants' contribution to both households and home country. The potential beneficiaries of this project are: 

1. Filipino migrant care-workers.

The first beneficiaries of our work will be the migrants who participate as co-curators in the community based art events. Producing and curating visual images of their material contributions and investments they make in the Philippines will afford opportunity to creatively reflect on their conceptualisations of development and identify new ways their collective contributions to the public good may be enhanced and better supported by government and third sector organisations. 

2. Project partners and other community based migrant organisations in London and Hong Kong.

The participation of Kanlungan (London) and Enrich (HK) in organising the planned community based art events will both encourage, and provide models for, an expanded use of art and other performative events to stimulate critical conversations about the relation between migration and development that can be extended to other similar community based organisations. The events aim also to increase migrant participation and investment in the work of these civic organisations that provide vital welfare services for their constituents but frequently struggle to find the resources needed to continue their work.

3. Project partner in the Philippines - Scalabrini Migration Center (SMC). 

For the SMC participation in organising the project exhibition opens up a new visual and curatorial strand to its long established work as an independent producer and repository of migration literature. Printed and digital images for the exhibition will be deposited with the SMC and encourage the development of a new archive of visual culture focused on migration and development in the Asia Pacific. 

4. Policy makers and migrant advocacy groups in the Philippines. 

The principle benefit for policy makers and advocacy groups are threefold: a) an enhanced awareness of the work of community based migrant organisations in London and Hong Kong and the issues facing Filipino migrants; b) better appreciation of the range of migrant investment in the Philippines; and c) opportunity to consider what sorts of policy changes might be necessary to enhance migrant welfare and increase opportunities to contribute to development processes in the Philippines. 

5. Impact on arts practitioners and museums in the multidisciplinary field of visual art. 

The exhibitions in London, Hong Kong and Manila will include curated images from the community art based projects and work commissioned from Filipino artists. Together the exhibitions will encourage art practitioners to consider how and in what ways visual arts might become involved in dialogues about migration and development. More broadly this project proposes an alternative to how anthropological museums and exhibitions deal with contemporary forms of mobility and cultural diversity: usually objects from the stores, dealing with the lives of past peoples. Our project will encourage museum and galleries to consider their role in dialogues about contemporary development.

6. General public impact: 

The exhibitions, workshops and discussions held as a part of this project in London, HK and Manila will be open to the public. This project aims to increase interest in and understanding of the relations between migration and development, as well as to raise awareness both about the constraints that migrants face and about the creative cultural practices that enable them to overcome the obstacles they face and contribute to their home country.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80780</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P007678/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8E63C4A9-31AC-4950-BF4C-643F945B707F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asian &amp; Middle Eastern Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
