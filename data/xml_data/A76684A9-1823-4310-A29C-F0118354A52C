Spectrometer-based systems currently on the market for this purpose are cumbersome, have a large power requirement, require frequent recalibration by trained operators and provide data based on hidden algorithms that limit interpretation of the resulting data. Here we propose to develop a new smaller, lighter, and self calibrating instrument, combining novel miniaturisation of Fourier Transform Spectrometry, and a new scientifically peer-reviewed (and published) approach to assessing DOC concentrations and character using CEH's unique water chemistry/UV-spectral database. Development will be taken to Task Readiness level 5, before we approach an industrial partner. We anticipate considerable demand from a potentially global water industrial and environmental scientific sectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The academic beneficiaries of the UV optimised microFTS range through the atmospheric sciences (such as pollution transport meteorologists and climate scientists) through to chemists and volcanologists. The instrument benefits any science group that operates spectrometers or has the requirement to analyse solid, liquid or gaseous phase spectra. The microFTS instrument is compact, rugged which makes the instrument suitable for environments where current Michelson FTIR spectrometers are not. This includes remote using the microFTS instrument for remote sensing from an Unmanned Ariel Vehicle for Global Information Sciences, Land use and agricultural monitoring. Or for in-situ monitoring in the laboratory or in field measurements. An additional advantage of the microFTS instrument is the increased temporal resolution. Using very high speed detectors (commercially available up to 10^-7 seconds), it is possible to probe the dynamical kinetics of chemical reactions.
The other areas addressed by this technology include:
- Pharmaceutical. In line analysis of drugs within the production of drugs
- Chemical processing sensors. For example in situ on-line measurements of chemical processes used in large scale pharmaceutical production plants.
- Medical diagnosis such as testing for diabetes through breath analysis.
- Multi-object spectroscopy systems for ground and space based astronomy.
It is recognised that the different groups (both science and industry), respond to different stimuli, therefore to maximise the knowledge transfer, each shall be targeted in different ways. The engagement with the Science Community shall be through the routes of publishing in scientific journals (Applied Optics, SPIE etc.) and presenting the results of the work at relevant science conferences (American Meteorological Society, European Geophysical Union etc.). However, the microFTS instrument will be of particular interest to certain science groups, these will be identified and shall be approached to either form a direct collaboration or to see whether this technology could be applied to their work in a method that would be of interest to them. Routes to these different user groups shall be through the Universities Research Services and Innovations groups.
The engagement with the Industrial Community shall be through attending trade shows and publishing in trade magazines. There shall also be a direct liaison with relevant companies, in order that collaborations can be instigated for future field trials of the instrument. Finally, publicising the work on the internet, and using the STFC and RAL Space website, will automatically focus the communication with both science and industries that are interested in spectroscopy
Information regarding the output from this project will also be put on the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory newsletter, and bulletin board. The Innovations group will identify new users and potential applications through contacts with companies and other Innovation groups.
The impact of the success will be measured, in science terms, in the number of citations of published material. In industrial terms, the interest generated from any collaboration formed will be seen as a major success.
As the instrument concept has been granted a patent, there exists a route to commercialisation, either through spinning out the technology, or through licensing the intellectual property. The economic impact will be reflected in the improved quality of scientific instrumentation that the microFTS instrument would bring to the world spectroscopy market. It is unique in its technology, and therefore the UK would be advantageously placed to take advantage of the benefits to society and wealth generation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>105863</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>United Utilities Group PLC</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration With United Utilities</gtr:description><gtr:id>050B68FF-C111-45D5-9214-E59E6C0B7E40</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The United Utilities team contributed staff time, and attended a stakeholder workshop at which they contributed ideas towards the final design of the instrument.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important for the water industry for providing clean water. Also DOC may be found in other solutions such as in food or drink. Whisky and beer contain DOC as maltose and fruit sugars. So being able to cheaply and remotely measure these compounds will be important for a wide range of processes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Once our system has been developed beyond the prototype we envisage that the system could be used by industry and the general public.

It provides the same advantages over grating-based spectrometers that are common to Michelson FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) instrumentation, i.e. high spectral resolution and higher signal to noise ratio in comparison to grating based spectrometers, Crucially however, the microFTS has no moving components, the instrument is inherently stable and has a temporal advantage over current FTS instruments, since there is no need to scan a mirror to generate an interferogram. These stability and temporal advantages make the instrument particularly well suited for dynamic environments under high flow. 
The static optical configuration is arranged such that the interferogram is dispersed spatially along a focal plane, where a detector array is positioned. In this configuration the interferogram is sampled at discrete locations determined by the architecture of the pixel elements within the detector array. The microFTS, shown in Figure 1, utilises a simple optical arrangement to split and then recombine light to form a complex modulated interference pattern (known as an interferogram). The frequency spectrum of the source radiation is obtained by applying a Fourier transform to the recorded interferogram.
During the CLASP project the microFTS was developed optically for the UV part of the spectrum, incorporating a UV enhanced back illuminated CCD, similar to the EHD imaging GMBH SciCam-UV device which operates from 120 to 1000nm. CEH provided a range of long-term monitoring field sites for field testing of prototypes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0197BEAB-27C7-4EF5-AB2A-4009EA3D4D73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Until the instrument noise is dealt with the system cannot be used in the field or lab as a technical system.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Micro - UV Vis FFTs system</gtr:title><gtr:type>Detection Devices</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Software for interpreting CCD data , removing pixel level noise, and delivering an absorbance spectra</gtr:description><gtr:id>1E284777-D875-46A9-A803-461FB1B7A811</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The software enable the development of the instrument system to date.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Software for interpreting CCD data and delivering a spectra</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FC4E7A59-CBB3-44EA-8FAE-9C83F3E95B92"><gtr:id>FC4E7A59-CBB3-44EA-8FAE-9C83F3E95B92</gtr:id><gtr:title>Field measurements of dissolved organic carbon in water using a new UV miniaturised Fourier Transform Spectrometer</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e76d5bdb4cd8309061c614cf1ee537a7"><gtr:id>e76d5bdb4cd8309061c614cf1ee537a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Scholefield P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/64C7FBDA-C39D-465C-B472-A08675B897EC"><gtr:id>64C7FBDA-C39D-465C-B472-A08675B897EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Demonstrating the detection and measurement of dissolved organic carbon in water using a new UV miniaturised Fourier Transform Spectrometer</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b2c46c8258c06e4949fd9181e5986ea9"><gtr:id>b2c46c8258c06e4949fd9181e5986ea9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hussain A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EFF7B849-2D19-4BCC-98C2-3DA73D031412"><gtr:id>EFF7B849-2D19-4BCC-98C2-3DA73D031412</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contrasting UV-Vis Spectra of Terrestrial and Algal Derived Dissolved Organic Matter.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e5b80b949f8f34185f46cfdd5f83db87"><gtr:id>e5b80b949f8f34185f46cfdd5f83db87</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adams J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FC262808-AAAA-4459-B573-66B26B2C5872"><gtr:id>FC262808-AAAA-4459-B573-66B26B2C5872</gtr:id><gtr:title>Development of a UV Miniaturised Fourier Transform Spectrometer (MicroFTS) for the Detection of Dissolved Organic Carbon in Water</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e76d5bdb4cd8309061c614cf1ee537a7"><gtr:id>e76d5bdb4cd8309061c614cf1ee537a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Scholefield P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/K00672X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F78E4567-DD59-4364-9D1F-0A778996E941</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrumentation Eng. &amp; Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
