The central hypothesis we will test is the role of oxidative stress and inflammation as key processes connecting diet, peripheral tissues and brain development. Two isocaloric diets differing in Se content will be given to pregnant and lactating female rats and to their offspring till adulthood. The role of Se in supporting brain and behaviour development will be also assessed in presence of lead (Pb) an environmental stressor able to affect cognitive development that is a concern in some European countries. The project has been organized in 5 work packages aimed at dissecting the effects of the different diets on behavioural development, cognitive functions, hippocampal synaptic plasticity and peripheral and central inflammation, using. ex vivo and in vitro approaches and transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics/lipidomic, measurement of oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways in different target organs. The offspring of the two sexes at different ages will be separately considered to emphasize sex-differences in neurodevelopment. The experimental studies will be reinforced by the observation obtained from an ongoing EU human birth cohort where exposure to Pb, micronutrients, lifestyle have been measured in children in association with assessment of cognitive, language and motor development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The project aims to evaluate the specific role of selenium (Se) in relation to other nutrients and trace elements in favouring brain and behavioural plasticity.

The main impact of the research will be the elucidation of possible positive outcomes due to a balanced diet in terms of both optimal brain development and in protection under adverse environmental challenges. There is growing attention in Europe of the need to satisfy the nutritional requirements of infants and young children, and therefore the primary impact of the project will be to raise awareness of this public issue, and to communicate the new knowledge and disseminate the results of the research. Ultimately, this will have a positive impact on the health of infants and new children. Dissemination will be addressed inside the consortium through internal workshops and meetings. Outside the consortium the main aim is to ensure the results are accessible to the scientific world and to the general public. The usual routes will be followed: attendance and presentations at scientific conferences, workshops and seminars, dissemination through publications in peer-reviewed journals, and through en external project website. In addition, educational materials will be developed for professionals and students. The final project meeting will be held in Rome with participation of EU main regulatory authorities and potential stakeholders. Any IP arising from the project will be protected by the coordinating institutions, who will develop commercialization routes, if appropriate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20654</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N029860/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>4F7FE31F-D266-4FE9-9BAB-3D21E9B789BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.3  Nutrition and chemoprevention</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
