Its core theoretical contribution will be to understanding the relationships between attitudes and health-related behaviours, focussing particularly on how people evaluate their health system, their trust in doctors, clinics and hospitals, and their utilisation of preventive and curative health services.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Previous research in China has concentrated on the impact on utilisation of age and gender, incomes, insurance protection, distance to health service providers and perceived health care needs. But attitudes, including performance evaluations and trust, also can affect people's decisions about when and where to use health services. Indeed some qualitative studies in China have suggested that people are often critical of performance and that there is a crisis of trust in doctors and the health care system.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our project will be the first systematic study of these attitudes and how they influence utilisation, but we will also assess the implications of health-related attitudes for government support and legitimacy. Central to the project is close collaboration with the Research Centre on Contemporary China at Peking University to conduct focus groups and a nationally-representative social survey. The results will be of relevance to scholars, policy makers and businesses.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The non-academic beneficiaries of our research will be:
1. Practitioners and policy-makers in health policy and health system design and evaluation in China (e.g. Ministry of Health, National Development and Reform Commission where PI has strong contacts).
2. International organizations actively involved in supporting and evaluating China's health system reforms (and the achievement of Millennium Development Goals in China and other developing countries), such as the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), particularly their Beijing offices; United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) and WHO offices in Geneva.
3. UK/Scottish government and EU policy makers working on bilateral projects or engaging more widely with China. These include UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Departments for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and International Development (DfID) which now works closely with the World Bank in China.
4. Companies investing in Chinese markets for the private provision of health insurance, production of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and provision of hospital services (e.g. Synergy Health, whose CEO was part of a business delegation travelling with David Cameron to China in November 2010).
5. NGOs (charities and other third sector organizations) working to find ways to reduce unfairness in access to health care as well as to meet specific health care needs, for example of women, in developing countries.

Our research will benefit these users in the following ways:
1. Deepening and transforming understanding by scholars, practitioners and policy makers of the factors affecting health care utilization and other health-related behaviours in China. Our project has the potential to influence the course of international development and health care debates and policies through its insights on the relationships between attitudes and health-related behaviours.
2. Improving information for Chinese policy-makers and their domestic and international advisers in their current attempts to achieve the government's stated goals of providing basic health care for all and improving access. Our survey evidence on people's attitudes, values and preferences and their relationships with other socio-economic factors will inform health policy on many dimensions. It may help mobilize political support for carrying through health system reforms, improving regulation of health care delivery and insurance, and changing behaviour of service users and health professionals. Survey results and the insights gained through their detailed analysis have the capacity to influence policy agendas, change perceptions and attitudes, and influence the way issues are defined and framed and the values which are perceived to be at stake in health care reform.
3. Contributing to understanding of China and Chinese people's values and policy preferences as well as their support for government policies by UK government (FCO, BIS, DfID) and EU policy makers as well as wider civil society. 
4. Contribute to the UK economy by enhancing businesses' understanding of China's markets for health care and health insurance. The opportunities in China for health sector investment (by UK and EU firms) are growing and our project will produce valuable new information on health consumers' attitudes and preferences as well as levels of insurance, health-related behaviours and health care utilization.
5. Helping development NGOs and international governmental organizations active in China and other developing countries to identify strategic priorities in the health care field and understand the policy context of health care delivery.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>429637</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project workshop organised in Beijing, China</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>016284F7-391D-4BA9-B759-F0410F8484CB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>30 Chinese government health researchers and health policy advisers attended a project workshop that we organised in Beijing.

We have encountered a good deal of interest in our research, with participants in our stakeholder conference including representatives of UKTI, CBBC, and business people seeking to invest in China's health sector and benefit from China's health care market. Participants have said that our findings increased their understanding of China's health care system, the attitudes of its population (and potential as well as actual health care system users). As a result of our research we have been subsequently asked to speak at the China Investors' Club and have maintained exchanges with members of the UK business community working in China. While we cannot demonstrate any direct material effects of increased understanding, we hope that it will have helped both policy makers and business stakeholders to refine their market strategies and activities and thus benefit them going forward.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D50FFAE5-7245-4370-A67A-3B5948198CA7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>NEW DATA AND KNOWLEDGE
We conducted focus groups and then the first nationally representative survey of public attitudes toward the health care system in China, which generated a new publicly available dataset. The project resulted in new knowledge about Chinese people's trust, satisfaction and evaluations of providers' competence, convenience and ethical behaviour as well as their use of services. We held a workshop in Beijing, an academic conference and non-academic workshop in London, and produced and presented scholarly papers and briefings.

We found the Chinese public's trust in hospitals to be much higher than other researchers had expected. But we found trust in primary care providers to be low and strongly associated with higher hospital utilization, even for minor conditions such as headaches and colds. This strong association remained even when we controlled for income, insurance, convenience and other factors that have previously been found to influence utilization. 

We found the Chinese population to be surprisingly satisfied with the health care system, and satisfaction to be strongly associated with having adequate health insurance and a belief in personal responsibility for meeting health care costs. Satisfaction was negatively associated with utilization of services, using social media for news, perceptions of access to services as unequal, and perceptions of service providers as unethical. This leads to the important policy implication that the Chinese government needs to improve the level of health insurance coverage (so that it better helps people meet their medical expenses), make access more equitable and reduce unethical behaviour by health care providers if it wishes to increase satisfaction. 

While people say that the health care system and its reform is important to them, we did not find satisfaction with the health care system to be associated with support for the Chinese party-state.

NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS OPENED UP
We measured trust asking a direct question and using this measure established a strong association between trust and health-seeking behaviour. More research is now needed to understand trust (and distrust) - in both primary care providers and hospitals. Distrust in clinics is not simply accounted for by evaluations of staff skills competence (as suggested by previous research that neglected trust) and further research is needed to understand it better. 

We found the population to be more satisfied with the health care system than expected. Our cross-sectional survey was not able to fully establish the reasons for high levels of satisfaction that contrast with low evaluations of the system by health systems researchers. We have thus opened up questions about whether satisfaction tells us more about the trajectory of a health system than its absolute achievements. Further research might explore the effects of media reporting and of rapidly expanding social health insurance. 

NEW NETWORKS AND COLLABORATIONS
There has been a great deal of interest in our findings from other researchers and invitations to present papers and collaborate on further analysis and possible research projects with colleagues in the State Council's Development Research Centre in Beijing, the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in China, the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development in Geneva and the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies in Berlin.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope that other health services researchers and social scientists will use our very rich survey database. Not only are we placing that database in the UK Research Service archive, we have developed an online tool, soon to be available on the project website, that enables researchers to do preliminary analyses using our data. We hope this will encourage researchers to use our full dataset. 

We are also producing short briefing papers aimed at non-academic users who may be interested in our findings. These are linked to project publications and the project website.

Our findings on attitudes toward foreign health care providers and health insurance are of interest to UKTI and UK health sector (perhaps including pharmaceutical) businesses interested in investing in the Chinese health care market.

Our findings on evaluations, trust and satisfaction will be of interest to health systems researchers and they may wish to use our data for further analysis. 

Our findings on people's values in relation to health care and their support for and trust in government will be of interest to a wide range or academic and non-academic users with an interest in contemporary Chinese society, government and justice.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>23869683-10AF-4C86-8A7B-399A601C6991</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/petu</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The database is composed of the data collected in a nationally representative survey of the Chinese population conducted November 2012-January 2013.
