Broccoli is the most popular green vegetable consumed in the UK and is recognised as being rich in nutrients and an excellent source of vitamins and minerals. Broccoli and other Brassica vegetables also contain valuable compounds that have been shown to have a positive effect on human health. Green vegetables such as broccoli are a problem to suppliers and consumers because of their short shelf life, which is exhibited by yellowing and wilting. In addition, loss of valuable nutrients and flavour begin as soon as the crop is harvested and this quality loss may not necessarily be linked to any visible criteria. In this project we aim to address this problem, first by identifying genetic markers that will be useful to plant breeders to create an improved broccoli crop. Secondly, by a detailed analysis of the molecular changes taking place in the lines with differing shelf life characteristics which will allow us to understand the many events that are taking place. This will improve our knowledge of the control of these events and indicate more specific targets for future improvements. We have identified two lines of broccoli that show very different shelf life characteristics. These have been crossed to create a population that can be used to identify the chromosomal loci linked to useful quality attributes such as yellowing time or good nutrient content. Genetic markers linked to useful quality traits will be identified and these will assist in the breeding of improved broccoli lines. Syngenta, the industrial partner in this project, will use the genetic markers identified to introduce chromosomal regions linked to good quality into their elite breeding lines to create new, improved crop varieties. Rapid advances in molecular techniques have allowed plant scientists to obtain a holistic view of molecular changes that are occurring in plants, during development or in response to stress. We have been using such techniques in the study of Arabidopsis leaf senescence and have identified many genes and pathways that are involved in regulating the degradative events that occur in a leaf as it yellows. In this project, we extend this to the analysis of a practical problem, the examination of the molecular events that take place during post harvest senescence in a crop.. We have shown close similarities between broccoli floret senescence and Arabidopsis leaf senescence and we have significant prior knowledge and extensive genetic and molecular resources for broccoli that we can apply to the analysis. The close relationship of broccoli to Arabidopsis allows direct comparison with the data on gene expression and metabolite composition that is already available from Arabidopsis studies. The model plant Arabidopsis has been fully sequenced so we know where all the genes are in this organism. The sequence of brassica is ongoing and is likely to be completed in the lifetime of this project. This sequence information, together with the close similarities between Brassica and Arabidopsis, may allow us to identify likely candidate genes that control the traits that we are studying. This will be important for more targeted improvement approaches in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In this project we bring post genomic tools to the study of quality traits. Broccoli provides an exemplar for the integration of genetics, genomics and metabolomics in the analysis of a real life quality issue. A unique doubled haploid mapping population, generated from two broccoli parents that show very different times to yellowing after harvest, will be used to identify QTL linked to a number of quality traits such as yellowing, turgour loss and nutrient content and stability. Genetic makers linked to these quality traits will be identified for crop improvement purposes. The collaboration with Syngenta enables the delivery pipeline for genetic loci linked to valuable quality traits directly into a commercial Brassica breeding program and this will be initiated during the lifetime of the project. Syngenta broccoli breeders will utilise the results obtained in year 1 and 2 to initiate introgression of QTL of value into their elite breeding lines. The molecular component of the genetic variation in shelf life will be characterised by gene expression (microarray) and metabolome (sugars, lipids amino acids etc) analysis. In addition, levels of key nutrients such as vitamins, flavonoids and glucosinolates will be assessed both at harvest and following storage. This will result in a massively increased molecular understanding of the control of shelf life and nutrient quality in broccoli post harvest and any links between the two. This is key for providing a product with consistent high quality to the consumer and will be applicable to other brassica crops and other green vegetables. This detailed analysis, combining transcript and metabolite assessment, has not been previously carried out on senescing plant material and will be highly informative to fundamental plant senescence studies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>461473</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In this project, we used natural variation in lines of broccoli to identify genetic loci that control shelf life. We created a population of lines from a cross between two broccoli lines that show a very different time to yellowing in storage. These lines also show variation in vitamin C and glucosinolate levels (both valuable nutrients in this food crop). 



Together with project partners Syngenta Seeds, we have created a new genetic map for the population and have used this with shelf life assessments to pinpoint chromosomal loci that contain genes that are have an important role in maintaining greenness after harvest. We have also identified loci linked to high vitamin C levels and stability in storage, which are separate from the greenness loci. Genetic markers in these regions could now be applied to marker assisted breeding of broccoli crops with improved shelf life and nutrient value. With the rapid current advances in genome sequencing it will soon be possible to identify potential candidate genes underlying these regions which can be tested in future experiments.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The genetic loci identified have potential to be used to generate broccoli lines with improved shelf life. We now have information on the chromosomal locations of genes that affect shelf lfe in broccoli. Further work following on from this has also identified similar loci for yellowing of green leaves. Some of these may overlap with the ones controlling broccoli head yellowing. We are seeking further funding to follow this work up, to find the genes that control post harvest deterioration and investigate in a wider genetic background to find genes useful for crop improvement.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2DB2F05B-686C-48B6-8098-5F16FB1434C5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture/ Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9D6F0EE8-02E1-4003-972F-8CF6746728A9"><gtr:id>9D6F0EE8-02E1-4003-972F-8CF6746728A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>A new broccoli &amp;times; broccoli immortal mapping population and framework genetic map: tools for breeders and complex trait analysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>TAG.
