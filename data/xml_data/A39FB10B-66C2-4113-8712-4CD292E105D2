&lt;p>Economists have increasingly started to look at issues of growth, financial crises and globalisation using a long time series of data. Economic history is also very useful as a testing ground for current policy debates concerning the effects of immigration, technological change and government intervention in the economy.&amp;nbsp; In a series of conferences, we will invite presenters to explore and discuss these types of issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first conference will relate particularly to financial crises in history, the second to labor markets and immigration in historical perspective and the final conference will explore gender issues.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of this seminar series will be graduate students and early-career researchers working in the fields of economics, economic history and history. These groups of researchers do not usually have access to substantial travel funding and frequently are only able to attend conferences rather than participating fully by presenting their work and entering into discussion. Graduate students especially can gain invaluable experience which will aid them when they enter the job market at a later stage-- presenting and packaging your research is a large part of succeeding on the job market and these are the skills we will emphasise at our conferences.
It is also likely that relationships with non-academic researchers working in government departments or public policy think-tanks will develop from these seminars, as we will circulate the call for papers to these types of organisations as well-- including the Bank of England, RAND Europe and the government departments responsible for trade and development, the Home Office and the Treasury. We will also alert media outlets such as The Economist to our conference series and believe that the keynote addresses in particular will attract special attention.
By providing funding for senior researchers to come and present their work in our conference series, we are also partly compensating them for devoting their time to helping their junior colleagues and envisage that they will also benefit from the connections made and developed at the three conferences. We are bringing experts in each sub-field as keynote speakers which will then attract other UK and EU-based respected researchers and thus foster networking to further develop these themes and advance the frontier of knowledge in these topics.
Please see the Case for Support for a list of potential participants at each conference.
Another main benefit of the conference series is that it will increase the profile of economic history in the UK by attracting researchers from other countries and producing high quality meetings addressing questions of paramount interest to economic historians everywhere. 
The planned outputs of the conference series will help to ensure that the above impacts are achieved. The outputs include a revamped website for the FRESH group, which will allow participants to sign up as members of the organisation and to join our group on Facebook, thus facilitating networking beyond that which takes place at the conferences. The website will also provide information and advice regarding the job market and publishing and will list calls for papers from other relevant conferences. A new FRESH working paper series will be created to showcase the research presented at the conferences and to provide an ongoing venue for graduate students to publicise their work in progress. Finally, we plan to videotape the main presentations from each conference and post these online as a public good for all academics and non-academics interested in these lines of research. This will contribute to boosting the profile of our group and of economic history more generally within the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17630</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Historical Economics Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>EHES</gtr:description><gtr:id>95F3A88C-5507-48D4-84CD-D951C3078C50</gtr:id><gtr:impact>FRESH meetings are publicised by EHES through their website and meeting reports are published on their blog, http://positivecheck.blogspot.se.

The workshop sparked much discussion, especially due to gathering these experts in one place, and providing an opportunity to mix with young scholars.

One important impact was to provide feedback on John Turner's new book, Banking in Crisis, which has just been published in 2014. FRESH was acknowledged in the book for providing a forum for discussion on the preliminary ideas presented in the book. Other impacts included networking impacts, potential future collaborations and job market preparation for graduate students.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sdu.dk/en/ivoe/fresh</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EHES Graduate Student Support</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>European Historical Economics Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>55DE2BC8-618B-4314-AD8D-2451969A8613</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our funding was for a seminar group, not a research project, so this isn't very relevant for us.
