It will do so through a detailed study of a range of literary journals, differing widely in life-span, geographical location, political allegiance, and aesthetic interests. 
This project builds on the hypothesis that literary journals have always serviced new writing, introduced readers to new artistic movements across continents, engendered debate, disseminated ideas, and more importantly sought to challenge settled aesthetic and cultural assumptions. This project, however, will not only look at the ways in which Italian intellectuals and writers traditionally verbalised cultural discourses and aesthetic concerns in journals in order to establish or counter forms of cultural hegemony; it will also assess and describe the ways in which intellectual networks used (a) literary journals to create sites for discussion and dissemination of their aesthetic, literary, and political concerns to national and transnational audiences, (b) how they sought to disseminate these ideas through strategic alliances with commercial and institutional outlets, such as emerging or established publishing houses of the day, and (c) how intellectuals and writers used literary journals to map their new public identity and define their own space for public intervention.
Existing scholarship has never fully addressed the interconnections between journals as a fruitful way of establishing their role as a collective, rather than a single, enterprise in shaping cultural, political and aesthetic expressions within Italian society. Furthermore, the strategic alliances that some journals forged with established or emerging publishing firms has been consistently neglected, despite substantial records showing evidence of the impact of journals' patronage of foreign and Italian authors on publishers' catalogues. Through the examination of the intellectual networks sustaining the single journals over time, we will provide an analysis of the patterns of dissemination of literary practices and the role played by publishing firms in this, and also account for any significant shifts in political affiliations of important editors and contributors in the period under consideration.
The research will highlight and describe the conditions, mechanisms and circumstances that allowed some intellectuals and cultural organizers, who had either a marginal or significant role in the cultural landscape of the fascist regime, to maintain a presence or achieve prominence in the transition from the regime to the republic and beyond, through strategic alliances with journals and publishing firms. As a result, our research will emphasise the adaptability of the literary journal as a form, and will also highlight the centrality of its role for assessing the social and commercial dimension of post-war Italian literary exchange. This project intends to address this consistently under-investigated dimension of literary communication in post-war Italy in a variety of ways: through rigorously researched academic outputs (one joint-authored monograph, an edited collection and three articles); a database linking data on the select journals and publishers' catalogues and commercial correspondence; dissemination events where experts in different fields can compare research and forge new avenues of thinking (2 workshops); and engagement with the wider community (2 exhibitions of rare printed material).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the project is threefold and it relates to (1) the database (2) the research publications (3) the workshops and exhibitions
(1) The aim of the database is to link two datasets where detailed information on the single journals and on the selected publishing houses is made available for the first time in this format. Existing databases only offer searchable data on journals, while disregarding their relationship to publishing firms. The two interlinked datasets will instead offer valuable data on this vital relationship. The database will enable the international community of researchers to access from their home institutions information hitherto only available to those visiting archives. The database will constitute a unique search tool for academics, students and members of the public with an interest in publishing history. It will set an example for innovation, offer scope for improvement and further research to other existing databases on literary magazines and journals. 
(2) The listed research publications include a jointly authored monograph, an edited collection and three journal articles. The monograph will address a significant gap in periodical studies in Italy by charting for the first time the intellectual flows and commercial relationships between a number of literary journals and a series of established and niche publishers in Italy in a significant period of twentieth-century Italian history. The edited collection will address the transnational dimension of intellectual networks and establish fruitful connections across national boundaries between similar experiences of collective intellectual engagement. The collection will host significant contributions from high profile academics and therefore will constitute a valuable research tool on the topic. The three academic journal articles will further expand the dimension of the project by focussing on detailed and specific case studies. They will be placed in ERA A-rated journals in order to maximise the impact of the research on the academic community.
(3) The workshops are aimed at the listed academic beneficiaries but also at undergraduates in the disciplines of History, English and Modern Languages. The workshops will be hosted by two institutions with established and successful programmes for widening participation: the Museum of English Rural Life in Reading and the Rylands Library in Manchester. The two linked exhibitions will enhance the reach of the debates held in the workshops. They will illustrate with tangible historical documents the conflict between propaganda and foreign coverage and the role played by periodical publications during the war (Reading) and will contribute to the understanding of the role played by translators in the dissemination of foreign culture with the exhibition of documents relating to UK-based publishing houses dealing with Italian culture (Manchester).
Each workshop and exhibition will be widely advertised in the academic community and will have an immediate local impact also through established networks with secondary schools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>154471</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of Rare printed material @ Anthony Burgess Foundation in Manchester: Scripting the World (16-27  June 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>787BB946-C8AF-4BC9-90EB-F57F791A0A4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Great interest was generated in the editors' and contributors' letters exhibited.

During the lifetime of the project we analysed the textual and para-textual data of 14 journals and the select catalogues and correspondences of seven publishing houses. We have provided a theoretically-informed evaluation of the intellectual networks sustaining those journals and mapped how the collective identity of the affiliations changed over time when individuals moved to or established other sites of exchange. In this way, we have gathered and rigorously analysed substantial evidence detailing the national and international networks of intellectuals and creative writers interacting with the select journals and publishing houses, and mapped their operational scope in Italy and in select urban areas (Turin, Milan, Florence, Rome and Naples). Our analysis has been taxonomic and evaluative (at the level of the single journal) as well as diachronic and comparative (at the level of their national and transnational impact). In order to give visibility to the outreach activities in which individual operators engaged over the chosen timeframe, we have systematically interrogate seven publishers' archives. This scrutiny has provided the first detailed account of how certain operators promoted the cultural legitimacy of some aesthetic configurations which only then achieved full institutionalisation. In particular, this project has succeeded in producing highly original research on a number of interconnected areas. For instance, research conducted by P-I and RA has highlighted the role played by agents in the intellectual field located in Naples in the cultural reconstruction of Italy in the immediate post-war period. Research conducted on the Neapolitan intellectual network has produced evidence highlighting the changing aggregative role of important intellectuals such as Benedetto Croce, and a significant aesthetic and political discrepancy of views and practices within a number of journals that revolved around Croce and the Liberal salons in Naples, Rome, Turin and Milan. In addition to the original research produced on Naples and Croce (P-I Daniela La Penna and RA Mila Milani), the evidence gathered in archival visits and by cross-referencing the textual data of the select journals with private correspondences in publishers' archives points in the direction of a re-evaluation of the role played by key women intellectuals in the cultural field. In this sense, original research produced by Co-I Francesca Billiani on Anna Banti (editor of Paragone letteratura) and Marguerite Caetani (editor of Botteghe oscure) and by P-I Daniela La Penna on Elena Croce (editor of Spettatore italiano) throws new light of the leadership role played by key women in the intellectual field, but also on the ways in which these women aligned themselves to sources of financial and symbolic power in order to foster programmes of aesthetic and political intervention through journals and bolster their presence in dynamic intellectual fields. This gendered dimension of the project has given much-needed recognition to important agents in the intellectual field. In addition to these aspects, the project has also thrown new light on the hitherto under-investigated commercial side of journals' engagement with publishing institutions. Because of the connections they actively sought with certain key editors and their supporting intellectual and creative networks, some firms increased their visibility and prominence on the market. Such vital interdependence has been analysed for the first time. Another important dimension emerging from our evidence gathering, critical evaluation, and analysis has been the role played by the Communist Party's cultural strategy in the immediate post-war period. Research to date has consistently focused on single journals such as Rinascita and Politecnico. Research produced by the research team has highlighted a much more diffuse attempt led by the PCI at organizing cultural hegemony on the intellectual field through the patronization of a host of diverse journals. For instance, RA Mila Milani has highlighted the strategic relationship between the little-studied Communist journal Risorgimento with Einaudi, the Turin-based publishing house. Milani has demonstrated through careful interrogation of archival evidence that the demise of Risorgimento was strategically linked to the rise of Politecnico. Research produced by P-I La Penna, demonstrates instead the complex strategy of saturation of the market segment through the patronization of different journals operated by the Communist Party in order to achieve hegemony over the intellectual field. In essence, the PCI orchestrated a number of recruiting campaigns aimed at polarizing talent, creative energies, and at linking these forces through a network of short-lived journals that saturated the publishing field thus detracting visibility from other journals aligned to other political formations (esp. the Liberal coterie revolving around Benedetto Croce). Co-I Billiani has instead focused on the relationship between non-aligned journals such as Botteghe oscure and Paragone and the PCI's cultural commission, demonstrating how the easthetic programmes of these journals reacted to the intellectual network revolving around the PCI but also tried to establish dialogues and strategies of cooption aimed at communist intellectuals. These findings have been disseminated through workshops and conference panels as well as through a host of highly rigorous forthcoming research publications as detailed below. The listed research publications in the original application included a jointly authored monograph, an edited collection and three journal articles. The research team is happy to report the following positive developments. 1) P-I's forthcoming monograph (2018) will address a significant gap in periodical studies in Italy by charting for the first time the intellectual flows and commercial relationships between a number of literary journals and a series of established and niche publishers in Italy in a significant period of twentieth-century Italian history. P-I will focus on three interconnected urban areas in Italy (Naples, Rome, and Florence) and detail the role played by journals and publishers in these important cultural-geographical fields. P-I and Co-I will jointly author a short monograph addressing thematic clusters and methodological issues linked to the cross-fertilization between periodical studies and publishing history in the Italian context. In particular, focus will be placed on the modelling role played by a number of foreign journals and their impact on Italian journals, on one side, and on the specific Italian interpretation of the journal as a privileged site for cultural aggregation and political contestation. 2) The two planned workshops were held respectively in February and June 2014 in Reading and Manchester. These addressed the national connections (Reading) and the transnational dimension of the intellectual flows in the select journals (Manchester). The research team and the international network of associates supporting the project agreed on the need to publish at least three special issues arising from the workshops. The research team edited two special issues of A-rated journals such as Journal of Modern Italian Studies (21:1) and Modern Italy (21:2), which will be forthcoming in March-May 2016. Each issue will contain 6 articles (one article penned by each research team member, plus three original contributions from top researchers in the field of cultural history, literary history and publishing history). In 2018, the research team will edit a special issue of A-rated journal Italian Studies. Also this issue will contain one article authored by each member of the team plus three original contributions by renowned scholars. 3) The two linked exhibitions at MERL, Reading (February-June 2014) and the Anthony Burgess foundation in Manchester (June 2014) have enhanced the reach of the debates held in the two workshops. They have illustrated with tangible historical documents the conflict between propaganda and foreign coverage and the role played by periodical publications during the war (Reading) and the understanding of the transnational reach of Italian periodicals in the period under consideration (Manchester). Each workshop and exhibition was widely advertised in the academic and local communities. Successful efforts were made to publicize the events to established networks with local secondary schools. 4) Through the publication of these special issues and of P-I's monograph in 2018, and the dissemination activities including several guest lectures, invited keynote lectures and 3 specialised panels at major conferences such as the AAIS in Zurich (2 panels, May 2014) and the CAIS conference in Sorrento (May 2015), we believe we have maximized the opportunities for the dissemination of our findings to an international academic audience. We hope that the innovative methodology we have fine-tuned and the published outputs showcasing our findings will have a significant and lasting impact on Italian publishing history and Italian periodical studies. Furthermore, we hope that our work will bolster the academic dialogue on the need to reconfigure twentieth-century Italian literary history to incorporate the role played by lesser known agents and mediators. Our research outputs and dissemination activities have therefore contributed to consolidate a view of institutions and journals involved in the diffusion of literary production as primary agents in a socially interconnected endeavor, and privileged sites for a collective intellectual engagement.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings detailed above are likely to be discussed widely in a number of academic communities in the field of Italian cultural studies, publishing history, periodical studies in the post-war period. The findings highlight the need to shift the paradigm of literary inquiry from an author-based approach to a social-network approach to literary production and dissemination. In this sense, we hope that the research produced thanks to the AHRC support will enable a re-examination of the patterns of cultural aggregation, and recognize the role played by journals and publishing houses as primary sites of political and aesthetic dissemination in the intellectual field of post-war Italy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E2B66132-0C8B-4736-A8E8-CE85C7950D68</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Mapping Literaty space is a relational database whose aim is to link two datasets where detailed information on the single journals and on the selected publishing houses is made available for the first time in this format.
