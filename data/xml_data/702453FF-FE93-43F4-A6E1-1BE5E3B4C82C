&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>love&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>companionship&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>raising children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>There are also economic benefits to living together rather than living apart, for example the sharing of household public goods, division of labour, and risk-pooling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If single people anticipate the gains from marriage, then this may affect their savings decisions within a life-cycle model, as will the anticipation of divorce for a married couple. This issue has hardly been addressed in the literature.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research will ask:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How do the potential gains from marriage (or loss of gains on divorce) anticipated by forward looking agents, and the process by which decisions are made within the household, affect consumption and saving decisions across the entire life-cycle, particularly in comparison to the traditional life-cycle model?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How well can this model rationalise patterns in UK expenditure data?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What are the estimates of consumption economies of scale to marriage from this model when it is simulated on UK data?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>As this is a novel area of research, the initial focus will be on one life-stage transition: single to couple. The techniques developed will ultimately be applicable to other transitions.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although this is an academic piece of research, its output will be of interest to those outside the academic arena. One output of the work will be an estimate of the economies of scale in consumption of singles relative to couples; that is an answer to the question 'how much more does a couple have to spend to be as well off as single person spending a certain amount?'. 

Although no one disputes that there are material gains from marriage, there is no consensus on how large these gains are, and whether they are relatively larger for, say wealthy people than for poor people - this, of course, is because we never observe individual consumptions in data on many-person households. However some estimate of the gains is used (or should be used) widely outside academia, particularly in public policy, but also in other areas. Examples include: setting pensions (or other government transfers) for couples relative to singles; to scale cross-country GDP comparisons (for example, around 36% of UK households are single-person whereas in Spain this figure is only around 15% - this distorts comparisons of material welfare based on per capita measures) and similarly to construct properly scaled within-country per-capita GDP measures over time or inequality measures encompassing different household compositions, and; payment for wrongful death to a surviving spouse.

Traditional estimates of economies of scale tend to rely on some ad-hoc identifying assumption (a well known example is to assume that different families who spend the same proportion of their budget on food are equally well off - known as Engel Scales) and/or be focused on the addition of children to a household. But, as described above, for many policy purposes it is relevant to know the economies of scale going from a one adult household to a two adult household. The estimates we provide should, therefore, be of interest to a non-academic audience, and they are also more theoretically grounded than some other methods.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80588</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Consumption and Marriage</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>25EC5F03-2506-4EA0-AE5E-EF50B3A736F3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented at Royal Holloway University Family Economics Workshop, a workshop bringing together researchers working in the field of family economics.

The academic impacts were, and will continue to be, achieved via seminars, the publication of a working paper and submission to a peer reviewed journal. Should the paper be accepted to a journal, the research should reach a wide audience.

One of the aims of this research was to quantify the economies of scale from living as a couple as compared to living in a single adult household. The scientific impact lies in the method that we used to identify this parameter and in the heterogeneity in other aspects of people's preferences that we found it necessary to account for to fit our data, as well as in the results.

In terms of economic or societal impact the impact would come largely from the results, since economies of scale are (or should be) used in many policy situations such as the setting of pensions for single people compared to couples. The IFS website, where all our research is freely available, is frequently accessed by a non-academic audience, including policy-makers and journalists for example.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0D06E7ED-935B-4807-B94A-FAADFCE2285A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EF82B1C4-09ED-4A7D-A121-7757BD03170F"><gtr:id>EF82B1C4-09ED-4A7D-A121-7757BD03170F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Marriage and consumption</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/15783d27dd75ca51d0341def5b95bef2"><gtr:id>15783d27dd75ca51d0341def5b95bef2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Laura Blow (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J005754/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FFA3A6C9-532B-4B83-B6F7-AAF3E63D34F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Stats., Comp. &amp; Methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
