The long-nineteenth century is the focus of this study as it was a period when Ireland evolved into a modern nation.\n\nThe fundamental contribution to be made by the study is to record and assess new knowledge on a range of cultural institutions where art was available and at a range of events which made the visual more accessible during the period. One of the outcomes of the research is to enlarge our understanding of how the visual arts contributed to the maintenance of the union between Britain and Ireland. Much recent art historical research has focussed on identifying a 'nationalistic' art in Ireland in the nineteenth century. This project intends to complicate that notion by showing how a greater variety of visual material was accessible in an urban centre such as Dublin.The key information that I would like to uncover is to suggest what kind of art was available at any particular time in the long nineteenth century, that is, if one visited Dublin in 1801, 1861 or 1901, what would one have been able to see? Taste was dictated by political realities, as much as by the talents of certain artists. In 1801, for example, huge public panoramas displaying imperial victories were popular attractions in Dublin; in the 1860s whole galleries devoted to soldiers who had won the Victoria Cross in the Crimea, India and elsewhere were on display at the Royal Hibernian Academy (the most prestigious display gallery in the city since 1826); by contrast, in 1901, exhibitions were being organised of indigenous artists and a distinctive 'Irish' art was being proclaimed. \n\nThe investigation demands the study of the institutions that permitted such displays. This book will offer accounts of institutional histories (the Royal Irish Academy, 1785, the National Gallery of Ireland, 1854, the National Museum of Ireland, 1877) and the large expositions held in various Irish cities in the second half of the nineteenth century through to Hugh Lane's establishment of a Modern Art Gallery in Dublin in 1908. Alternative forms of display beyond the exhibition room will also be explored, from the aforementioned panoramas to magic lantern displays. \n\nAn added dimension to this study is an international perspective. Research will include an analysis of Irish material exhibited in England and further afield in the USA. We need to know more about the creative diaspora and the continuous Irish presence within the British and the American nineteenth-century artistic experience. Initial work carried out for the highly successful National Portrait Gallery exhibition, Conquering England: Ireland in Victorian London (2005), has alerted me to the large numbers of Irish works exhibited in London exhibitions during the period. Equally, the appearance of Irish art and commercial goods at the numerous world expositions in Britain and the USA offer an intriguing counterbalance to the all too common dominant story of militant Irish nationalism. The model Irish village, for example, built in London's White City in 1908 was not a normal art venue but an exposition on Ireland composed of a purpose built round tower, thatched cottages, a replica of the high cross and as Annie Coombes has discussed, '150 colleens employed to populate the site.' Equally, the Irish Industrial Village erected over a decade earlier at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 consisted of such anomalies as a replica of Blarney Castle, the vigorous display of contemporary home crafts/industries by Irishwomen, all organised by a Scottish aristocrat and the vicereine of Ireland, Countess Aberdeen.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32497</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CE4E5B4C-9CA8-4B70-A519-CCC9AA95C330"><gtr:id>CE4E5B4C-9CA8-4B70-A519-CCC9AA95C330</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ireland on Show: Art, Union and Nationhood</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0077ccf8e20512c1c7f9b97397c314cb"><gtr:id>0077ccf8e20512c1c7f9b97397c314cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cullen, Fintan</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4094-3109-1</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F015496/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
