Engaging Children and the Public with Research on Animal and Infant Minds from Philosophy and Psychology</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/R00465X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>How do babies see the world? Do chimpanzees have a language? Does your cat love you? How do monkeys think about objects in their environment, and about each other? Can they really be said to think at all? The Rethinking Mind and Meaning project, funded as a part of the AHRC's Science in Culture theme, focused on understanding the minds of infants and animals from a scientific and philosophical perspective. This follow-on proposal aims to engage school pupils and underserved adults in prisons and the local community with this research, and thereby to build a critical understanding of science, including the ability to evaluate current research, and to build critical thinking skills applicable to many areas of work and life. 

Working closely with teachers and pupils in Fife and in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, we will develop materials that will enable primary teachers to present cutting-edge empirical research in psychology to their pupils, to evaluate how this research bears on traditional philosophical questions about the mind, and to begin to think about new methodologies for answering questions about the minds of infants and animals. There is considerable demand for activities in these areas; primary schools in Fife, in particular, have recently adopted a programme of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) teaching that integrates arts and culture into science teaching. Our interdisciplinary research, which uses empirical techniques to investigate traditional philosophical questions about the mind, is a perfect fit for these aims, and we will collaborate with the developers of Fife's STEAM curriculum to ensure that our materials meet the needs of teachers and pupils.

More generally, all of our activities will be collaboratively created with teachers and pupils, to ensure that they are useful in the classroom and genuinely engaging to a young audience. The result will include background information for teachers, activities tailored to pupils of different ages, and links to multimedia (such as videos of experiments). We will support teachers in the delivery of this material by a dedicated social media presence where they can ask questions (or pass on questions from their pupils), and by continuing professional development workshops throughout Scotland, focusing particularly on Highland and Island schools which may have limited access to University researchers due to their remote locations. And we will make the materials widely available to teachers by distributing them online through our website and in hard copy where there is demand.

We will also deliver lessons directly to adult audiences, notably including prisoners in HMPs Perth and Polmont, and to underserved audiences in the local community. We believe that by teaching cutting-edge philosophical and scientific research, we can build skills in thinking critically about science and its methods. How can science answer intuitive philosophical questions about the mind? What are scientific methods, and how can they be applied in particular cases? What do the results of scientific experiments really show? Critical thinking skills of this kind are crucial not only for thinking through current scientific controversies - for example, about climate change, GMO crops, or alternative medicine - but also, in this age of &amp;quot;fake news&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;alternative facts&amp;quot;, for full participation in politics and the public sphere.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary aim of this project is to engage primary school pupils and underserved adult audiences in cutting edge philosophical and psychological research about infant and animal minds. The main beneficiaries of the project will be:

1. Primary school pupils in Fife. Collaborating closely with teachers in Fife schools, including teachers at Thornton Primary who have developed resources for teaching STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) subjects that have been adopted by all 140 primary schools in Fife, we will develop activities and lesson plans that fit the STEAM curriculum. The interdisciplinary nature of our project makes it especially well suited to STEAM's emphasis on integrating arts and culture in science teaching, and by working with teachers and pupils we will be able to ensure wide adoption of our materials.

2. Primary school pupils in the Highlands and Islands. Collaborating with teachers from Highland schools, we will organize professional development workshops that will bring teachers at geographically isolated schools across Scotland up to speed on cutting edge research, and put them in a position to teach this material confidently. We will support teachers by providing opportunities to ask questions (or pass on questions from their pupils) on social media.

3. Underserved adult audiences, including prisoners at HMPs Perth and Polmont. Collaborating with the University of St Andrews's Cellblock Science programme, we will bring our research into prison learning centres. 
Because we will make the materials available online, we hope that other audiences - in Scotland, the UK, and worldwide -- may also be impacted.

The benefits of this engagement will go well beyond learning facts about our research.

1. Fife schools' STEAM resources focus on developing skills in formulating questions and developing investigations to answer them, in communication, and in the understanding, analysis, and evaluation of scientific research, as well as a general understanding of scientific methods, and of the role of arts, culture, and creativity in science. By presenting cutting edge research in which methodological difficulties and debates remain crucial, and the significance of various results remains controversial, we hope to develop these creative and critical skills, which we hope will generalize beyond the evaluation of science into many other areas of life.

2. By developing materials with teachers, and supporting them in the use of these materials, we will make possible pedagogical innovation; in particular we hope to build teachers' confidence in presenting recent research across science and the humanities.

At every stage of the project, we will obtain evidence to enable us to evaluate the success of our engagement. Early in the project, we will involve teachers and pupils in the development of our materials and activities. We will seek their feedback and will use it to revise our materials. As the project continues, we will use social media and collaboration with school officials in Fife and in the Highlands and Islands to get precise information about the number of schools using our materials, the number of pupils engaged, and how they are affected. 

More speculatively, we hope that engaging with our research will provoke audiences to rethink philosophy, science, and their own place in nature. The STEAM programme with which we are collaborating articulates a vision of science as driven by creativity, thereby creating innovations which drive the economy. Our research supports this vision; we see scientific investigations as having the potential to help answer intuitive, philosophical questions about the mind, and philosophy as having the potential to suggest new questions and new methodologies for scientists to investigate. Appreciating this research will give audiences a new perspective on how the human mind fits in to the natural world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>69026</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R00465X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>790AD28C-6380-4025-83C2-6881B93C4602</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal behaviour</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>143EF6F8-CF59-4D04-9EA7-40D70FC41177</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Mind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C6428B5-4A75-42D5-9D5B-5DF34F513B7E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science &amp; Maths, &amp; Math Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
