It will extend discussion of walking art as a medium with potential to interact with and inform a range of disciplinary perspectives in relation to notions of site, place, participation, mobility, communities, environment and histories. It seeks to build a community of practice - from peers within the realms of art and academe with an interest in walking as an artistic and interrogatory practice, to those communities who utilise walking in social and cultural forms (ramblers, strollers) as research (environmentalists, naturalists, archaeologists) and sport (mountaineers, speed-walkers) and merely as a mode of getting from A-B (commuters). 

In the last five to ten years walking has emerged and evolved as an art practice and medium that is used across the visual and performing arts. Conferences, symposia and other events that touch upon walking as a mode of art practice have brought walking artists and researchers together and continued to highlight the diverse practices, forms and methodologies that might be defined as walking art. New publications too have appeared that work to develop and extend this discourse. However it is still a very new field, and the research questions that the network seeks to ask, alongside the aim to connect practitioners and researchers across disciplines, will serve to develop further understanding and exchange.

By engaging participants from a range of disciplines the network seeks to rapidly progress knowledge and understanding of the range and nature of practices using walking, and the theoretical standpoints that inform them. Cross fertilisation of ideas, and transfer of knowledge in this area is envisaged on a number of levels - through the sharing of research methods, approaches and forms of working.

In practical terms the network will encompass academia and practice, from a broad range of visual and performing arts areas. A series of meetings (4) over a period of 24 months will be held. A core research group of 12-15 participants will be formed by invitation. An additional open call for participants will be made, using academic and practice-focused channels, for walking art 'laboratories' to be held alongside the 'Sideways' festival of walking in Belgium in August 2012, and alongside the Lincolnshire Wolds Walking Festival in June 2013. An online presence for the network will act as a repository for documentation of the workshop series as well as providing for remote participation both nationally and internationally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research will extend well beyond the core research group of academics. The multi-disciplinary scope of this group provides a strong foundation for maximising the impact potential of the research - as each member undertakes to communicate its findings within their disciplinary circle.The inclusion in the research group of established practitioners, members of cultural and non-governmental organisations additionally provides for impact outside of academia into arts practice, and applied areas such as environment, mobility, recreation and landscape development.

The project partner, Trage Wegen, provides the key route to impact outside of the arts and academia. Their expertise and experience in working with activists, communities and policy makers ensures that knowledge transfer from both theoretical and practice based standpoints can be maximised - for example through the transfer of innovative dialogic research methods and collaborative working models. The co-location of the first network meeting at the 'Sideways' festival in Belgium (organised by Trage Wegen) provides opportunity for immediate knowledge transfer, as well as potential for making connections that will lead to future collaboration and relationships both during and beyond the life of the network.

The co-location of the third network meeting at the Lincolnshire Wolds Walking Festival, additionally provides opportunity for knowledge transfer. This is an annual event co-sponsored by local authorities, DEFRA, the ramblers and Sustrans, with a focus on the rural economy, sustainability and walking for health, the festival has not previously included a walking art component. Conan Lawrence, network member and lecturer at the University of Lincoln, is working closely with the festival's organisers to develop this connection and to ensure that potential impact is fully exploited.

The Principal Investigator and Co-Investigator, alongside the core research group, bring existing relationships with a range of cultural institutions who offer routes to dissemination and dialogue with diverse communities. These are key to ensuring that the network's findings and outputs extend beyond the life of the scheduled meetings. 

Existing relationships with arts and cultural organisations that may benefit from this research include:

Camden Arts Centre, a public contemporary visual arts space in London with an established live art/performance strand.

Chelsea Theatre, London's 'live art' theatre, dedicated to commissioning, producing and presenting the freshest and most innovative artists, both nationally and internationally.

Hoxton Hall, an east London arts centre with a history of community-engaged, youth focused projects.

Plymouth Arts Centre, a visual arts centre with a reputation for its local and international contemporary art exhibitions.

A week-long programme ran at Somerset House, London as part of their Utopia 2016 festival, and a day-long programme ran at Forest Fringe in Edinburgh at part of the Edinburgh International festival.
 
&amp;quot;The invisibility of women in what appears as a canon of walking is conspicuous; where they are included, it is often as an 'exception' to an unstated norm, represented by a single chapter in a book or even a footnote.&amp;quot; - Heddon and Turner (2012) 'Walking Women: Shifting the Tales and Scales of Mobility' Contemporay Theatre Review, Vol. 22(2), 2012, p. 225
 
WALKING WOMEN asked - How do we re-write a canon? How do we re-balance the perception of art, artists, and the use of walking as a creative practice? Can we not only imagine a future in which gender bias and skewed vision is destroyed, but actively build the pathway there? Bringing together artists from across disciplines - theatre makers, writers, sculptors, film makers, poets, live artists and visual artists with academics, curators and cultural critics to discuss, present, create, record, broadcast and make public the work of WALKING WOMEN.This series of events acknowledges and celebrates their work, sharing practice through walking artworks, talks and discussions.
WALKING WOMEN created a space in which artists and creative practitioners could connect with one another and with new audiences for their work, generating debate, discussion and new knowledge, with the goal of raising the visibility of these practices.
Artist's walks and talks ran alongside a Wikipedia edit-a-thon of women walking artists, an open mic Pecha-Kucha, and special editions of LADA's Study Room and The Walking Library, featuring books by, about and related to walking women</gtr:description><gtr:id>03DF13E5-60F4-49FF-8369-C0B42316057A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 40 artists presented their work in the format of walks, talks, films and performances. Somerset House reported that the weekend of programming at the heart of WALKING WOMEN was the most animated of their year-long festival - and they are using it as a basis for reconsidering their approach to collaborative curation and event programming. 
As well as enabling networking amongst artists, an extensive new audience was reached with full house audiences for every event. Director of the Live Art Development Agency, Lois Keidan, commented that this work was essential - and that she would like to see the project extended with collaboration with national art galleries/institutions.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Walking Women</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk/whats-on/walking-women/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Trage Wegen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Trage Wegen</gtr:description><gtr:id>0D953F81-EBDE-47A8-BD47-82696836702C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs are listed under the entry that relates to this included in the 'events' section named 'walkie talkie too'.

Dr. G&amp;ouml;ze Saner is a lecturer in theatre at Goldsmiths University. G&amp;ouml;ze has trained with The New Winds, led by Iben Nagel Rasmussen of Odin Teatret, with Claudia Contin and Ferrucio Merisi on commedia dell'arte, with Enzo Cozzi on leather mask-making and with Alison Hodge on her clown. Since 2005, she has been working with The Quick and the Dead led by Alison Hodge. In 2005, G&amp;ouml;ze founded her company, cafila aeterna, www.cafila-aeterna.com. Currently, the company is working on developing a traveling performance in response to the tortoise as archetype. Dr. Saner will be discussing her project Migrant Steps, a community theatre project that engages migrant women living in the UK and Europe. Starting from the figure of a travelling tortoise and combining methodologies such as psychogeography, performance art, physical theatre and autobiographical writing, the project aims to transform participants' relationship with the urban environment.

Marion Vargaftig is a founder of Manifesta, which aims to facilitate creative expression of marginalised and youth voices (including migrants) using arts and culture and film-making, in order to express young people's ideas and perspectives, and put them 'centre stage' - using traditional exhibition sites as well as more unusual public spaces to reach the widest possible audience mix, and to provoke refreshed discourses on key current social and cultural affairs. She will discuss her project In My Footsteps, which used walking to create interactions between people and place - combining local history and heritage with communal culture and personal identity. First piloted in London's East End - Whitechapel, Limehouse and Poplar - it has engaged local residents, young and old, in living-heritage activities: unearthing, highlighting and celebrating fresh 'takes' on particular places that matter to them.

Dr. Georgie Wemyss is Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Research on Migration, Refugees and Belonging. She is currently working on the EUBorderscapes project, investigating the evolving concepts of state borders in Europe. Her interest in the everyday processes of bordering grew out of her D.Phil ethnographic research about Britishness and belonging together with insights gained from 20 years teaching social anthropology to adults returning to education in East London. Previously she worked as a youth worker in Tower Hamlets and lived in India and Bangladesh where she studied at the Bangla Academy.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.walkingartistsnetwork.org/step-by-step-seminar-series/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Footwork Walk Hayle</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28DF669F-C91D-48E4-BF6A-8FFFB343AC68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A group of 16 researchers, PhD students and artists walked a series of routes in Hayle, Cornwall over the course of 2 days.

The exhibition co-delivered in 2014 with AirSpace Gallery in Stoke on Trent (UK) 'The Walking Encyclopedia' was conceived of during this workshop through the meeting of the gallery directors with the WAN/Footwork PI and advisory group. Additionally artists participating in the wider 'Sideways' programme networked with cultural stakeholders resulting in e.g. the commissioning of new works - 'Orquestina de Pigmeos' were commissioned to create new site specific promenade performance work in Falmouth in 2013 http://www.penrynartsfestival.co.uk/#!orquestina-de-pigmeos/c19ym</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://walkietalkietoo.wordpress.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>UEL Undergraduate Research Internship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of East London</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7B30C59D-310A-4801-9CE7-B6C82A12CE25</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>One example of impact is the establishment of an annual walking festival 'Still Walking' by a participant in one of the network's meetings. He commissioned artists that he had met at the network event, and uses the network mailing list to promote the festival. The festival has now been running for 4 years and receives arts council funding. Audience figures for the 2015 festival were 300+ with 16 newly commissioned walks.
Additionally participants in the broader (web-based) network have reported that its discussion groups have created a sense of belonging and of community, a feeling that their practices are shared and understood by others. Particularly in the case of geographically remote practitioners this has been impactful in enabling them to connect, share their ideas, discuss work-in-progress, and take up opportunities to participate in person.
In 2016 I worked wit Somerset house to deliver a programme of events 'Walking Women' as part of their year-long Utopia festival. Using the network approach in engaging artists as speakers and in presenting their work generated the 'most animated' week of the year. Somerset House are now using this curatorial approach to consider how they might adapt their approach to generating public engagement with their events programme in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9AA2A4F0-7B75-4960-BC50-5CAAE96D037D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The routes to walking as a mode of art practice are many and varied. Practitioners from backgrounds such as painting, sculpture, theatre, dance and literature (to name a few) self identify as walking artists. Additionally, researchers and practitioners from a range of non-arts based areas, including geography, anthropology, philosophy, town planning and public health are increasingly interested in walking art practices and how they intersect with their work. 
Whilst the project's members directory has mapped this range and breadth of disciplinary identities within the field of walking art, it has also revealed that the scale (of people identifying as walking artists) is too great from a project on this scale to tackle. 
This opens some interesting questions for possible future study - which were articulated as part of the final network meeting in April 2016. 
These are divided into 3 key strands:
1. The diversity of forms and growth of interest in walking art practices
2. The regional particularities in walking (art)
3. The politics of walking (art).

Each of these was further expanded in our call for papers at the closing symposium:
1. The growth/ interest in walking art practices: Its visibility, breadth and range
What are the sensibilities and dynamics in art theory that are promoting walking's popularity?
How do these relate to wider cultural sensibilities and structures of feeling?
How are ideas of placed encounters with walking globally circulated and reproduced?
How are mobile and located technologies promoting new platforms and audiences for walking art practices?

2. Regional particularities in walking (art)
How does the act of walking take possession of landscape and/or articulate the identity of the walker with the place (and vice versa)?
How can we challenge ourselves as walkers in a passive landscape/backdrop: How do the animate and inanimate act upon one another?
How does the act of walking connect places?
How is regional identity communicated or marketed (nationally and internationally) through the appeal of walking?

3. The politics of walking (art)
Who is marginalized or left behind?
Who is walking? Who isn't walking?
Are the resistances of walking over-stated?
How does walking mobilise political action? 

We are currently working on an edited volume collecting together the papers from the symposium that addressed these questions, to be published by Triarchy Press in 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Members of the research group are currently working on funding proposals to further several lines of inquiry emerging from the network. For example Sacha Kagan and Cathy Turner are developing a project that looks in details at artists in India using walking in their practice. I am working with partners including Somerset House in London, and Forest Fringe in Edinburgh, along with the artist Amy Sharrocks, on a series of events that forefront the work of women walking artists - this is in collaboration with network member Prof. Dee Heddon.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B8051D4C-CEBA-45F6-96E6-C1C5461769F1</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.footworkwalk.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J013765/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A41F90B5-A81F-42AC-908A-49DB7154F85A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art Theory &amp; Aesthetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA5B898B-8204-4E59-97AB-DA2B10124EED</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; Theatre - Other</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB55E3F-FFEA-4BE8-9850-37FB373F4D31</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
