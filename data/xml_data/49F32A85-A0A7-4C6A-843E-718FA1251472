It is used increasingly within the social sciences. QCA reflects Ragin's assumption that much theorising in the social sciences concerns sets of cases, especially the causal properties of their characteristics, considered singly and in combination. Cases are treated as combinations of characteristics, with the latter described using sets. QCA has a form employing crisp sets where a case is either simply in or out of some set and a form employing fuzzy sets where a case can have partial membership in a set.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Given that, compared to more established methods, QCA is still in its early stages of development, there are various unresolved problems that need to be addressed. This project areas addresses these under three headings: sampling, technical problems (especially those arising when fuzzy set are employed) and the interpretation of QCA results. The project will undertake some mathematical-logical work, but also exploratory work with existing datasets.The latter work will serve as a test bed for the more abstract arguments developed, providing illustrative and educative case studies of the use of QCA.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from this research?
As noted in the section &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot;, given our focus on fundamental aspects of QCA, the main academic beneficiaries of our proposed work will be social scientists wishing to enhance their knowledge and understanding of QCA, especially potential users of the method. However, a broader range of academic staff will also benefit, in so far as the quality of research employing QCA - which will be read and used by those who do not use QCA themselves - should be improved as the results of our work are disseminated. It is also the case that configurational methods, of which QCA is a prime example, have much to offer those wishing to understand the complex causal processes that characterise the path from policy decisions to intended and/or unintended outcomes. For this reason, QCA is being used increasingly in policy relevant research. Policy makers who use academic research therefore will benefit from any increase in the quality of QCA-based work that our methodological work, once disseminated, facilitates.

How might they benefit from this research?
Relatively new methods such as QCA hold great promise, but because they have not yet been subjected to as much critical evaluation as have more established methods, it is necessary further to evaluate, explore and document their affordances and potential pitfalls in order that users do not fall into the trap of applying them mechanically, i.e. without proper awareness of specific threats to the validity of QCA-based work. Through our proposed research, social scientists using QCA in their own work will be able to make more informed decisions about how they can fruitfully investigate their research questions and about what limitations there might be with regard to conclusions they can draw. We will provide researchers with the means and the knowledge to achieve these outcomes through academic publications, conference presentations, a project website and associated online material, various workshops and a textbook aimed at advanced users of QCA.
Policymakers are interested in maximising the impact their policies are going to have, especially given limited resource availability. In order to achieve this, they need information not only on the average effects of policies but also on the effects on specific target groups, i.e. on types of recipients or consumers. Such knowledge will allow public money to be spent more efficiently. Policymakers also need to know how specific contexts, characterised by particular constellations of factors, mediate the impact of any policy. Otherwise, policies cannot be targeted at those who will benefit most. A case-based approach such as QCA, oriented to analysing the necessary and/or sufficient conditions for some outcome, is well suited to providing such knowledge to decision makers. Our proposed work with its focus on developing QCA, and on enabling researchers to use the method in more informed and valid ways, will contribute to the improvement and the suitability of the knowledge available to policy makers from academic research. One of our specific foci - on how cross-case and within-case analyses can be combined, using QCA, to facilitate the development of casual knowledge - should prove of particular value in this regard. These aspects of the proposed work will contribute to the design of more effective policy interventions.
In addition, policy makers, and their advisors, who perform their own analyses might be interested in adopting QCA as a method, given its suitability for analysing complex pathways to outcomes. Our proposed work would enable them to do so in a well-informed and critical way. To facilitate this, we intend, after the completion of our work, to offer training workshops and presentations on QCA especially designed for and targeted at interested policymakers. We will also explore the development of postgraduate modules specifically oriented to policy makers and practitioners</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>351526</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We argued in our proposal that, given the methodological nature of the planned work, its most immediate impact should be expected to be in the academic arena. We took the view, and still do, that as QCA and related methods become more popular - as they have - it is critically important that users do not fall into the trap of applying them mechanically, i.e. without proper awareness of specific threats to the validity of QCA-based work. This is especially important in cases where the users are likely to be either directly or indirectly informing policy-making, or working in industry or commerce. As it happened, around the time we began this work, a major new book on QCA was published: Schneider &amp;amp; Wagemann's (2012) Set Theoretic Methods for the Social Sciences. This makes bold claims to have established enhanced standards for good practice in undertaking set theoretic analyses. In assessing, as part of our project planning, the major outstanding issues in the debate on QCA, we came to believe that we needed to pay considerable attention to potential problems embedded in the advice for &amp;quot;enhanced best practice&amp;quot; being disseminated in this publication and others related to it. Our publications in Field Methods (2015) and Quality &amp;amp; Quantity (2016) aimed to make academics aware of these dangers. We believe these publications provide important advice, and warnings about pitfalls, for any users of QCA tempted to follow any &amp;quot;best practice&amp;quot; guidelines that have not yet been fully evaluated by the methodological community. 
We have also wanted to help provide some further ways forward for those who have been worried that QCA is unable to deal with problems of sampling and measurement error in the ways that conventional quantitative approaches can. Clearly, if results from QCA are to be acceptable to policy makers, then it needs to be shown how, when QCA is used to analyse large scale data, errors of both kinds can be addressed. Our paper in the International Journal of Social Research Methodology (2015) tackles this question, using examples from the National Child Development Study dataset. QCA has also been criticised by Lieberson and Goldthorpe, both eminent social scientists, for not being able to deal with the probabilistic processes and regularities that they believe characterise the social world. We are currently addressing this further problem and expect to make this new work public very soon. 
It is, of course, important, from the impact perspective, that our analyses of the serious problems characterising some of the advice available on &amp;quot;how to do&amp;quot; QCA, as well as our suggestions for how QCA can address the critiques offered by such scholars as Lieberson and Goldthorpe, become available to those using QCA in applied areas. For this reason, we aim, in later phases of our work, to disseminate our work outside of the purely methodological arena. We began this by reporting early versions of work later published in Quality &amp;amp; Quantity and IJSRM at the European Group of Organizational Studies (EGOS) annual meeting in 2014 at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University. We contributed to the sub-theme &amp;quot;The Challenge of Configuration: Bridging Perspectives and Methodologies&amp;quot;, giving papers of our own and acting as discussants for a number of other papers. The participants work in a variety of settings, mostly in schools of business and/or management studies, with contacts with industry, commerce and policy-making. Such colleagues are therefore well placed to use and disseminate our insights with respect to QCA and its challenges and opportunities in an applied context.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9E474A0B-CBF1-46A3-8A6C-A4B4756AE412</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key findings

2. To what extent were the award objectives met? If you can, briefly explain why any key objectives were not met. 
The projects had two related aims. One was to make a substantive contribution concerning outstanding analytic and interpretive problems arising in the application of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in the social sciences, the other was to deepen the UK's social science community's understanding of the potential of QCA, but also of pitfalls that can arise in its use, through the appropriate dissemination of our results. We will comment on our work addressing each of these aims in turn.
Concerning Aim 1, topics we noted in our funding application as examples of the issues to be addressed included the effects of sampling weights, sampling error and missing data on QCA results, calibration of sets, ways of measuring the degree of subsethood, and questions regarding the interpretation of results. The particular focus was on issues arising in the use of QCA with large n, though we did not restrict ourselves to this. However, we also noted that, given the rate of development of these methods, and the usual delay between writing the proposal and beginning the project itself, we would need to begin by reviewing recent advances in order to be able to carry out research at the frontiers of work in the field. The two main developments in this regard that were especially relevant to our plans were (i) the publication in 2012 by Schneider and Wagemann of a major textbook on set theoretic methods (entitled Set-Theoretic Methods for the Social Sciences. A Guide to Qualitative Comparative Analysis) and (ii) the increasing visibility of a set theoretic competitor for Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in the form of Baumgartner's (2009) Coincidence Analysis (CNA). Schneider and Wagemann (2012) developed what they termed enhanced versions of QCA, making strong claims that their arguments concerning the use of counterfactuals in the face of limited diversity and other matters provided a basis for going beyond current &amp;quot;best practice&amp;quot; in this field. We developed reservations about several of the claims made in their text (especially concerning (i) the use of necessity claims in their &amp;quot;enhanced standard analysis&amp;quot; and (ii) their neglect of the topic of sample and/or population weights in the development of some of their arguments). We decided, given the influence that their recommendations were likely to have on researchers using QCA in applied settings, that we should devote considerable time to an evaluation of their claims (published outputs 1, 3 and 4). 
Schneider and Wagemann also reiterated standard claims concerning the choice of threshold levels for assessing set inclusion (or subsethood) when employing QCA - a key aspect of determining whether a candidate causal configuration is or is not (quasi-)sufficient for some outcome. Since - as with the choice of a significance level in conventional approaches - the results of a set theoretic analysis (using either QCA or CNA) depend on the threshold chosen, the basis for this choice is a crucial issue for set theoretic researchers. We have come to believe that the discussion of criteria for making this choice needs to be related to more general questions concerning (i) the role of probabilistic processes in social life and (ii) the relative merits of a primary focus on regularities on the one hand or mechanisms on the other in the research for causal understanding. We have shown, using datasets generated from a mixture of known non-probabilistic and probabilistic processes, that the standard recommendations in the field concerning the choice of thresholds may need to be revised when it is thought that there are probabilistic processes at work (published output 5). We also argue here that some knowledge of generative mechanisms is required in order to make sensible non-arbitrary decisions concerning thresholds. In this context, we also addressed the issue of causal chains, and the problems QCA has in recognising them, raised by Baumgartner in his work (Baumgartner, 2009, Baumgartner and Epple, 2014), showing that probabilistic processes can cause problems not just for the standard recommendation concerning QCA but also for CNA as currently implemented in R. 
We have also explored ways of addressing the concern that researchers using QCA to establish regularities in the context of the large-n sampling of some population cannot assess the extent to which their findings are threatened by sampling and measurement error. We have employed simulation techniques here, both regarding measurement error and, via bootstrapping techniques, sampling error. This work is reported in published output number 2.
Finally, the topic of the interpretation of results is one that is common to all our publications arising from this award. Judgement has to be applied at all the stages of the research process. An example is when knowledge of generative mechanisms is used to make non-arbitrary decisions concerning the choice of thresholds, as mentioned above.
Lastly, we should mention internationally collaborative work that we started during the project but that is still to be completed. It has been suggested that a focus on latent classes and factors can be combined fruitfully with QCA (see e.g. Meuer and Rupietta's recent paper in Organizational Research Methods). We had previously considered the relation between cluster analysis and QCA (Cooper and Glaesser, 2011), and are now, with Vermunt and Cambr&amp;eacute;, exploring the relation between latent class analysis and QCA (see conference/workshop output number 12). 
This body of work, we believe, has successfully addressed our first aim. We now turn to our second aim - to deepen the social science community's understanding of the potential of QCA, but also of pitfalls that can arise in its use. It is in relation to this second aim that we have made decisions during the progress of the project that vary somewhat from our original plans. Our research associate, Dr Stephanie Thomson, left after the first 10 months of the award due to circumstances beyond our control, then Dr Glaesser, the PI, was on maternity leave for one year, in 2015. We had, inevitably to take account of these events. It was not possible to find a suitable replacement for Dr Thomson. We decided therefore to make more use of Professor's Cooper time. Taking account, alongside these staffing problems, of the increasing availability of web-based resources for QCA-users (see especially http://www.compasss.org/ and the site associated with Schneider and Wagemann's 2012 text) as well as several R-based packages for QCA and CNA, and the increasing availability of high quality training courses (see http://www.compasss.org/ for listings of these), we decided to concentrate on dissemination via publication in a variety of methodology journals (see published outputs) and via the COMPASSS working papers series. We have succeeded in publishing our findings widely (see published outputs). In addition, we have presented our work at various events where we thought it was likely, via networks, to reach QCA developers and users as quickly as possible (see section 1). In addition, we have taken up the opportunity to disseminate our work widely through writing a chapter for the 8th edition of a very widely used educational research methods textbook (see published output 6). We have also been invited to join the COMPASS Advisory Board. Since COMPASSS is the key professional organisation for QCA-users, this will offer further opportunities for dissemination to sociologists, political scientists, comparativists, etc.
