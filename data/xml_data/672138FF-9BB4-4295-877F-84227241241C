Their action escalated into a wider strike that focused on the right to join a trade union and was eventually defeated, but Grunwick is celebrated by the UK union movement as a victory for anti racism and anti discrimination. However, little is known about the lives and perspectives of the women either before or after their brush with trade unionism. And outside of the union movement, within the 'Asian' community, particularly among the young 'BrAsians' in our society (Sayyid 2006; Zavos 2006), this history of struggle and industrial militancy is largely unknown.

In 2005, another group of South Asian women found themselves the centre of an industrial dispute at Heathrow airport. In the 1990s, British Airways outsourced the preparation of in-flight meals to Gate Gourmet, resulting in deterioration in the workers' terms and conditions. In August 2005 the management brought in agency workers to replace workers who had been on their tea break, at which the workforce left the production line and assembled in the canteen in the presence of union shop stewards. Management designated this as unofficial strike action and dismissed them. Unlike the case of the Grunwick workers this dispute has been largely ignored by the wider media, the trade union movement, and the women's movement.

The original research project produced interesting accounts by the women involved of their lives, both before and after migration, of their work histories and struggles in pursuance of dignity and justice, some of which is being published in academic journal articles. The research findings challenge dominant constructions within media about South Asian women's passivity and domesticity, hence it is important that non-academic audiences are able to access accounts of these women's contributions to British labour politics. 

We have produced a website (www.strikingwomen/leeds.ac.uk) from the original project which captures the materials utilised in a six-month exhibition we mounted at the Women's Library (2009-10). The follow-on project aims to build on this by collaborating with South Asian women's groups to produce the following resources - a mobile exhibition, an interactive website for children, a learning resource for teachers, an illustrated book for children telling the story of the women involved and by participating in community events.

This project will allow us to celebrate and conserve the voices of these women of South Asian origin who have contributed to our industrial and political life. It will also contribute to the majority community a better understanding of the ways in which these - and all women - have to balance their working and domestic life, themes that resonate today in discussions of work life balance and human rights. The Follow-on project will also respond to the study commissioned by the Mayor of London in 2005 that urged &amp;quot;fuller engagement of BME communities in museums by making heritage collections relevant, vibrant and accessible to BME communities, by countering the present incomplete picture of Britain's BME communities' histories and contributions to Britain's economic, intellectual, artistic and scientific histories.&amp;quot; Providing access - both physically, and through the website, electronically - would make an important contribution to the construction of contemporary British national identity as a multi-cultural and multi-faith identity. There have been other initiatives which have sought to enhance minority, and specifically South Asian communities' access to their own cultural production (Holt 2002) but this has been limited to the cultural dimensions of diasporic identities. Our project would extend this into the political and industrial relations sphere.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this Follow-on project will include members of minority and majority communities including school children, teachers, museums, galleries, community organisations, workers organisations and unions, women's groups and charities. The specific groups which have offered to support the project and/or have sought the resources it aims to produce Southall Black Sisters (Middlesex), Asha Projects (London) and Saheli (Manchester), Bristol Women's Group, TUC Library Collections, the TUC Equalities and Human Rights Department as well as other community groups including the Gujarati Literary Academy, Brent. 

The research will contribute to the understanding, in both the South Asian community and in the wider society, of the significance of work for South Asian women and the contribution of these women to the wider struggles for dignity and justice at work. The project will contribute to a wider understanding within the whole of the population of the contribution of South Asian women to the economic and political life of the UK, and to the struggles for workers' rights. It will also contribute to the understanding of the history of Britain's diverse communities - in this case, of the complexities and difficulties faced by migrant communities trying to adjust to life in the UK as well as re-forging their identities. The making of the &amp;quot;BrAsian&amp;quot; communities in the UK is as much a story about the making of the whole British community - and a focus on the struggle for collective rights will enable minority and majority community to appreciate their shared history and politics.

The resources aimed at school children and teachers will enable them to access age appropriate material about the history of these struggles - and will have the potential to contribute to teaching in Politics, History, Citizenship education and to the Black History Month. The latter has been criticised for its focus on culture and identity, 'the steel bands, saris and samosas approach' (Dhaliwal and Patel, 2006:35-36) to understanding diversity, much to the exclusion of the material and political life, a critique that this project responds to.

These benefits will begin to be realised as soon as the resources are produced, and it is intended that resources they will be available for use long after the end of the project. To begin with, the project partner organisations will facilitate the utilisation of the resources and help publicise their availability through their networks and host the exhibition at their events. The PI will facilitate the use of the mobile exhibition and be available to talk at events where it is displayed, where possible. The web-based resources and the children's book will also be resources that will have longevity.

The PI will gain valuable skills in translating academic findings into accessible formats for non-academic audiences, including writing for children and will be able to utilise these skills to disseminate future research to wider audiences.

As a result, and over 500 people in total have attended these events which have included a presentation, discussion, workshop. Events in schools have resulted in the website (URL below) being used to teach aspects of the national curriculum in key stages 3,4, and 5.

School teachers have utised the educational website based on this research to teach key stages 3, 4 and 5, and have reported that the resources benefitted their students; schools have utilised the comic accompanying the website as part of their teaching materials; the trade union (Communication Worker's union requested 50 copies of the comic which it is utilising for adult literacy classes for union members.

For example, Des Barrow, a geography teacher from Hackney, London, used the resources for a GCSE unit on the &amp;quot;Moving World&amp;quot;. He says that the story of these migrant communities can really hit home because the issues are still so relevant to modern events. 
 
&amp;quot;As a teacher in a school with a very diverse population, it's helpful to find resources that the students can directly relate to,&amp;quot; he adds. &amp;quot;With the proliferation of call centres and outsourcing, and as immigration from Eastern Europe and elsewhere brings in new workers, issues of migration and workers' rights are as important today as they were in previous times.&amp;quot;
