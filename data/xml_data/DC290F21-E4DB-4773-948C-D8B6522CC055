This project explored how comparisons of present-day and ancient crop choices can inform on risk management within agricultural strategies of small-scale settlements along the middle Nile valley. Interviews with Nubian farmers revealed dramatic, previously undocumented, shifts in crops grown in the hyper-arid region of northern Sudan since the mid-20th century. Traditional agricultural knowledge is rapidly disappearing with some information remembered only by elderly farmers. Several cereals and pulses that were the most important food crops grown by villagers until recent decades, but are now little used, are comparatively tolerant to aridity and heat. Their presence in the regional archaeobotanical record also reveals their long-term use, further suggesting their environmental suitability. 

The 'Learning from the past: Nubian traditional knowledge and agricultural resilience, crop choices and endangered cultural heritage' project aims to:
- Advocate the importance of using traditional agricultural knowledge to help create strategies for agricultural resilience within international development and broader agricultural research programmes. 
- To highlight the potential role of increasingly little used cereals and pulses as subsistence crops in marginal environments.
- To promote the way ethnobotanical and archaeobotanical approaches can contribute to the agricultural research and NGO sector in Sudan, the UK and internationally. 
- To preserve traditional Nubian agriculture knowledge that can be considered as endangered cultural heritage and simultaneously as practical knowledge relevant to future agricultural resilience.

These aims will be achieved through the creation of a booklet 'Changing Nubian agriculture and crops; the example of Ernetta Island' and the organisation of workshops to be held in the UK and Sudan with NGOs and agricultural researchers. 
The booklet will provide a new format for disseminating the project results to both existing and new audiences. The booklet will provide a novel and direct way to engage with and benefit local farming Nubian communities in the Abri/Ernetta region, 700km north of Khartoum, and aims to help preserve Nubian agricultural heritage and knowledge for future generations. Farmers also expressly requested the creation of such a booklet, and local participants will be consulted on the booklet content. Once printed, the booklet will be distributed in villages and aims to conserve these 'oral histories' and local ecological knowledge for future generations. The booklet will focus on details of traditional crops and cultivation, agricultural practices and foodstuffs and how these have been changing in recent decades. Associated material culture such as traditional kitchens and less tangible cultural heritage such the daily routines connected with older modes of agricultural practices will also be documented. A summary of the ancient history of crops grown in the region will be added to provide a long-term context to crops grown today and in the recent past. Preserving indigenous knowledge about local crops, cultivation and cuisine has implications for future food security through offering unique insights into local adaptive solutions. An interdisciplinary cross-sector workshop 'Traditional agricultural knowledge, 'forgotten' crops and agricultural resilience' held in London aims to further promote the way ethnobotanical and archaeobotanical approaches can contribute to the agricultural research and the NGO/NPO sector, using the booklet as a case study. Developing ways - and highlighting the importance - of conserving traditional agricultural knowledge is vital to managing present and future agricultural resilience to seasonal, annual and long-term climate variation and change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The 'Learning from the past: Nubian traditional knowledge and agricultural resilience, crop choices and endangered cultural heritage' project proposes new outputs for research completed during the 'Sustainability and subsistence systems in a changing Sudan' project. These impact activities seek to create innovative ways of engaging with and disseminating the project results to both existing and new audiences. This will be achieved through the creation of a booklet 'Changing Nubian agriculture and crops; the example of Ernetta Island', the organisation of a workshop with agricultural researchers in Sudan, and the organisation of a cross-sector workshop in the UK entitled 'Traditional agricultural knowledge, 'forgotten' crops and agricultural resilience'. The booklet will be made available on a new website for the project and workshop, within the British Museum (BM) website. 

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCHERS, POLICY ORGANISATIONS AND NGOs IN THE UK 
The workshop will include practitioners from NGOs/NPOs, policy and agricultural research institutions and aims to explore how cross-sector research can address questions surrounding future crops and food security. The Nubian study provides an example of how local ecological knowledge can provide insight into the value, role and cultivation of local food crops, and is relevant to other arid and semi-arid regions where any traditional practices still persist. Local information about changing agrobiodiversity, together with information about long-term regional crop histories, can add essential value and context to debates concerning future agricultural resilience.

AGRICULTURAL AND CULTURAL HERITAGE ORGANISATIONS IN SUDAN
The booklet provides a new means to distribute the results of the original project directly to a wider range of audiences in Sudan, including anthropological and heritage centres. A report generated as part of the original project was aimed at agricultural researchers. The new project will also build upon previous engagement with these agricultural audiences through the organisation of a workshop and using the booklet to highlight in more detail the valuable information that can be obtained from local agricultural knowledge, set within the long temporal framework provided by the archaeology of crops in the region. The booklet will be distributed to universities, agricultural institutions and cultural centres, including the University in Dongola, the Agricultural Research Centre in Dongola, the Kerma museum, the Sudan National Museum, the Ethnographic Museum in Khartoum, the University of Khartoum, the British Council, and the Faisal cultural centre. 
 
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN SUDAN TO PRESERVE TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL KNOWLEDGE
The booklet will provide the most direct means to distribute research findings to Nubian communities in northern Sudan. The booklet will be distributed in village meetings, schools, local government offices and directly to households. This will help maintain local knowledge of agrobiodiversity and especially about specific food crops that are being used less today but which were important until recently. The documentation of local 'oral agricultural histories' hopes to provide a record of Nubian agricultural heritage for future generations. Significantly, during a meeting with local farmers in my last field season in Sudan, the creation of such a booklet was requested. 

NUBIAN AUDIENCES IN THE UK
The booklet will also be distributed to Nubian audiences in the UK through an event in collaboration with the Sudanese Embassy and the Nubian Society. 

ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGIST AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS
The booklet and workshop will explore practical ways in which ethno- and archaeobotanical research can have cross-sector impact. 

THE GENERAL PUBLIC
The booklet and webpages can reach a wide range of audiences through the BM website which has 23 million page views a year.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78375</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R004536/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE63480E-6C03-439A-99F3-2BBCEC64D6A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econ, Pol &amp; Env Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
