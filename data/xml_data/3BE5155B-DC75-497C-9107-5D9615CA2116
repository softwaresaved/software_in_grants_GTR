Implicated in the construction of an emergent national identity, Gothic fictions functioned to define the British as civilised, rational, and progressive, in opposition to the 'foreign', associated with the barbaric, superstitious, and primitive. Over the past fifteen years, however, critics around the world have begun to locate their own nationally specific traditions of the strange and the supernatural and challenged such limited definitions of the term; there has been a growing sense of a less nationally circumscribed idea of a 'gothic' mode. At the same time as these alternate national gothic traditions have emerged, the effects of globalisation have led to the literature and film of different countries feeding off each other to produce new forms of gothic, forms which reveal the increasing cross-cultural dynamics of the past century. This network will bring together individuals from around the world with an interest in exploring what we are calling the 'global gothic' on both these levels: the national and the cross-cultural.\n\nWe will be considering a wide variety of gothic forms, primarily literature and film, but also art, music, dance, gothic subcultures, and the new forms of gothic that have emerged as the result of technological advances. There will be two main symposia, one on the individual national traditions, the other on cross-cultural gothic forms, both with designated postgraduate sessions. In addition, there will be a symposium particularly directed at postgraduates, focusing on the effects of technology and new media on global gothic. There will also be a long weekend of global gothic cinema, with screenings interspersed with talks from specialists. Finally, there will be an international conference to further showcase the work of the group and involve the wider community of scholars.\n\nOur main aim is to establish a network of collaborations between international scholars that will lead to further projects funded with the aid of various international Research Councils. In the broadest terms, we will identify new areas of research by bringing the national traditions into dialogue; promote a better understanding of cultural diversity and the workings of inter-cultural exchange; and contribute to an understanding of the impact of globalisation upon culture. More specifically, in terms of the individual national traditions, we will examine, and attempt to find reasons for, similarities and differences, consider how gothic functions in the different countries in terms, for example, of producing local or national identities, and how the rise of an international audience for gothic impacts on translation and publication issues. Looking at cross-cultural forms of gothic, we will consider the effects of the dissolution of national boundaries, the degree to which the local is replaced by the western or resists being overwritten, and to which there is an exchange that leads to the production of new forms or the regeneration of old. We will examine the role played by technology in the creation and dissemination of a global gothic.\n\nThe network will be based at the University of Stirling where there is a thriving gothic research community. This has developed from our taught Gothic MLitt - one of only two in the world - The Gothic Imagination, and the numerous postgraduates who stay, or come from other institutions, to do PhDs on the gothic. The principal investigator, Byron, is director of The Gothic Imagination, a member of the executive for the International Gothic Association and a past secretary of the association. The activities will be overseen by an advisory group of specialists, and a website will facilitate communication between network members and encourage involvement from a wider public audience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49461</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F012519/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>470B20F0-5FD1-4AA6-8809-5E2780CBDB18</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
