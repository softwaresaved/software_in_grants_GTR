As a child, she had lived a life of luxury, being educated alongside the children of King Philip II In the royal convent of the Descalzas Reoles. When she came of age, she found herself drawn to a religious life, but railed against the then dominant cultural model for religious females: the Council of Trent along with St Teresa of Avila had advocated strict enclosure as the only acceptable way of life for religious females. With the help of the Jesuits, Luisa attempted to create an alternative lifestyle where females would live as an order or congregation yet remaining active in the world. She and her companions first set up home in the calle Toledo in Madrid, and her earliest letters date from this period. Later she lived next to the English College in Valladolid, where she became even more determined to become a missionary in England, even at the risk of martyrdom. She arrived at Dover in May 1605 and made her way to London. Till her death eight years later at the very end of 1613, she secretly ministered to the capital's Catholic families, visited priests in Newgate Gaol, the Clink, and the capital's other prisons before recovering their bodies after they were hung, drawn, and quartered. 

By translating Luisa's letters. Interested members of the public as well as scholars who are not Spanish-language experts will be able to learn about her struggle to find a new way of living - as she herself called it - that would enable women to lead an ordered religious life without entering an enclosed nunnery or even getting married. Of her 178 letters, 150 document in amazing detail her secret life In London and her constant efforts to remain one step ahead of King James's agents. Since Luisa needed to justify her move to Protestant England to a sceptical audience back home In Catholic Spain, as well as to keep up a constant supply of funding, she used her letters to explain not just how difficult life was for English Catholics but also to explain how hard It was to be poor in England. She documents the high cost of living in London, the difficulty in obtaining fresh food, as well as the expense of bleedings and other medical treatments. Her descriptions of her visits to Newgate Prison or the Clink to visit Catholic priests and her accounts of their executions are vivid portrayals of life in early-modern London. Hitherto only available in colloquial Golden-Age Spanish, her letters are a unique personal record of life in early modern Britain's underground Catholic community as well as a record of an attempt to move out from under the shadow of St Teresa of Avila. 

In additional to providing a readable translation of Luisa's letters, the project will also enable a student to complete a doctoral thesis on Luisa's other types of writing, including spiritual essays and in particular her many religious poems, as well as her autobiographical account of her early life. Her poetry reveals how deeply she was drown towards a life of service but also her frustration when she was first told how she must choose between marriage and life as an enclosed nun. The poems also reveal the almost physical pain she suffered as she attempted to find her religious vocation. This raises questions about the relationship between the desire expressed in her non-epistolory writings for martyrdom and the detailed description she gives in her autobiography about the mortification of the flesh to which she was subjected to within her family during her early adolescent years. Furthermore, the student will consider frankly uncomfortable questions about whether these were literary tropes, taken from medieval saints' lives, or whether they are actual indications of child-abuse and a desire for self-annihilation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>301892</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Newspaper reports, radio (UK &amp;amp; Ireland)</gtr:description><gtr:id>D467DD9D-2FAE-4FF1-B3C2-78DD255E00F3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The variety of life-experiences available to an elite female outside of, and unrestricted by, her normal domicle.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The production of English-language translations of Luisa&amp;acute;s Letters has already proven a much used tool for scholars in various disciplines.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8059F513-A384-4A09-B3AF-AC121EAE433B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1DB861DB-24F4-41BB-99FF-CAB2F02F503E"><gtr:id>1DB861DB-24F4-41BB-99FF-CAB2F02F503E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The She-Apostle: the extraordinary life and death of luisa de carvajal</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/83a4e21aa144273531ca1747ae408b45"><gtr:id>83a4e21aa144273531ca1747ae408b45</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>REDWORTH G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-19-957122-2</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A3A6536E-D15D-470A-B922-6968018EA609"><gtr:id>A3A6536E-D15D-470A-B922-6968018EA609</gtr:id><gtr:title>A New Companion to Hispanic Mysticism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/89a77ce263bc4054deb32ce52577930e"><gtr:id>89a77ce263bc4054deb32ce52577930e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Redworth G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9789004183506</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3540D8A0-2DED-4B7B-B4C7-2CD76E532E12"><gtr:id>3540D8A0-2DED-4B7B-B4C7-2CD76E532E12</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Letters of Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/83a4e21aa144273531ca1747ae408b45"><gtr:id>83a4e21aa144273531ca1747ae408b45</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>REDWORTH G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978 1 84893 218 0</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E509800/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>67D06C0B-53E4-47FE-8186-CBCE56A1271E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9EFA3E9E-2186-4589-A542-814A214E3D57</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic, Portguese &amp; Latin</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
