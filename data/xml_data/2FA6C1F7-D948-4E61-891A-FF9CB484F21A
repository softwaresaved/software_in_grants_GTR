For example, 5G is aiming to deliver 1Gb/s data transfer speed (more for local radio networks), 10 times more than current 4G wireless communication systems. The deployment of small cells solutions working with signals in the millimetre-wave frequency bands is a strong candidate and significant funding and research work are currently taking place. The hardware required to deliver these data rates has to handle signals that exhibit more than 1GHz bandwidth. This hardware consists of transmission and reception analogue architectures based on semiconductor components. In the presence of wideband signals, nonlinear behaviour is exhibited by these semiconductor components which results in corruption of the data and an increase of up to five times in the signal bandwidth. Therefore, linear transmission and reception of signals is essential for reliable communications to occur. Moreover, reducing the power consumption of wireless communication infrastructure goes far beyond the reduction of the deployment and running costs of wireless networks since small cell architecture deployment will massively increase the number of transceiver modules and hence the amount of energy they consume. Therefore it is vital to develop wireless transceiver architecture that is linear, efficient and over wider bandwidths than today, otherwise the deployment of future wireless communication systems is going to face massive sustainability and even feasibility problems. 
This research project will explore new solutions to enable wireless transmitters exploitation in the presence of wideband signals to sustain the ever growing need for higher data rates capabilities in wireless communications. The new solutions will be in form of new instrumentation architectures that outperform current commercial products, new characterisation procedures and signal processing algorithms that enable wideband transmitters operation in a linear and efficient manner.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact on industry
The research proposal will deliver unconventional solutions to dramatically extend life span of current instruments and push microwave instrumentation boundaries in terms of error detection. This will enable the consideration of new modulation schemes to maintain the growth in the capacity of wireless communication systems capacity. Beyond potential benefits to green communications, this research will propose flexible and adaptable solutions for not just current but also future wireless modulation schemes. We are telling the standards designers: &amp;quot;This is what we can do, go make the next generation of wireless communications please!&amp;quot;.
Achieving the objectives of this proposal will lead to fundamentally transform the mobile communications infrastructure architecture (more specifically the RF front-end) of base stations. In fact, if we succeed in proposing a transmitter that can deal with very wideband signals in an efficient manner (without consuming an excessive amount of power with the additional DSP resources), significant energy and cost savings will be achieved as, for example, there will no longer be a requirement for cooling systems for example. Moreover, because of the flexibility and generality of the proposed transmitter technology, it will be easily mapped to other wireless applications such as TV transmission and satellite communication.

Given the continued growth in wireless connectivity applications as witnessed in the build-up for 5G, the PI believes that this new RF capability will be most important for the UK, potentially attracting inward investment in the sector.

Impact on our Society 

This research proposal will lead to the development of sustainable wireless infrastructure. The transmitter side uses most of the energy consumed in a communication system, and the proposed solutions in this proposal aim for highly efficient transmitter architecture. This will lead to reduce the impact of future wireless communication systems on the environment by reducing the CO2 emissions. The massive expansion of the number of transmitters in future wireless communication systems with the associated energy consumption increase will benefit from the outcomes of this research to enable their sustainability.

Impact on People 

This project will result in highly trained people. The RA will benefit from the PI mentorship and experience in microwave instrumentation to build essential skills to continue his research career in the very hot research topic of future wireless communications. The PI will expand his expertise to gain new skills in IC design, this skill is very important to be able to contribute and propose solutions in terms of transmitter architectures operating in the millimetre wave frequency domain. A PhD student will also be trained during this project. He will be provided with valuable and unique set of measurement data to enable him to work on new types of nonlinear behavioural models.
CDT PhD candidate in the University of Bristol, and post- and under graduate students will also be informed with the outcomes of this research project. This will form the next yang generation of researchers and engineers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98519</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We need to analyse signals that need to be sent in the air in wireless communications to understand what happen to them and how wireless systems hardware affects them. This allows to take measure to ensure high quality wireless communications and in even in some cases avoid the failure of the communication link. Analysing signals requires expensive and high quality instruments, and for future wireless communication systems, we actually don't have instrument that are good enough to do it.
This research proposed to investigate an idea that accommodates the limitation of current instruments to enable them to perform signal analysis that is beyond their specification. We have succeeded to measure a high speed signal with a low speed digitiser using a stroboscopic approach of sampling.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have proved that the proposed algorithm works with current instruments. we need to implement a custom solution to make it closer to a product that can be expoited by wireless communication industrialists.
