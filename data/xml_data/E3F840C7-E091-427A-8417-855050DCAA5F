Assessing children's understanding of law as an empowering force in their lives.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M000443/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project seeks to find out how far children understand law as an empowering force in their day to day lives. There are many laws and international treaties that relate to children and in most of the contexts in which children find themselves; at home, at school or in public spaces. And these laws frame and constantly influence children's behaviour, and the behaviour of the children and adults around them. Researchers hope to gain an understanding of how far children are aware of these laws and perceive themselves to be protected and bolstered by them. 

An unusual and innovative feature of this study is the use of digital gaming as a means of gathering research data. Rather than interviewing the children and asking them directly about these issues, researchers will ask children to negotiate a variety of virtual challenges that are designed within a gaming format and made available to the children on tablet devices. Children will play one of these games in school, and another at home, with their parent or carer. This will enable researchers to find out the extent to which children demonstrate legal competence in their decision-making, as well as finding out how far the views of their adult carers serve to influence this. More generally, researchers hope to investigate how far factors such as socio-economic background influence the child's level of understanding in the law. Because of its rich cultural diversity, Leicester provides the ideal setting for a study of this kind. 

Researchers intend to work with approximately 1000 children aged 7-11 from a number of primary schools in Leicester. Children's views on the format and design of the games will be crucial in the games' development stage. A small number of these children will be involved from the outset of the project and will help to refine and finalise this and many other aspects of the research. 

The research findings will be written up in the form of academic journal articles and a report that will have significant implications for policy-makers charged with implementing and publicising to children and adults the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Researchers hope that their work will stimulate discourse and further research in this area and that it may serve to provide the foundations for the development of legal and educational reform in the UK and elsewhere.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are numerous beneficiaries from this research:

The general public: hearing news about the development and findings of this project will prompt public debate concerning the role of law in society and the notion of children as being empowered by law; so contributing to the development of a vibrant and fair society. 

Project participants: it is anticipated that in the short term, the interest of children and adults who engage in the research project and their school communities will be directly stimulated by participation in the project and by its findings. Longer term, it is hoped that participating in the project this will generate and perpetuate thinking about the issues raised in the research among the school communities involved. 

Policymakers: at UK level (the Office of the Children's Commissioner), at EU Level (the Council of Europe) and at international level (the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child) will be interested in the findings of this research, as it will provide findings based on scientifically robust data, which will indicate how successful these institutions have been in implementing and publicising to children and adults the provisions of the UNCRC.

Third sector organisations such as the National Children's Bureau, the NSPCC and UNICEF may be able to use the results of this research to lobby for changes to policy and legislation relating to children. They may be interested, for example, in the findings in relation to children's perception of the 'grey areas' of law. Awareness of gaps in children's knowledge or common misconceptions may feed into the research or information strategies of these organisations in the months that follow the publication of its results. Such organisations may, of course, wish to access the data generated by the project for the conduct of their own, related research. The research findings will also provide useful information to charity Law for Life; founders the new centre for public legal education in the UK. The findings in relation to parental involvement and impact on the children's decision-making will be of particular interest to them, since much of their work involves developing 'legal literacy' among adults through community based projects. 

Education Sector: it is anticipated that the findings of this research will prompt debate concerning the current practice of teaching citizenship in key stages 3 and 4, but not to younger children. The study includes the gathering of data that demonstrates how children, and children working with significant adults, think about and generate legally-relevant decisions, in the context of their every-day lives. It is specifically intended that these findings can provide the basis for establishing an educational resource for children, with the gaming element of the research providing one potential model for this. 

The PI and the co-investigator come from two distinct fields; law and computer science, and both will learn much about the other's area of expertise in the course of the project. Both seek to develop their ability to work with innovative and creative methodologies. The PI seeks to draw on the co-investigator's technical knowledge in assessing the remit of possible future developments in using digital resources for data capture. Since the PI and co-investigator will be working with a number of other parties: research partners/consultants, research assistants, children, parents/carers and teachers it is anticipated that both will develop team-working, people-management, communication and influencing skills in the course of the research, as well as time-management and financial-management skills; all of which could apply in other employment sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197944</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presenttaion at Government Research Seminar on the gamification of research</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>599258CF-C912-4B34-8437-1BF83817363A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation given on the gamification of research to assess children's understanding of law - mainly to government researchers; followed by an opportunity for the researchers to test out the game for themselves.

It is intended that this game will be openly available and accessible to all children and designed to be compatible with multiple UK and non-UK platforms. As such the research ultimately has the potential to empower and positively impact thousands of children both nationally and internationally. 

But in terms of impact related to the findings of this particular project, there are a number of areas emerging. 

Firstly, the findings from this study will contribute to the much-needed evidence base in the field of public legal education (PLE) as well as serving as a platform for the development and testing of further PLE interventions. As a consequence of leading the project, Dr Watkins has become a regular invitee to the newly established All Party Parliamentary Group for PLE; where she expects to present her findings later in 2017. 

The findings from the first phase of analysis indicate that children have a very strong concern for gender equality and a good degree of competence in dealing with consumer-related issues. However, it is clear that children have minimal awareness of children's rights. There is also a significant degree of uncertainty as to whether people (and especially the police) are allowed to hit children. These findings have been written up as discrete outputs, with two specifically intended to influence policy. The paper 'If you are 10, you go to prison: Children's Understanding of the Age of Criminal Responsibility' has been published in a Special Issue of the Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly. Lord Dholakia wrote the preface for this Special Issue. He is championing an Age of Criminal Responsibility Bill through the House of Lords; aiming to increase the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 12 years. The Bill had its 1st Reading in June 2016 and Lord Dholakia will be drawing on material from the Special Issue at the 2nd Reading stage (date to be announced). Pam Hibbert from the Standing Committee for Youth Justice (SCYJ) will also be drawing on the Special Issue as part of the SCYJ's campaigning for a fairer youth justice system. 

The paper 'Exploring children's understanding of law in their everyday lives' has been accepted by a leading generalist law journal Legal Studies (subject to minor revisions). As well as setting out the key findings, this paper emphasises the theoretical bases for the project and seeks to offer a robust platform from which to argue that children need to be re-conceptualised as legally-capable members of their communities. This is a controversial approach, intended to foster discussion and debate, and seeking ultimately to influence legal rules and practices that currently serve to limit the extent to which children's views are directly heard and taken into account in matters that affect them. 

In addition to this, in the early stages of the project Dr Watkins was contacted by the Chief Executive of the National Centre for Citizenship and the Law, education provider for Galleries of Justice Museum (GOJ). She has since made visits to the GOJ and carried out archival research to support and inform elements of their work. In Spring 2017 Dr Watkins will be meeting with the Learning and Access Manager at the GOJ to discuss how the findings from the project can inform the GOJ's plans to extend and improve their learning activities for primary school-aged children. 
 
As well its 'legal' implications, the project has significant potential to impact a broad range of social science activities, due to its successful development and use of gaming as a research tool. In February 2016 the researchteam accepted an invitation to present to a cross-government social researcher group on 'the gamification of research' hosted at the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills. As this indicates, gamification (the incorporating of elements of gaming into non-gaming contexts) is an area of growing interest and potential in both legal and non-legal research contexts. Dr Watkins presented on this theme again at the Social Research Association Annual Conference in 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D2D326C7-8125-4DDF-A49A-ECB96E42971B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>An innovative feature of this project has been the use of a digital game as a research tool, developed with children through participatory design methods. Feedback from the children who took part in the study has demonstrated that this is a highly successful way of motivating and engaging young research participants. 
All of the 634 children who were involved in the research played the game individually with tablets and headsets that we provided to them in their normal classroom setting. This individual approach enables children to immerse in the game worlds whilst being situated in a familiar setting where they felt comfortable and at ease. The use of touch-based tablet interface and the headset allows both quantitative and qualitative data to be collected from each child effectively as well as efficiently. 
There has been a wide range of interest in this new method from the research community. The research team has published academic papers on the game development and its implementation, as well as presenting to government researchers at a 'gamification of research' seminar.
From our analysis of the data gathered by the game, we have found out that children's perception of law as an empowering force in their lives varies across and within contexts. For example, in the context of school, children demonstrated a very strong concern for gender equality but also ranked themselves as possessing the least power to positively influence their environment. In the context of a shop, many children (64%) demonstrated awareness of their legal standing as a consumer but a significant number of children (30%) demonstrated confusion as to the relevance of civil or criminal law in this setting. 
There were a number of scenarios in the game where we anticipated that children might refer to rights; but across the whole study there were very few references to rights and no child made any reference to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). A particular concern of this study was to investigate children's understanding of their UNCRC Article 12 right to participation. We found that children demonstrated both willingness and capacity to express their views on issues concerning them, but that they did not expect to do so on a day to day basis. For example, very few children (8%) felt that they could themselves inform the council about broken play equipment. 
We found that children demonstrated a strong tendency to defer to adults when faced with legally-relevant problems and they considered that their own ability to deal with such issues would develop as they grow older. However, we also found that children were confused about the legal limits that apply to adults concerning the physical chastisement of children. 
In the course of this project, all members of the research team have developed expertise in utilising gaming as a research tool, as well as enhancing their skills in research design and data analysis. They have also established some valuable networks and potential future collaborations with both academic researchers and third-sector organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There has also been a wide range of interest in our new 'gamification of research' method. The research team has published papers explaining and evaluating aspects of the game development and implementation; and in February 2016 we accepted an invitation to present to a cross-government social researcher group on 'the gamification of research' hosted at the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills. As this indicates, gamification is an area of growing interest and potential in both legal and non-legal research contexts. 
For each of our partner schools, we have prepared a confidential report that provides information of the findings for the particular school, set against our general findings. This allows each school to identify areas of strength and areas for improvement. 
In terms of the application of the findings more generally, the PI has been in discussions with third-sector organisations such as the Citizenship Foundation to consider how the research might inform their practices and/or be developed into wider-scale project through collaboration in the future. She has also submitted a funding bid to the Legal Education Foundation to carry out secondary, multidimensional analysis of the project data, in collaboration with two academics from UCL Faculty of Laws.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A4EAC30D-F38D-4A68-8ED9-F838D2DE6885</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.le.ac.uk/licl</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4537BB48-81F5-413B-9A21-AD607F171A4E"><gtr:id>4537BB48-81F5-413B-9A21-AD607F171A4E</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Experiential Approach to the Design and Evaluation of a Gamified Research Tool for Law in Children's Lives</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7978d44beb7df8a0c5af7d26bb5fa682"><gtr:id>7978d44beb7df8a0c5af7d26bb5fa682</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Law, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/11F960BD-323C-479E-B257-2AA12ABB8D3F"><gtr:id>11F960BD-323C-479E-B257-2AA12ABB8D3F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Where do I stand?
