Statistics show that in the UK alone, more than 750,000 people are suffering from heart failure. Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement (hypertrophy) of the muscle tissue that makes up the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy develops in response to some factors, such as high blood pressure, that requires the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the walls of the chamber grow thicker, lose elasticity and eventually may fail to pump with as much force as a healthy heart.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes of cardiac shape and function has become a major objective in heart failure research. The goal of research for hypertrophy is to find out the way stopping or reversing its progression. Although anti-hypertension drugs can attenuate hypertrophy, the extent of reversing progression is not satisfactory. The molecular mechanisms behind reverse of the hypertrophy progression are not yet known. If we know the mechanisms how hypertrophy can be reversed and how the mechanisms are regulated, we would develop novel therapeutics to treat patients with heart failure. Theoretically, cardiac mass is determined by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation.
In the cell, we are equipped with an intracellular process called autophagy (literally 'self-eating'). Under starved conditions, autophagy wraps intracellular components in a double membrane and delivers it to an intracellular sac called the lysosome. Here, the material is ingested, digested and recycled, ready to be used again. We found that the heart in hypertension accumulates the debris, but autophagy clean-ups debris to protect the heart against hypertension. Autophagic activity has been known to be regulated by a protein called mTORC1. mTORC1 is a master regulator of cell growth by promoting protein synthesis and limiting autophagy. mTORC1 integrates 4 major signals, namely growth factors, energy status, oxygen and amino acids. One of the most important sensors for these signals is TSC1/2 complex. However, little is known how TSC1/2 complex regulates mTORC1 to determine cardiac mass. 
The purpose of this project is to determine whether autophagy reduces the size of the heart by eating the content of the heart cell. We will examine the level of autophagy after release of hypertension in wild-type mice. Then, using the same experimental conditions, we will examine alteration of size and function of the heart in mice, in which autophagy is inhibited. These will enable us to consolidate the evidence that autophagy plays an important role in the reverse of hypertrophy.
Once we are able to show the pathophysiological significance of autophagy during forward and reverse cardiac remodelling, it is fundamental to clarify the mechanisms regulating autophagy to find new therapies to prevent the heart against hemodynamic stress. We will examine the role of TSC1/2 in determining size of the heart by regulating autophagy during forward and reverse remodelling. We will examine the level of cardiac mass and function in the TSC2-deficient mice in response to the exposure of hypertension or the release of hypertension. We will examine the levels of protein degradation and synthesis in the heart and attempt to identify key molecules to determine the function of mTORC1. 
Thus, successful completion of this project will clearly demonstrate whether autophagy is responsible for reduction of hypertrophy. Furthermore, we would know how the TSC1/2 signalling pathways regulate autophagy to determine the cardiac mass during forward and reverse cardiac remodelling. These findings may lead to identification of target molecules for the development of treatment of heart failure.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We will examine the role of autophagy in reverse remodelling and the role of TSC1/2 to determine the size and nature of the heart in mTORC1 signalling. In this project, we will mainly use two different genetically modified animals, Atg5- and TSC2-deficient mice. Both are cardiac-specific deletion models generated by crossing floxed mice with cardiac-specific Cre transgenic mice. To confirm the involvement of mRNA translation and autophagy, the TSC2-deficient animals will be crossed with 4E-BP1 and Atg5-deficient animals, respectively. 
We will use three different stress models: i.e., pressure overload by means of transverse aortic constriction and angiotensin II infusion using by osmotic mini-pumps. LV function will be determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic measurement. The extent of hypertrophy will be examined by physiological measurement, histological analysis, and mRNA expression of marker genes using quantitative RT-PCR. Apoptosis is estimated by TUNEL staining. The level of necrosis will be evaluated by nuclear labelling with ligation of pfu generated probes. Intracellular signalling pathway will be examined by immunoblotting using specific antibodies and kinase assay.
At in vitro level, we shall isolate cardiomyocytes from 8 week-old mice and incubate them with H2O2 or isoproterenol to confirm the effect of gene deletion on cell death. Viability of the cells will be measured by Cell Titre Bleu assays. We will examine the signal transduction mechanisms in isolated cardiomyocytes from rat neonatal or mouse adult hearts using immunoblotting. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy will be estimated by measurement of cell surface area and immunohistochemical analysis. Cardiomyocyte contractile function will be measured using edge detection and Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye.
Protein translation activity will be evaluated by polysome assay. Autophagy levels will be examined by Western blot analysis and ultra-structural analysis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main and direct beneficiary of the knowledge from this project is expected to be the immediate
professional circle of the applicant in heart failure scientist both national and international. The results from this study will stimulate activity in the field and push the boundaries at the cutting-edge of science. They/we will use outputs from this research to increase our understanding of the biological nature of cardiac forward and reverse remodelling and their signalling pathways. The successful completion of this project will stimulate the international scientific community of heart failure research and contribute to the reputation of UK's science. Although the knowledge obtained in this project will not be applied directly to development of novel therapeutics for heart failure, we strongly believe that this project is one of the many steps to reach the ultimate goal to develop novel and efficient therapy for heart failure in the clinical arena. 
The priority to draw maximum benefit will be achieved by the dissemination of the knowledge gained in this project as far as possible. The methods of communication are important for the dissemination of the knowledge as well as for PhD students/post-doctoral fellows to have a good scientific training. This project will be published in international high-quality scientific journals. The results will be presented and explained at international scientific conferences/meetings as appropriate. This will also enable maximal dissemination of the knowledge among researchers. The staff engaged in this project will regularly attend scientific meetings to communicate with their immediate professional circle, which will give PhD students/post-doctoral fellows a good opportunity to follow up-to-date science and training in presentation/communication skills. Results produced are open to the public on our institute Homepage. The KCL has an active programme of public engagement in all research projects. 
This cutting-edge project might lead to some patentable intellectual property which may attract investment from industry. Thus we will liaise closely with intellectual property specialist at KCL Business to deal with intellectual property issues, licencing and commercialization of scientific exploitable results produced by its scientists. 
To confirm the progress of the study, to maintain the scientific quality, and to provide staff with training in presentation skills and critical examination of work, we will hold regular internal meetings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>400975</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/47803F9C-14DA-4BEB-89A1-E5D03B039F14"><gtr:id>47803F9C-14DA-4BEB-89A1-E5D03B039F14</gtr:id><gtr:title>Autophagy-mediated degradation is necessary for regression of cardiac hypertrophy during ventricular unloading.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1a904f22073d48355f0e72dfd2785911"><gtr:id>1a904f22073d48355f0e72dfd2785911</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Oyabu J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-291X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5C46E8FB-FF65-4B54-82B6-C9656BF7DCD5"><gtr:id>5C46E8FB-FF65-4B54-82B6-C9656BF7DCD5</gtr:id><gtr:title>mTOR Hyperactivation by Ablation of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 in the Mouse Heart Induces Cardiac Dysfunction with the Increased Number of Small Mitochondria Mediated through the Down-Regulation of Autophagy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/de11e1835afc64b8467ddd29b0c3b689"><gtr:id>de11e1835afc64b8467ddd29b0c3b689</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taneike M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K019031/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
