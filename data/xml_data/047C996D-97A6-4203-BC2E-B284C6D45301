Negotiated mitigation of landslide risks in informal settlements in Medellin</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/P015557/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Urbanisation continues to drive the growth of informal settlements on land exposed to hazards, increasing risk particularly among low-income populations, and heightening the need to improve the resilience of such communities. Informal settlements growing up steep hillsides and ravines are particularly exposed to landslides, which are a major cause of death in developing countries. In order to reduce disasters, we need to anticipate these through managing risk. Many ways of managing landslide risk are known, ranging from building physical protection barriers to raising awareness to prepare communities. However, in developing countries these measures are often difficult to implement, not only because of lack of resources but also due to complex social, economic, political and institutional reasons. 

This project aims to explore the scope for, and acceptability of, landslide risk-reducing strategies for informal settlements from the community and state perspectives; to understand the barriers to landslide risk-reducing strategies; and identify politically and practically viable approaches to landslide risk-reducing strategies within a wider and more complex context of social and physical risk.

We will explore these issues in the city of Medellin, Colombia, which has received many accolades for its urban planning and design and has become a 'model' for cities elsewhere. Despite the city's successes, informal settlement growth on land at risk of landslides continues to be a major problem due to its topography. Lessons learnt about landslide risk management in this city have the potential to be easily disseminated across the developing world.

In Medellin, despite the awareness of risk raised by key tragic landslides in its recent history and the arguments used by the City Administration to relocate parts of informal settlements based on geological studies, the residents of these areas resist relocation and protest that the local government has other motives. The project will work in NE Medellin, where there is a high concentration of 'at risk' settlements, and in particular in Comuna 8, where disagreements between community and public agencies are most pronounced.

Using focus groups and semi-structured interviews in Comuna 8, we will explore the perceptions of risk and related narratives within the community and among relevant public sector agencies, and the implications of such perceptions and narratives for the adoption of risk-mitigating strategies and actions. This will help us understand the differences between these perceptions which may hinder agreement over risk-mitigation measures. We will then train community members from selected 'at risk' neighbourhoods in order to pilot and test simple landslide risk monitoring and mitigation techniques at the community and individual household level, and the participants will evaluate the experience together with other agencies. The findings from these activities will then be reflected on by workshops bringing together community, public sector and third sector across what has been designated as a 'Strategic Intervention Area' (NE Medellin) in order to explore viable ways of achieving joint decision-making around landslide risk mitigation. 

The project will provide: (1) a functioning pilot community-managed landslide risk mitigation monitoring scheme, which will serve as a model to be replicated elsewhere after improvements based on the evaluation; (2) pilot individual house risk-mitigating improvements as exemplars in the (informal) community; (3) raised understanding and awareness of perceptions of risk and techniques and strategies that can mitigate landslide risk in informal settlements through collaborative action; (4) and identification of key questions around the interaction between technical, social, cultural and organisational knowledges to address in further research on landslide risk mitigation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project will build on the existing British Council-funded Medellin Urban Innovation (MUI) project between academics in the UK and Colombia and the relationships that this partnership has built up with other local stakeholders in Medellin. The proposal emerges from priorities identified through joint work developed by the MUI project, specifically during and following on from a multi-stakeholder forum on Housing &amp;amp; Habitat held in Medellin in April 2016, and from discussions held in Medellin with a range of actors (community, academia &amp;amp; local government) in August 2016 while co-designing this proposal.

The ultimate beneficiaries will be the estimated 44,600 informal settlement households currently at risk of landslides in the Medellin Metropolitan Area, expected to rise by at least 13,000 more by 2030 (URBAM &amp;amp; Harvard Design School 2012). At the local level, the findings from the research will inform decision-making and actions implemented by stakeholders involved in landslide risk monitoring and mitigation in the Aburr&amp;aacute; Valley including: community (Convivimos, Sumapaz, the Comuna 8 Working Table for Housing and Public Services, Territorial Defence Committees, as well as other Community Risk Management Committees); public sector (Consejo Territorial de Planeacion de Medellin; Oficina de Planeamiento de Medellin; Empresas Publicas de Medellin, EMP; Empresa de Desarrollo Urbano, EDU; Instituto de Vivienda y Habitat de Medellin, ISVIMED; &amp;Aacute;rea Metropolitana del Valle del Aburr&amp;aacute;; Red para la Gesti&amp;oacute;n del Riesgo en el Valle del Aburr&amp;aacute;; Sistema Municipal para la Prevenci&amp;oacute;n y Atenci&amp;oacute;n de Desastre del Municipio de Medellin, SIMPAD; and Sistema de Alertas Tempranas del Aburr&amp;aacute;, SIATA); and third sector (Corporaci&amp;oacute;n Montanoa). The project will provide inputs to the possible establishment of a Risk Management Council for the NE Urban Edge, as envisaged in the current Land Use Plan (POT) for Medellin, and to the new Metropolitan Land Use Plan under preparationtional projection will be ensured through establishing a dialogue with relevant international actors in the field including the Environment and Human Settlements Division of the Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL), EM-DAT, and USAID. The investigation will be of great interest to policy makers and practitioners across the Global South, where the majority of landslides worldwide have taken place.

Initially, specific case study communities in NE Medellin will benefit from training and in-situ piloting of community-managed risk monitoring and mitigation measures and, informed by the evaluation of this experience, will provide an initial core of 'trainers of trainers' to help spreading such measures across the Aburr&amp;aacute; Valley. Such pilot demonstration projects will also foster informal copying, which has been successful in the researchers' experience in other developing countries. At the local level, the research workshops and findings will potentially contribute to implementing cross-sectoral management of one of the Strategic Intervention Areas identified in the POT. The close involvement of the project partners in local and regional government will ensure that the project has an impact on the development of policy and practice moving forward. The regional and national levels of landslide risk management will be involved through targeted invitation to a National Forum in Medellin. An understanding of different stakeholders' perceptions, the findings from the in-situ pilots and co-design methods emerging from them, and the experience of multi-stakeholder workshops for strategic decision-making will provide a basis for changing attitudes and actions across the international and multi-disciplinary partners involved in the project and beyond. The collaborative nature of this research will contribute to challenge existing ways of understanding and managing risks and allow for learning through interaction across disciplines and contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>158909</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P015557/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97FC8337-8E84-46A6-ACF2-A6047DA8C582</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF2ECBC3-83AC-4763-B527-27A84805F0F9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>96F70ACB-D35F-416F-9360-4EFD402DFA6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Soil science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AECBB1F8-45A7-48B4-9FBB-31FE4206AA69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban &amp; Land Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
