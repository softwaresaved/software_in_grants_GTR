I will undertake such a flight at the Zhukovsky airbase in Russia, document the experience visually and conduct lightly 'semi-structured' interviews from other 'pilots' who have taken such a trip \n\n\nThe project will investigate four key areas:\n\n1 Identify what are the attractions of and pleasures available from such flights i.e. what dreams of flight are bound up with taking a ride in a military jet fighter, particularly in the former USSR? Is a type of cold war modernity being taken for a ride?\n\n2 Understand how this form of entertainment relates to the historical relationship between recreational games and the military, (be that through strategies or technology).\n\n3 Attempt to explain our prevalent pursuit of the 'thrill' in terms of our desire for speed.\n\n4 To analyse current contemporary theories on Modernity and how technologies become a means of expressing certain ideas and ideologies of a particular era.\n\n\nResearch Context \nThis research evokes the ancient, almost primal human desire to fly, reformulated in the C21st through military technology and entertainment. Historically games of all sorts have been concerned with conflict and it can be argued that paying for a ride in a military jet fighter is an elite offshoot this long standing tradition. \n\nEqually, this activity involves the pursuit of a thrill partially achieved through speed. This physical activity relates to theories posited by cultural theorist Paul Virilio who characterises our current era as a period of 'accelerated modernity'. He argues that the speed achieved through military technologies is now fundamental in explaining how global society works and how we experience the world \n\nThis project is also contextualised by the recent resurgence of interest with early forms of Modernisms expressed through major exhibitions including Tate Modern and the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum. Many of Modernisms pioneers often incorporated new forms of transport into their manifestos by way of expressing their ideas and ideologies. It is possible to view the ideals that these figures and movements held around vehicles as a historical point from which it is possible to compare the shifting symbolism of these technologies and the implications of their current imaginary status.\n\n\nResearch Outcomes\nThis research will be completed in two stages, first an exhibition of the photographs and films produced from my trip including interviews with other passenger pilots. This material will then be collated and re-produced as a website which will include a public forum for debating the questions raised by the research.\n\n\nResearch Application\nThis project involves new, valuable and timely research into what are usually considered peripheral recreational activities involving military technology. What underpins this research is the idea that technology is the material manifestation of human beings relationships with the world and themselves. It re-evaluates the importance of the dream of flight in this transmuted C21st form - at the intersection of entertainment with military technologies. \n\nPractically the project contributes to and extends the tradition within the arts from literature, film and fine arts that have used 'transport' as a device for exploring contemporary conditions. Whilst also interrogating, applying and extending current theoretical concerns regarding the role of the imaginary and images within narratives, be they verbal or visual, in the articulation of experience and how the lens-based image acts as an imag-inary stimulus provoking fantasy in relation to knowledge.\n\nIt is intended as a contribution to knowledge of both lens-basedtheory and practice and will be directly applicable to my teaching at SHU.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16430</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E006167/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>287497FB-DD4A-44CC-AC13-DBAFADC9AD82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
