These processes are often observed, measured or experienced as paths evolving over time in some state space. The effect of noise often makes the trajectory of these evolving paths unpredictable and highly erratic. In simple examples, such as the movement of a share price, the state space might be the non-negative real numbers. In more general examples the dynamics of the evolution may be constrained, such as the movement of a rigid body, or the evolution of particles in a section of the earth's atmosphere. This project will develop broad modelling framework for the analysis of highly-energetic random trajectories on curved spaces. A key ingredient of this will be the use Lyons' rough path analysis. 

The precise study of Brownian motion over the last century has led to spectacular results in the modelling of natural phenomena. Our understanding of manifold-valued Brownian motion was given great impetus by the Eells-Elworthy-Malliavin global construction of Riemannian Brownian motion. It is now however increasingly well understood that model based on Brownian motion are not always appropriate; persistence, long-time dependence and momentum are long-observed features of behaviour in queueing networks for internet-traffic, in hydrology, and in the fluctuation of market prices. Brownian motion belongs to a fundamental class of random processes in statistics called Gaussian processes. This class is both simple enough to work with, and broad enough to capture random memory-effects in evolving systems.

In this project will will combine techniques from stochastic analysis, probability the theory of rough paths and stochastic differential geometry to study, in a precise and quantitative way, properties of a class of Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds. We expect there to be interesting interplay between the randomness and the geometry of the space which the process inhabits. A key objective of the project will be to furnish the wider scientific community with deeper understanding and techniques which they can utilise in their work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will help to consolidate the established research strengths of the UK. By bringing together researchers from the stochastic analysis on manifolds and the rough path community it will give rise to new collaborations and thereby improve the efficiency of exchange between different branches of the subject. Academic channels and networks will be used to explore the implications of the projects key theoretical findings. We expect large impact down the line in the context of control theory and practical engineering problems; the project will provide new techniques in which practitioners in this field can formulate and analyse models. Visitors will be invited throughout the project with the aim of accelerating dissemination and hence impact. A workshop with participants from a variety of backgrounds (including industry) will further promote the impact objectives.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>87526</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on stochastic analysis, geometry and rough paths</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>41CB67CC-681F-421F-96CA-AF638AAE42DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We had very broad participation from senior speakers from across leading international institutions. Overall we had 21 speakers and 24 registered participants. Especially significant were the contributions of Hairer, who delivered a talk titled &amp;quot;Heat equation in a manifold&amp;quot;, which seems likely to be the starting point for much new research connecting regularity structures and stochastic differential geometry. The talk of Lyons, &amp;quot;Back to basics - using signatures to understand integrals&amp;quot;, explored new techniques in the use of rough path analysis in machine learning and in the analysis of high-dimensional data streams.

The grant also helped support the participation of emerging young researchers who are starting to make important contributions to progress in the above fields.The workshop helped to consolidate Imperial College in particular, and the UK in general, as a leading centre for research in rough path analysis and stochastic differential geometry in Europe. At least two important strands of research were initiated at the workshop (see the above paragraph). The deliberately interdisciplinary nature of the workshop brought together researchers from across a number of areas to facilitate exchange and impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sites.google.com/site/sarpg2016/program</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The objectives of this project are to investigate the properties of highly irregular randomly evolving systems typically taking values in nonlinear spaces, such as differentiable manifolds (think of a Brownian particle constrained to move on some three-dimensional surface, or the motion of a rigid body) . The key tool proposed to understand these systems is the the theory of rough paths, introduced by Lyons, which has given rise to considerable innovation in the stochastic analysis of random high-dimensional systems. In this context the key findings of this project so far are the following:

1. The development of the theory of infinite-dimensional rough path analysis and a theory of rough differential equations for manifold-valued paths. 

This provides the analytical framework in which to study the problems described in the project objectives. In so doing we closed a gap in the classical integration theory for infinite-dimensional rough paths (see Cass, Driver and Litterer, Proc LMS 2015 and Cass, Driver, Lim and Litterer to appear JMSJ, and a forthcoming paper coauthored by Cass, Driver, Lim and Litterer). These results opened up new collaborations with Driver (UC San Diego) and Lim (Imperial College and National University of Singapore).

2. A new Stratonovich-to-Skorohod correction formula for rough integration. 

An important feature of rough path analysis is that it provides an construction of the stochastic integral against a broader family of stochastic process than are admissible under classical theories. Gaussian processes are a fundamental class of stochastic process, widely studied and used in probability and statistics. In work with Lim (Imperial College and National University of Singapore) supported by this grant the PI has proved a new closed-form expression for the difference between the rough integral and the Skorohod integral for integrands given as path-level solutions to (rough) differential equations. This is a considerable and difficult generalization of existing results directly related to research objectives and likely to have long-lasting impact in follow-up work (see the box below on further work) . Investigation into this problem was greatly assisted by a research visit undertaken by Prof Samy Tindel to London in February 2015, which was supported by the award. 

3. Tail estimates for rough path functionals, concentration of measure, functional inequalities. 

A key ingredient in the findings 2 is the use of tail estimate for Gaussian rough paths which arise from the Gasussian isoperimetric inequality. The PI has extended this work to a class of Markovian rough paths associated to Dirichlet forms, which are subelliptic in the sense of Fefferman-Phong. These results have had immediate impact in connection with the work of Ni Hao and, separately, of Chevyrev and Lyons in connection with the expected signature (about which, see the box below). They should allow further links between rough path theory and functional inequalities, a broad area in modern stochastic analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>On the academic side we expect much immediate follow-up work. The field is moving at such a fast pace that, remarkably, some of this has already take place. E.g. the seminal recent work by Lyons and Chevyrev uses output 2 (above) in a vital way to provide examples for when the expected signature of a rough path characterises the law. We envisage output 3 having impact on research the optimal control (the PI is currently pursuing this with Yam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong). On the non-academic front, there has been an increase in the use of rough path techniques in connection with machine learning, especially around the Lyons group in Oxford. A spectacular recent development is to handwriting recognition software. We expect our contributions to provide important tools for researchers and developers in this and in related areas.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8EF77225-F258-40EA-B3D6-636704699EF2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/153F2E13-D7D8-4DD6-A616-E4635EE4DE27"><gtr:id>153F2E13-D7D8-4DD6-A616-E4635EE4DE27</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Stratonovich-Skorohod integral formula for Gaussian rough paths</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d1111ef6f98e7e20ccbadd0abd6776ef"><gtr:id>d1111ef6f98e7e20ccbadd0abd6776ef</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cass, T.R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/91939304-348F-4E2C-8F27-051D4871C6E2"><gtr:id>91939304-348F-4E2C-8F27-051D4871C6E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constrained rough paths</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6b43f7d90b5e337a92e267b44932cc4d"><gtr:id>6b43f7d90b5e337a92e267b44932cc4d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cass T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/75130A08-7727-44AC-B182-27A4910AB683"><gtr:id>75130A08-7727-44AC-B182-27A4910AB683</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the integration of weakly geometric rough paths</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Mathematical Society of Japan</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b743a8fcab99a299c481820388c952f9"><gtr:id>b743a8fcab99a299c481820388c952f9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>CASS T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A4B2DC4B-A397-4B91-806F-63EDBA5BCFDF"><gtr:id>A4B2DC4B-A397-4B91-806F-63EDBA5BCFDF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Intrinsic rough paths on Banach manifolds</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d1111ef6f98e7e20ccbadd0abd6776ef"><gtr:id>d1111ef6f98e7e20ccbadd0abd6776ef</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cass, T.R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6566EDB1-5F93-4AB3-B868-2069A8444E87"><gtr:id>6566EDB1-5F93-4AB3-B868-2069A8444E87</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the integration of weakly geometric rough paths</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/da43bc72eee2eac3f7f64727bddf5c74"><gtr:id>da43bc72eee2eac3f7f64727bddf5c74</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cass, T.
