&lt;p>It represents a timely response to a number of important legal, policy, monitoring and campaign initiatives introduced at this level that seek to tackle a range of children?s rights issues, with potentially transformative affects both at the national and international level.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The series comprises seven seminars that reflect key priorities at European law and policy level, including child friendly justice, violence against children, immigration, poverty and social exclusion and commercial exploitation. The seminars will take place in the UK and in Brussels over a two year period involving an interdisciplinary panel and audience comprised of young people, representatives from the European institutions, practitioners, NGOs and academics. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Relevant and sustainable knowledge exchange and capacity-building is the key rationale underpinning this seminar series and is central to generating impact. 

The beneficiaries of the seminars will include both academics and non-academics. Academic beneficiaries will include those researching in the field of children's rights, European law and politics and social policy. Participation will be drawn from early career academics as well as more established researchers, and will actively recruit PhD students with a view to developing further capacity in this emergent area of enquiry. Non academic beneficiaries will include policy-makers at European and domestic level, children's rights NGOs, practitioners from the legal, social work and education sectors working with children, and, ultimately children and young people themselves. 

The seminar series will impact on the beneficiaries in four main ways. First, the seminars will fill an identifiable knowledge gap in the nature, scope and potential of European-level intervention relating to children, particularly among academics and national/local policy-makers. The wide spread of disciplines represented in the series will provide crucial insight into a range of perspectives that this process demands, including EU constitutional law, international and European human rights law and politics, children's rights law and theory, and applied research methodologies. Established and early career academics, along with research students, will not only benefit from the opportunity to meet a range of international academics working in cognate disciplines, but also from the extensive international networking opportunities generated by the series. The series will yield sustainable, academic and knowledge-exchange benefits beyond the life of each seminar also, and beyond the participant group. This will be achieved through selective exposure of materials on the series website; through the development of high quality academic outputs (in the form of edited collections, special issues and briefing papers) and by providing the springboard for the establishment of a strong network of European children's rights experts. PhD students, early career researchers and more experienced academics alike will be encouraged to contribute to all of these activities.
Secondly, the series will allow for clearer communication of the obligations and benefits inherent in European children's rights measures with a view to stimulating more effective implementation, and with a view to identifying areas of further European intervention or restraint. This, in turn, will benefit stakeholders within the European institutions, providing them with a clearer channel of communication with user groups working at the coal face, enabling them to gain greater insights into the effects of existing children's right provision on the ground. Thirdly, the series will impact on international/national stakeholders - identifying ways of working in a more mutually complementary way with European actors towards shared children's rights goals, commensurate with their respective resources, capacity and competences.
The interactive format of the seminar series lends itself to a high degree of interdisciplinary exchange between the various participants. Moreover, the selected topics of the seminars deliberately correspond with current policy priorities at European level with a view to maximising their utility and relevance at the national level. 
Better policies and legal measures tailored to children's specific individual and environmental circumstances will generate longer-term, positive effects for the protection of children's rights, ultimately impacting on the societies in which they live.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30363</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We are in the process of developing, in collaboration with a group of children and young people, a series of online animations and talking heads to make the CFJ guidelines more accessible and meaningful to other children and young people.

The Council of Europe will receive the considered advice of young people with direct experience of the family justice system, on how best to make the Guidelines useful to children and young people themselves. As part of this, we are working with the children and young people to produce some simple yet effective online animations that can be uploaded onto social media and downloaded into print form;
We will also demonstrate to the CoE how children and young people can be engaged as partners in the policy evaluation, development and dissemination process.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>? Establishing a Young People's Reference Group. Investing in Children recruited a small (4-6) group of young people who have acted as a Reference Group, supported by the staff of Investing in Children and Helen Stalford 
? Organising 'Agenda Days'. An Agenda Day is a technique developed by IiC, to create an opportunity for children and young people to consider a particular issue and develop their ideas about it. It involves creating an adult-free environment in which children and young people can have a discussion about the Guidelines with a view to developing a more child-accessible version. 15-25 young people attended each of the two Agenda Days organised for this project.
? Purpose. The young people at the Agenda Days were asked to consider how accessible the CoE Guidelines are, and to make suggestions as to how they can be made more accessible. They were also asked to consider whether the Guidelines would have assisted them when they were going through their experiences of family proceedings, and make suggestions about what else might need to be done to make the adoption of the Guidelines more effective.
? Reporting. The Reference Group drafted reports from the Agenda Days to inform the creation of a draft child-friendly version of the Guidelines along with a commentary (still in progress). This commentary will include examples, drawing on the experiences of the young people, of how the Guidelines would apply in practice. Using video conferencing technology, all of the Agenda Day participants will be invited to come together to consider and endorse the final draft. 
The University of Liverpool (ECRU) will host a workshop on 26th Nov with the group of young people and IiC to develop an online, animated version of the child friendly justice guidelines. They will then be supported to use these resources to raise awareness of the guidelines among practitioners.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This collaboration builds on an existing collaboration between ECRU (the European Children's Rights Unit, University of Liverpool) and IiC (Investing in Children - a UK Community Interest which promotes the rights of children and young people). Following the first ESRC seminar on Child Friendly Justice, we were commissioned by the Council of Europe (CoE) to support a group of children and young people to develop a child friendly version of the CoE Child friendly justice Guidelines and to provide a commentary on what they believe will need to be done to make the Guidelines genuinely relevant and useable to children and young people themselves. We have worked in partnership with children and young people who have experience of family justice (care and divorce/contact/residence) proceedings to achieve this.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Making the Child Friendly Justice Guidelines Child Friendly</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F038ABA3-E02F-4773-BA3B-E2ADB7F09237</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A little early to comment.
