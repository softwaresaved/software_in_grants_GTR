In crystals without defects, 'perfect crystals', a traditional correspondence between discrete and continuous models of the crystal is enforced by requiring that the rotational symmetries of (cubic, tetragonal, monoclinic ,etc.,) discrete perfect lattices are also symmetries of corresponding continuous models. Logically, though, the perfect lattices have symmetries which are not rotations (certain shears map the lattices to themselves), and if one extends the traditional correspondence by requiring that the continuous models have all the discrete symmetries, one deduces (with some effort) that such continua cannot sustain shear stresses. This is an unphysical result which compels one to reassess the assumptions which underlie the mathematics, and the project considered the following main questions to address this observation:



(i)When a continuous solid crystal has defects, there is a priori no corresponding perfect lattice, but in certain cases (when the distribution of defects in uniform), there are indeed certain discrete structures associated with that uniform continuous distribution of defects. We knew at the start of the project that, according to the theory of Lie groups, there are just three basic relevant types of defect distribution, and we first of all identified, and studied, three canonical forms of these distributions. It became apparent that a considerable amount of mathematical material from the theory of Lie groups has (hitherto unrealized) application in this area, which is province of the physics/materials science community, at present;



(ii)We found that only some of the symmetries of the discrete defective structures extend to symmetries of the continuous structure (these may be called 'elastic' symmetries), by way of contrast with the situation in the perfect crystal case, where all discrete symmetries extend to (elastic) symmetries of the continuum. Thus, we showed that, in general, there is a natural classification of discrete symmetries as elastic or inelastic, based solely on geometrical information;



(iii)We considered the implications of the above facts regarding properties of the energy functions which play a central role in the mechanics of crystals with defects. It turns out that the above properties imply that energy functions have a (kind of) periodicity with is determined by the distribution of defects, which is important (it seems to us) because it shows that the simplest continuum models of crystals with defects must predict that there is a mechanical weakness only in certain directions determined by the geometry of the defect distribution (by way of contrast with the 'logical' treatment of the perfect crystal case, where there is weakness in all directions).).



The work has led to four peer reviewed papers in print, two such papers under review, so far, and aspects of the work have been presented at several conferences (nine international, one national). Details may be found on the Research Outcomes System.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are a first step in the provision of mathematical underpinnings for a systematic theory of materials with defects, based on purely geometrical information. One aspect of this is the construction of thoeretical discrete structures embedded in corresponding continua , which are then to be modelled using methods of continuum mechanics. 

 I cannot claim that the methods developed in the grant, and the findings, will certainly feature in the construction of new materials with distinctive properties, but those methods and findings do provide the beginning of a systematic approach to the modelling of a certain class of low dimensional structures (which may or may not be realized in practice). Once the methods are fully developed, their concrete benefits (and the new perspective) would have gain approval from the engineering community before any real application might take place, and this would in all likeliehood be a long term process - it would begin with promotion of the findings at international meetings with applied users in mind.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4E8982FA-2CEB-41EF-AC67-DC8A55E9257F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication
