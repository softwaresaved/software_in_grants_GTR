Iconic heritage is globally threatened by terror, climate change, rampant commercialisation, and overexploitation by tourism; and in the case of Egypt, significant disinvestment. Lack of responsible planning, maintenance and preservation strategies have equally caused unmitigated dereliction and irreversible damage to many heritage sites and cultural traditions in the medieval city in Cairo. Instability across the MENA region has prompted calls for the protection of culture and archaeological heritage as a political, economic and global challenge. With the increasing rate of destruction of heritage sites, digital preservation of historic artefacts and cultural heritage has arisen as an international priority. With tourism industry contributing 11% to Egypt's GDP and Non-governmental organisations, charity foundations and private sector enterprises are dramatically growing, technical and community support to this industry has become at the forefront of sustainable economy and social welfare of local populations. Yet, there are strategies, practices, skills and technologies that can protect, develop and sustain these places, in other forms of reproduction; such as digital modelling, immersive virtual and augmented reality, and cinematography and Audio-visual archives. 

Digitisation of heritage through customs, photo archives, film footage, oral history documentaries has become central for the preservation of national identity and effective tool in strategies of undermining radical ideologies in marginalised communities. The use of online platforms, virtual exhibitions and digitization of heritage is ever increasing and the virtual reality models of historic sites are becoming a main tool to engage with distant and remote heritage locations, yet stretch audience outreach and contribute to online income generating activities. Virtual environments which embed cultural heritage through digital media are often categorized as 'virtual heritage'. Such new media and technology platforms offer the possibility to experience virtually reconstructed historic sites or heritage sites as visitors, travellers or even as a resident. 

The proposed Cultural-feed Virtual Heritage CfVH collaborative network will develop projects, forums of exchange and activities that focus on undertaking creative and practice-led research on Imaging Cultural heritage in virtual environments. It will support young researchers, entrepreneurs to engage with innovative technological industry and inform policy makers and online tourism on the advantages and reward of engaging with digital platforms of virtual heritage. This project aims to help participants, academic and none-academic, to take part in the development, design and planning of virtual heritage platforms using latest technology (CAVE &amp;amp; Virtual HoloDeck) and develop practice-led workshops. 

Young professionals and graduates will acquire creative and technical skills that support self-development as entrepreneurs and offer venues for networking with UK-based experts and researchers. The collaboration is designed to train a catalyst group of 30-40 Egyptians to acquire, learn, practice and promote the digital production of Virtual heritage and support their future research projects of cultural and archaeological heritage, both in Egypt and in the UK. Participants will be trained for an average of 60-80 hours on research, production and business planning to help develop private enterprises and engage with local communities and school children. The collaborative network anticipates supporting 4-6 start-ups and research projects in the two years following its conclusion and will initiate graduate courses in Heritage Digitisation at Egyptian Universities and at the University of Wolverhampton with prospected 60-80 graduates over 5 years.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed collaborative network is designed to bridge the disparate arenas of research, creative industry, skill training, and job creation in Egypt that responds to future and growing needs of technology-driven generations. It anticipates raising the awareness of new technologies and accessible online markets for innovative research while supporting heritage preservation, not only in Egypt, but in the Middle East. The proposed programme will be the first platform and collaborative activities of its kind in the region that intends to attract researchers of digital heritage and supplements international organisations such as, UNDP, UN-Habitat and UNESCO with innovative tools and skilled researchers. Participants can contribute to the production of digital records, archives and virtual reality media that are increasingly used to support evidence-based findings and recommendations for action. 
 
This Network links innovative heritage research to digital modelling, virtual and augmented reality platforms, and online markets as a chain of supply and demand, which further supports wide range of smart and digital applications and industries. This collaboration identifies, through research in digital recording and VR modelling, filmmaking and visualisation of cultural heritage, new territories for research, studies, courses and online markets, yet to be unravelled in Egypt and the region. Association with Hi-Tec Industry, research institutions and VR laboratories in the UK will offer long term support for private sector start-ups and SMEs what would shift research landscape in Egypt towards more applied and practice-led research. 

The chief impact of this Network lies in its interactive and productive collaboration between Researchers and entrepreneurs, scholars and professionals, social scientists and digital technology engineers with shared interests in virtual and digital heritage preservation. Hence, the list of beneficiaries could be drawn through those involved in the programmes of training, knowledge-transfer and specialist entrepreneur career pathways. This project will influence early career researchers and produce educational material and case study models on the production of virtual reality models, cultural heritage digitization that would be a career for new generations of Egyptian graduates in different disciplines. This will deliver an impact on the long-term national agenda of countering radicalization of marginalised communities through creative education and sustainable urban development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66024</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Grand Egyptian Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Egypt, Arab Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Virtual Heritage of Medieval Culture: Collaborative Network for Cultural-feed of Virtual Heritage (CfVH) platforms of medieval Cairo</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE88DF89-D4B7-4584-9D45-3ADD049F6CBB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>RESEARCH REPORT 1: &amp;quot;Virtual Heritage Projects: Global Perspectives and Best Practice Manual&amp;quot;

The colloquium event moved to the astonishing Sultan Hassan Mosque and Madrassa on the second day. On the third day, participants enjoyed a full-day of exclusive visits and tour of the Medieval Islamic Cairo, that was led by the Senior staff of the Ministry of Antiquities, Dr. Mohammad Soliman and Mr Osama ElKasabany.

The Colloquium was attended by over 70 Participants over the two days of active panels, discussions and debate. The first day comprised two expert panels, made of 4 speakers/presentation each that handled various approaches of the virtual documentation of heritage through a variety of projects, methodologies and systems that are used to raise awareness and engage the public with the valuable assets of cultural archaeological heritage across the globe. They were followed by two round-table debates on the feasibility, potentiality and challenges that face Virtual environments and engagement with heritage, with particular focus on Egyptian context. 

The Second day comprised three panels led exclusively by Young Egyptian Researchers, start-ups and entrepreneurs who presented a variety of projects, initiatives and start-up businesses that dealt with both Heritage engagement and Virtual reality in architectural contexts in Egypt. Day two concluded with an open forum, where both experts and entrepreneurs exchange their views, concerns and demands for how such projects as Virtual Heritage in Cairo would be successful in building innovative platforms for the preservation of Cairo's medieval cultural and built heritage. The second day was concluded with a professorial tour of Sultan Hassan Mosque and its four different madrassa by both Professor Nezar AlSayyad and Dr. Mohamed Soliman to the delight of all participants.

Day three was designed to visit the medieval city, introducing its architectural marvels to the young researchers and professionals with exclusive access and guidance by the Ministry of Antiquities experts. The day was designed to make visits to potential fieldwork projects and sites that could be subject to virtual documentation and reproduction. These included Moque, Khanqah and Wekalat of Sultan El-Ghuri, Bayt AlSuhaimy, Bab Zuwailah, to name a few.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.virtualheritagecairo.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PUBLIC TALK at Egypt's Ministry State for Antiquities: &quot;Sustainable Management of Virtual Heritage in the 21st Century: Integrating Smart and Digital Preservation into the Creative Economies and Urban Policies of the Future Middle East&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC76A72E-1B03-43DA-9A9C-8D2B0E95213F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Mohamed Gamal Abdelmonem, Chair of Architecture at Nottingham Trent University and the Project PI has delivered a public talk at the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, as part of the public engagement activities of this project. Ministry officials, the Minister Executive Office organised the talk which has made significant change in the Policy makers views regarding virtual heritage in Egypt.

Brief of the talk is below:
Cultural and Archaeological heritage resemble the living memory of contemporary societies that makes sense of their past, present and foundation for the future. From the urban fabric, architectural character to the history of human experience, cultural and built heritage assets are unique aspects of human production that exhibit distinctiveness and authenticity of a city, culture and society. What is unjustifiably ignored is the fact that traditional quarters have never been frozen in time, nor produced at one moment in history. Rather, they are a product of multi-layered additions of cultures, styles, social and economical development. In the preservation of their rich history, policies in the Middle Eastern Cities have largely ignored technology, creative economy, industrial and spatial logic on their historic quarters while focusing on the reproduction or conservation of old buildings in forms of touristic attractions and images of the past. 

This talk investigates the tendency to modern technology in digitally recording and documenting cultural and archaeological heritage as part of the on-going histories of the contemporary city and how best new additions, management and activities of historic structures must be integrated into new economic and social possibilities for sustainable urban fabric. New technologies such as Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented reality, laser scanning, Digital modelling, and 360 photogrammetry shape new virtues of recording heritage that provoke new thinking and ideas about policies, regulations and management strategies of heritage. Using the analysis of long-term strategies for historical sites in European cities, Asian and Middle Eastern Cities, this talk makes case for progressive management, strategies and action-plan that debate policy-makers approach for the future of sustainable cities in Egypt and the Middle East. It envisages long-term smart, sustainable and digital strategies for conservation and self-sufficient, income-generating economies rather than being frozen museums for touristic consumption.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.virtualheritagecairo.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop 1: &quot;Recording and Modelling Cultural Narratives in Islamic Cairo: Foundational basis for Virtual Heritage Cairo&quot;, NRIAG, Cairo (31 Oct- 3 Nov 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E6ED583-16AB-407D-BC82-1485DACF84B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop 1 aimed to training Egyptian Early Career Researchers, Entrepreneurs and STartUps on essential skills that facilitate their work on Virtual Heritage Cairo's practical Projects.

Virtual Heritage Cairo's 1st International Conference: &amp;quot;Sustaining Heritage in the Digital Age: Towards Virtual Environments for Middle East's Cultural Heritage&amp;quot;; 20-21 February 2017, National Museum of Egyptian Civlisation, Cairo, Egypt.

Virtual Heritage Cairo's 1st International Conference: &amp;quot;Sustaining Heritage in the Digital Age: Towards Virtual Environments for Middle East's Cultural Heritage&amp;quot;, attracted researchers, scholars, scientists, academics, technologists and entrepreneurs from several universities, research centers, government agencies, and specialist industries and firms from around the world. It was the first ever international forum on virtual heritage to take place in the Middle East, where, academics, professional and entrepreneurs demonstrated their technological breakthroughs, projects and groundbreaking research in the field. The Conference was organized in collaboration with the University of Wolverhampton, Nottingham Trent University, Egypt's State Ministry of Antiquities, National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics, Queen's University Belfast. The Conference is sponsored by the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of the United Kingdom.

Papers and project presentations submissions were submitted under the following themes:
A. Digital preservation of heritage
B. Policy-making and heritage management in the digital age
C. Digital archives and sustainable recording of cultural heritage
D. Virtual environments and the future economies of tourism
E. Technologies and applications for virtual heritage.

This conference is a demonstration of successful collaborations and partnerships between British and Egyptian Institutions in the field of virtual heritage that brings together experts from Middle Eastern institutions, research organisations and universities from The United Kingdom, United States, Italy, Japan, Belgium and others within its Virtual Heritage Cairo Network. The collaboration between the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics (NRIAG), The National Institute of Oceanography and Fishery (NIOF) from Egypt and Nottingham Trent University, and Wolverhampton University from the United Kingdom, provided opportunities for new ideas, technologies and applications of virtual heritage to be discussed, debated and used to envision new ways of preserving our heritage in an innovative and creative manner. As Virtual Reality and The Cloud seem to dominate new generation of technological development in the Twenty First century, modern research, expertise and educational systems need to adapt quickly.

Virtual Heritage Cairo Network's first international conference supported the growing digital heritage sector in Egypt and the Middle East and organised a series of engagement activities and databases that brought together projects, specialist research institutes and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to technically-able entrepreneurs and researchers. The conference participants reported on recent and innovative projects and activities that focused on undertaking creative and practice-led research on imaging cultural heritage in Virtual Heritage. 

Over a very busy two days, conference participants debates and discussed the possibilities, capabilities and knowledge that have been developing in this field, not only in Egypt and the Middle East, but also around the globe. The conference had have four Keynote Speakers, five specialist panels that effectively cover global outreach, and over fifty Speakers and overall around 100 participants. The conference covered a wide range of approaches, regions, case studies and techniques. More importantly, The conference audience did not just listened to scholars and researchers, but speakers came from governmental agencies, young entrepreneurs who disseminated their experiences in this field. The Conference specially enabled several start-Ups who worked with Virtual Heritage Cairo's Network over the past 12 months to present their developed virtual heritage models and applications. The conference was the first global event to take place in Cairo and offer the opportunity to acknowledge the experience and progress of StartUps and young researchers in Egypt while offering them guidance on progress in the emerging sector of Virtual Heritage in the region. 

This conference concludes the first Phase of the Virtual Heritage Cairo Network, which will build into a broader, more inclusive and practical application of Virtual Heritage in Phase 2 &amp;amp; Phase 3. The Outcome of this conference as well as the past 12 months of Virtual Heritage Cairo Network, will be documented through a series of publications. There is a special issue of the International Journal of Architectural Research (Archnet-IJAR) is planned for Nov 2017 and a Conference proceeding with Cambridge Scholars Publishers.

Part of the impact of this project, is the evolution of further partnerships and conferences in the region. Virtual Heritage Cairo Network and its Conference are invited as partners for next year International Conference on Green Heritage in Egypt that is organised by The Centre for Sustainability and Future Studies at the British University in Egypt (2018) and to take part at the 8th International Ajman Urban Planning Conference in the United Arab Emirates. Partnership on advancing Virtual Heritage Research and projects were agreed with The University in Baghdad in Iraq, and the Chair of Prince Sultan Bin Salman for Heritage at King Saud University in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

In addition associated Researchers and Entreprenurs registered on the Virtual Heritage Cairo Network, have developed innovative StartUps and currently work with our Project team to develop their innovative products into marketable and income-generating applications of Virtual Heritage.

On the third day, we enjoyed a full-day of exclusive visits and tour of the Medieval Islamic Cairo, that was led by the Senior staff of the Ministry of Antiquities, Dr. Mohammad Soliman and Mr Osama ElKasabany.

The colloquium aims to introduce fact-finding research into the possibility and opportunities for digitising the socio-cultural heritage of Old Cairo's hawaris' (local alleyways) everyday life through virtual modelling of its physical settings supplemented by archival data, digital contents mined from cinema productions, televised reports and interviews with ordinary residents during the first half of the Twentieth Century. It attracted specialist researchers and entrepreneurs from architecture, sociology, virtual modelling, data-mining, and visualization and multi-media production to generate innovative and interactive digital models of medieval culture in Cairo. It is designed to achieve the following objectives:
? Building a network of effective partnerships and database of expertise and projects in the field of Virtual modelling of medieval cities' built and cultural heritage
? Identifying best-practice platforms of digital and virtual modelling of historic sites in Old Cairo that support the incorporation and representation of cultural data and Historic material.
? Identifying suitable interdisciplinary methodologies that offer inventive opportunities for visualising medieval cultural productions and bring cultural traditions, values and ideology (religious/ non-religious) into life on virtual and augmented reality platforms.
? Disseminating the needs for innovative platforms of heritage preservation in light of the political and security instability in the region and endangered heritage sites.

The Colloquium was attended by over 70 Participants over the two days of active panels, discussions and debate. The first day comprised two expert panels, made of 4 speakers/presentation each that handled various approaches of the virtual documentation of heritage through a variety of projects, methodologies and systems that are used to raise awareness and engage the public with the valuable assets of cultural archaeological heritage across the globe. They were followed by two round-table debates on the feasibility, potentiality and challenges that face Virtual environments and engagement with heritage, with particular focus on Egyptian context.

The Second day comprised three panels led exclusively by Young Egyptian Researchers, start-ups and entrepreneurs who presented a variety of projects, initiatives and start-up businesses that dealt with both Heritage engagement and Virtual reality in architectural contexts in Egypt. Day two concluded with an open forum, where both experts and entrepreneurs exchange their views, concerns and demands for how such projects as Virtual Heritage in Cairo would be successful in building innovative platforms for the preservation of Cairo's medieval cultural and built heritage. The second day was concluded with a professorial tour of Sultan Hassan Mosque and its four different madrassa by both Professor Nezar AlSayyad and Dr. Mohamed Soliman to the delight of all participants.

Day three was designed to visit the medieval city, introducing its architectural marvels to the young researchers and professionals with exclusive access and guidance by the Ministry of Antiquities experts. The day was designed to make visits to potential fieldwork projects and sites that could be subject to virtual documentation and reproduction. These included Moque, Khanqah and Wekalat of Sultan El-Ghuri, Bayt AlSuhaimy, Bab Zuwailah, to name a few.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.virtualheritagecairo.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2nd International Workshop: &quot;VISUAL REPRESENTATON OF CULTURAL HERITAGE in Online Environments Modelling Training Workshop on Virtual&quot;, 18-19 Feb 2017, NRIAG, Cairo, Egypt</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F5258E0B-AE4B-436E-BE8E-FDA8A180D3B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Second international Workshop took place at the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics (NRIAG) 18-19 Feb 2017, to enable each team to develop their processed and modelled VR version of their buildings into an interactive interface, that could link modelled spaces to other virtual platforms (e.g.: for on-line trade, exhibition, social networks, and others).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.virtualheritagecairo.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2nd International Colloquium: &quot;Visual Representation of Cultural Heritage: Opportunities, Economics,?Ethical and Moral Challenges&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3CDC191-39C6-4A15-BB1D-84200E19B2E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 2nd International Colloquium of the Virtual Heritage Cairo Network took place at the University of Wolverhampton in the United Kingdom on 30th January 2017. The Colloquium is titled: &amp;quot;Visual Representation of Cultural Heritage: Opportunities, Economics,&amp;nbsp;Ethical and Moral Challenges&amp;quot; and aims to drive&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;debate on the evident and potential&amp;nbsp;benefits of the&amp;nbsp;digital recording, preservation and marketing of cultural heritage through virtual and online&amp;nbsp;environments. We look at&amp;nbsp;virtual online&amp;nbsp;environments as an innovative and inventive domain that&amp;nbsp;enables and supports new&amp;nbsp;opportunities of income generation,&amp;nbsp;engages global citizens and supports virtual tours to remote heritage sites, or those sites whose visits are either not possible or pose considerable risk. The Middle East is the case in question for this colloquium, focusing on its peculiar situations, wealth of heritage sites at risk and what best strategies that could be done. 

In principle we ask two questions:
-&amp;nbsp;What Virtual&amp;nbsp;environments, digital recording, surveying and modelling offer to support heritage sites at risk?
-&amp;nbsp;How can heritage sites in troubled regions sustain self-sufficient financial support, economic feasibility,&amp;nbsp;accessibility and protection?

The Colloquium will debate and confront the challenges that face the effective and sustainable use of digital and virtual modes of recording, surveying and modelling cultural heritage sites and traditions in the heart of old and ancient cities in the Middle East. The Colloquium attracts multiplicity of specialist, academics, scholars and start-Ups entrepreneurs and Tech companies in both the UK and the Middle East. The event comprises three scheduled presentation sessions, followed by two Roundtable Panels by world experts in the field of virtual heritage as well as representation from Egyptian governments and academic institutions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.virtualheritagecairo.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Virtual Heritage of Medieval Culture has develop a a series of research and technical training activities that have provided a range of innovative and creative skills for the emerging sector of digital preservation in heritage in Egypt. 40 young researchers, young professionals, entrepreneurs, and start ups have joined our activities, gained new skills and took part in a series of practice-led innovative projects to researcher, survey, document and virtually model historic buildings and streets in Medieval Cairo. They have produced a range of virtual models that first produced in Egypt creating a new valuable creative economy and new industrial sector. The new spin-off start-Ups developed their own projects and their work expended to other historic sites with a various range of other clients.

The Ministry of Antiquities in Egypt has been involved in the Project activities and has hosted our seminar on Virtual Heritage Cairo in their headquarters, and our final conference at the newly opened National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation. In both occasions, the Ministry officials, executive office and policy makers took part in our debates and discussions. We are currently working with the government officials to proceed the first Policy document to manage and cover the production of Virtual Heritage in Egypt. This will highly implicate how Virtual Heritage as industry and sector will develop in the Region as creative economy.

Our project and activities has gained huge national media coverage and brought aspects of digital preservation methods to everyday debate in Egypt amongst specialists, professionals and academics in the country.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>085360BA-1E1B-4EF9-9DCC-7C335972F4CA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Virtual Heritage of Medieval Cultural (Virtual Heritage Cairo)

Summary of Project Findings

Throughout the 12 months' duration of the project, virtual Heritage of Medieval Culture, the research work, investigation, engagement activities and practical projects, involved multi-layered process of exploration of how creative and innovative industries would develop in the Middle East. The project uncovered multiple aspects of digital and virtual heritage through which it impacts our societies and is impacted by it. It is ingrained in the identity, psyche and everyday life of many people and communities. The nature of heritage and its relation with society is dynamic and changes with time. Hence, engagement with innovative digital technologies is becoming essential facet of its contemporary evolution. However, there is still several gaps to fill in order for the Virtual heritage industry to thrive in the region. These include better understanding of its processes, skill needs, technological infrastructure, research depth and above all legislative framework that enable its professional processes. 
In a brief summary, initial research project findings could be summarised in the following points. Please see the project reports for more comprehensive account of its findings.

? Archaeological and cultural heritage are valuable and indispensable assets of societies that play significant in the future of societies that should be seriously considered not only on the cultural front, but also on the socio-economic and sustainable vision of societies.

? Digital technologies and virtual heritage applications have the potentials of saving endangered and vulnerable heritage sites through early stage detection and analysis of structural failures.

? Virtual Heritage has a wide spectrum of technologies that involve wide range of equipment, instruments, software and tools. Their applications range from survey, recording and visualisation such as VR/AR to remote non-intrusive sensing, high sensitive imaging, and inspection of painting in exhibitions, museums and galleries. 

? Tech Companies and firms are advancing their technologies that will in no time be able to alienate governmental restrictions on documentation, recording and reproduction of heritage. Hence, Progressive approach towards engaging with and understanding virtual and digital heritage applications is needed to appropriately regulate it. 

? Restrictions and preventions is no viable policy in dealing with heritage management and protection in the digital age. New technologies changes and compromise any security restrictions that prevent engaging with heritage sites.

? Reproduction of heritage through digital and virtual forms raise few ethical more and legal concerns. These concerns require further collaborations from professionals and researchers in different fields of enquiry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project is being reported through a series of publications and policy document that would influence the practice, governance and management of virtual heritage sector in Egypt.
