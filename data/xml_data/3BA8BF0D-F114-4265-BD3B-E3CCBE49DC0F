Young people will also be followed into their transitions into the labour market. Through the identification of psychosocial factors, the project aims at investigating the main mechanisms by which education ultimately produce social benefits for young people. The project is planned in a comparative perspective and will use quantitative research methods applied to large scale longitudinal datasets (the BHPS and SOEP).&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will be based at the Centre for International Education (CIE) in the School of Education and Social Work at the University of Sussex working collaboratively with the Institut Arbeit und Qualifikation (IAQ) at the Universit&amp;auml;t Duisburg-Essen. As institutional hosts of the bid, CIE has a large network of collaborators which comprise international organisations (UN organisations, The World Bank, OECD), national government, national and international NGOs, and IAQ's networks include amongst others national and regional governments, international organisations, universities and other scientific research centres trade unions and employers' associations

Dissemination of project findings is particularly important not only for the UK and German governments, but also for less developed countries given that the 2012 UNESCO Global Monitoring Report will focus on skills development and include programmes that have succeeded in supporting economic and social benefits. With its strong reputation in international education and development, CIE has the capacity to disseminate (via website, email list, former and current students) results of this project to a wide audience. The Institute for Work, Skills and Training, as a centre for interdisciplinary and international comparative research in the social sciences and with its particular focus on employment, welfare systems, skills and training, will also disseminate project findings via student and university networks and via its website. The Institute has created its own web report series (the IAQ-Report) with a wide audience of both social scientists and practitioners from local associations and governments. 

Members of the research team have strong institutional networks and have worked previously for European and international organisations which can support the dissemination of findings. In 2009, the team worked on a CEDEFOP supported project looking at the social benefits of vocational education and training for ndividuals in Europe completed in February 2011. Our proposed project builds directly on the results obtained in this previous study and aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms for the transmission of the social benefits in England and Germany. 

A range of policy environments need to be informed about the mechanisms for educational effects and members of the team have institutional networks to achieve this. In particular, Ricardo Sabates has worked on several projects funded by the Department for Education in England, was a senior research fellow at the National Institute of Adult and Continuing Education (NAICE) and a consultant for the Independent Commission on the Future of Adult Learning in England. Thomas Haipeter worked on several projects funded by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BiBB) and by trade unions on qualification topics. We will work closely with both of these organisations throughout the study and by doing this we hope to directly inform both civil servants and NGOs working with practitioners and policy. 

In addition, we aim to disseminate the results of our research to both learning providers and young people. In England, we will work with the National Youth Agency and sister bodies to provide information on the social benefits of learning and articles to youth workers and agencies. We will develop a publication with key useful information for youth workers, on why education can influence on individual's health, wellbeing and social engagement. In Germany, we will link with trade unions and learning providers to promote the aspects of education that are relevant to healthier and more actively engaged youth. To reach a wider audience of youth, we will produce a short video clip for YouTube on the social benefits of education. This video will provide examples for differences in social outcomes in Germany and England, academic versus vocational learning, using results from the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>298072</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>WEBSITE

These differences are well-documented and are widely cited as a rationale for cross-country comparisons. However, it emerged from the study that while they appear to be very different, young people are participating in similar ways; it is simply that the points in time at which they become differentiated onto different trajectories happen to differ.
2) Post-compulsory education has a role to play in the formation of health and civic participation outcomes in England and Germany. However this role is limited according to the educational and social background of young people. Moreover, in Germany, the educational path chosen impacts on health and civic participation outcomes. 
3) Vocational education and training in Germany was linked to fewer positive outcomes than was initially expected. On the other hand, it was not too surprising that background factors were significant in determining both educational routes and social outcomes later in life. It would be interesting to investigate other outcomes in Germany to see whether the choice of outcomes affected the results.
4) The two datasets chosen for the study were not as comparable in terms of variables longitudinally as had been thought. Studies wishing to undertake a comparative analysis using these two datasets in the future would do well to investigate in more depth the exact nature of seemingly comparable variables and their recurrence in each country's dataset. The research was constrained by variables being unavailable in both datasets for as many waves as were needed for the longitudinal dimension of the research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E91C92D-D214-4B29-929F-ABB2EEC4123B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Construction,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J021326/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
