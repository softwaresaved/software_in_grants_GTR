Myelin is a fatty substance that wraps around long projections (axons) of nerves to allow rapid conduction of nerve signals and also plays a protective role for axons. Myelination, the process of sheathing axons with myelin, is a very active process early in life but continues well into later life. Remyelination is a natural regenerative process that replaces damaged myelin but ageing impairs the efficiency of remyelination in the CNS which can lead to neurological impairment with age. Thus, it is imperative that we understand this process of CNS repair in detail. 

Traditionally it was thought that the CNS was immune-privileged and that immune cells usually only entered the CNS during disease. However, in the past 5-10 years we have learned a great deal about how the immune system supports a wide range of basic functions of the CNS. In particular, a subset of immune cells called T cells have been shown to support neurological functions such as learning, memory and CNS repair. Other immune cells have also been shown to support remyelination, however, little is known about the role of T cells in this process. Interestingly, T cell function also declines with age and results in increased susceptibility to infection, cancer and decreased responses to vaccines. There has been one study that showed that deficiency of T cells impairs remyelination. However, T cells comprise a wide range of different subsets, each of which exert different, and often opposing, effects. We hypothesise that these different T cell subsets differentially influence CNS remyelination and that ageing of the T cells impairs remyelination in older individuals. 

To test this hypothesis we have established a new 3-D model of CNS remyelination in thin slices of brain tissue in a dish. In the first part of the study we will generate four different T cell subsets and add each population to a set of remyelinating brain slices to test what impact each subset has on CNS remyelination. T cells will be added to the solution the brain slice is cultured in and also directly onto the slice so that T cells can migrate into the CNS tissue. In this manner we can test if the effect of T cells on remyelination requires close contact with the area being remyelinated. In the next part of the study we will compare the effect of young and old T cells on remyelination to determine if ageing impacts the influence of T cells on remyelination. In the final part of the study we will introduce other types of immune cells to the remyelinating brain slice at the same time as the T cells to identify if T cells utilise other immune cells to influence remyelination in the CNS.

The outcomes of this study will include new knowledge of how the immune system, and T cells in particular, influence remyelination in the CNS. We will also learn a great about how ageing affects the ability of T cells to access the CNS and participate in CNS functions. Given the profound neurological impairments that can accompany ageing, and our growing aged population, is it imperative that we understand how normal CNS functions become impaired with age. This project will address a fundamental question of how the impairment of the immune system with age can have consequential negative effects on normal neurological function. Another outcome of this study will be further development of our new model of immune cell- neural cell communication which can be adopted by a multitude of scientists study a range of topics in neuroscience and immunology. Knowledge from this project may be taken forward to identify strategies to preserve remyelination, and thus neurological function, during ageing and as such, this project holds potential to impact a very large proportion of society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Ageing can profoundly impair neurological function with devastating biological consequences. Remyelination is a natural regenerative process that replaces damaged myelin to maintain insulation and protection of long axons. The efficiency of remyelination declines with age however underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. CD4+ T cells have been shown to support CNS processes such as learning memory and repair however the role of CD4+ T cells in remyelination has received little attention. One study showed that remyelination is impaired in the absence of CD4+ T cells. However, since that study in 2003, our understanding of CD4+ T cell phenotype and function has expanded dramatically to include a wide range of subsets that are functionally diverse and many are reciprocally antagonistic. Furthermore, ageing impairs CD4+ T cell responses but affects subsets differently. We hypothesise that CD4+ T cell subsets exert differential effects on remyelination and that aged-induced T cell immunosenescence impairs CNS remyelination. To test this we have developed a novel organotypic brain slice (OBS) model of murine hippocampal remyelination. Using transgenic reporter mice we will differentiate Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subsets and co-culture purified T cells with remyelinating OBS. We will determine the effect of T cell subsets on remyelination by quantifying remyelination in 3-D using a novel algorithm we have developed. We will investigate the effect of T cell ageing on remyelination by differentiating T cell subsets from young and aged mice and co-culturing these cells with remyelinating OBS. Finally we will increase the complexity of our technology by co-culturing remyelinating OBS with CNS antigen-specific T cells of each subset, mixed with myeloid cells, as would be more representative of the in vivo scenario. Together, these studies will provide insight to the influence of T cells in CNS repair and will develop further, novel technology to study neuroimmune interaction.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will impact a wide range of beneficiaries in academia, industry and the greater public. As age-related physiological decline is increasing in our ageing society, it is imperative that we identify underlying causes of such decline if we are to minimise this deterioration and promote healthy ageing. As this study is focused on the central nervous system, this work holds potential to impact people that will develop age-associated neurological impairment which can range from minor relatively minor impairments to severely debilitating motor, autonomic and cognitive impairments. By understanding why CNS remyelination declines with age we may identify strategies that can minimise such decline and preservation of a healthy functioning immune system may be one such strategy.

While this is a project investigating a fundamental biological relationship between the immune and central nervous systems, new knowledge we generate may inform optimal immune status to promote and maintain efficient remyelination. If this is the case, our discoveries will contribute to informing policy, lifestyle and life-long treatment of individuals to maximise CNS-relevant immune function with advancing age. As such, this work may impact a large sector of the ageing population.

This work will also impact research scientists primarily in the fields of neuroscience and immunology. However the technology we have developed can be exploited by these and other fields. Our novel image analysis software will be shared with the scientific community through publication and may be exploited by others for quantification of colocalisation of ambiguous structures in 3-D.

The work also holds potential to impact industry through development of academic-industry partnership with IP generated. Indeed we already have struck up such a relationship with iPath Diagnostics which will be strengthened by this study. The University will also benefit in publicising the discovery research it will host in this work and through commercial exploitation. Indeed commercial exploitation of discoveries in this project holds potential to generate income and employment in the UK. Indeed, this project will direct employ 2 part time scientists and one full-time PDRA who will benefit greatly in terms of career development. This project will also strengthen my group's collaboration with key opinion leaders in neuroscience and grow our relationship with commercial entities such as iPath.

Finally and importantly, this research programme will provide stability, longevity and productivity to my new laboratory and will reinforce the cutting-edge, collaborative neuroimmunology research programme I have begun here at QUB.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>424590</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NI Science Festival 2016 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CB8579C4-8311-472A-80C7-5E57F7B5605E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We hosted a 'Brain' station at the recent 'Know Your Enemy' event on disease research at QUB that was part of the Northern Ireland Science Festival.
