production: transitions between wet and dry ecologies</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/N010957/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Rice is one of the worlds most important crops, and it has a long history of supporting dense populations and civilizations throughout East, South and Southeast Asia. This project will reveal the history of rice cultivation comparatively across the region using cutting age archaeological science. One major aim is to reconstruct how rice was grown across the region at different times. Rice may be grown in wet cultivation systems (irrigated or flooded) and dry cultivation (based only on rainfall, often in upland areas), and in intermediate lowland, rainfed conditions. These different systems have important implications in terms of how productive rice is, and therefore how much human population it can support, as well as how labour-intensive it was. Dry systems yielded less but also cost less in terms of labour. How rice was grown has important implications for the impact that humans and rice had on environmental change. Intensive systems tend to require greater landscape modification and by supporting higher populations have knock-on effects on other resources, for example through deforestation. Another very important impact is the production of methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Dry rice cultivation systems produce little methane whereas the more productive wet systems produce a lot. It has been hypothesized by some climate scientists that methane from rice contributed to an anomalous rise in methane over the past 5000 years which is not explained by natural sources. If so, then this has contributed to global warming even before the industrial era and will need to be factored into models that hope to predict where global climate change is going. One of the aims of this project is to ground truth this hypothesis by modelling up from the empirical archaeological evidence for rice cultivation over time to assess whether this fits with explaining at least part of the methane anomaly. In order to do this we need better evidence not just for where and when rice was cultivated but also whether it was grown in wet or dry systems. Through systematic study of archaeologically preserved seeds, we can identify the weed flora associated with past rice and whether it fits with a wet or dry system. In addition we have developed methods for classifying the assemblages of phytoliths (microscopic silica from the decomposition of plants) from archaeological sites as indicating wetter or drier rice cultivation regimes. We are now hoping to apply these methods over a larger number of sites and regions, especially regions for which archaeobotanical evidence for early rice is limited or lacking, including parts of India (western and northeastern), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, and southern China (Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong). By combining these new results in a GIS modelling system, together with data from other parts of the region, mostly collected by us and colleagues over the past few years, we will be better able to produce realistic spatial models of the spread of rice, the extent of wet rice, and likely methane emissions over time. We will also be able to improve our understanding of how the development of rice agriculture relates to the long-term history of human societies in this region.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect our results to have an impact on policy makers considering climate change and greenhouse gas mitigation and agricultural policy, and within Asian countries those concerned with cultural heritage education; and we will impact a wide interdisciplinary set of academic audiences. We also hope to reach a wider public through our web-based outreach, including education and training videos.

1. Policy makers (in relation to agriculture and climate change): Rice paddies are a major source of greenhouses gases, but an active area of academic debate revolves around the extent to which prehistoric rice paddies contributed artificial methane to rises of global temperature before 1700 AD. If so, this has implications for the baseline starting point of predictive climate change models on which mitigation strategies are based, and one form of mitigation may include shifting from wetter to drier forms of rice cultivation. Our results will directly assess the likely contribution of prehistoric rice to pre-modern methane levels. Our preliminary results on this have already been cited in the Fifth Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Stocker et al eds. 2013 citing Fuller et al 2011). A better understanding of the agricultural past, its successes in sustainability and its impacts on environmental change can only be a positive in planning for the future.

2. Cultural heritage sector. Agricultural heritage is a newly emerging sector that is increasingly taking its place alongside monumental heritage in the presentation and teaching of the past, in schools, universities and museums, but this is still an underdeveloped area of research and teaching in many countries, especially across tropical Asia. We will strive for a direct impact in this area by hosting training events in archaeobotany and rice agricultural history and its relation to climate change in countries where we work and where rice is a major staple, including India, China and Thailand. We will reach out to students and future researchers directly and by making videos from these events for online distribution we will aim for a lasting outreach to a more global audience (see Pathways to Impact Plan).

3. Interdisciplinary impact with the academic/research community. This is detailed above under &amp;quot;academic beneficiaries&amp;quot; but should be noted that the track record of related research by the PI has had an impact across geographical sciences, life sciences and humanities, by being of relevance to geneticists, rice researchers, the quaternary sciences, and linguistics, as well as its own subject area of science-based archaeology.

4. Through our website (www.ucl.ac.uk/rice), which we plan to expand and revamp, and videos we will be able to reach wider audience. As rice is such a well-known crop everywhere it can intersect with many age groups and communities as lens into considering the long-term transformation of the earth through agricultural production.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>628201</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have established that the earliest rice cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia appear to be have cultivated as dry rice, i.e. based on rainfall rather than irrigation, and it was probably cultivated this way from ca. 2000 BC to 100 BC in Thailand and elsewhere. This differs from the earlier rice cultivation in the Yangtze basin in China, where rice was cultivated in wetland habitats going to back to at least 5000 BC. These wetland habitats are confirmed by our work on weed ecology from both archaeological seeds and phytoliths. Therefore somewhere in Southern China or norther Southeast Asia there was a transition to dry rice.

After this time, during the Iron Age (final centuries BC to early centuries AD) there is a marked shift towards irrigated rice: this is indicated in a shift in the weed flora associated with rice cultivation.

All of this early rice cultivation (in China and Southeast Asia) appears to be subspecies japonica. The long-grained subspecies indica, we hypothesize to have evolved in India from complex hybridization between introduced japonica and management of native wild rices, sometime between 4000 and 3500 years ago. What we can say with some certainly is that morphological rices that look like subspecies indica in Southeast Asia arrived more recently than 2000 years ago.

Early rice cultivation in northern India also appears to have been rainfed, while wet forms of rice cultivation and dyr rice both spread throughout the Indian Peninsula at various times between 1500 and 500 BC.

As wetland rice is a major source of methane, we currently infer that anthropogenic contribution to methane in the atmosphere that come from rice cultivation have increased markedly in the last 2000-3000 years, and earlier hypothesized sources anthropogenic methane are unlikely to come from rice. We are currently refining and testing this hypothesis, and expanding or archaeobotanical evidence for rice cultivation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings should be of wide use in archaeological studies throughout South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia.

Our finds also can inform modelling of the genetic and phylogenetic history of rice, which is relevant to the preservation of genetic diversity, which in turn it relevant to breeding to improve sustainability of rice agriculture.
