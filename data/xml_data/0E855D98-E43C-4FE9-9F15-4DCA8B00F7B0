The religious renaissance of the late and post-Soviet periods took the world largely unawares: How had faith survived the atheist onslaught? Why had people turned in such large numbers to the church? What does this tell us about the process of 'secularization'? \n\nDuring the Cold War, the West saw Christians in the Soviet Union as potential allies against the communist regime, particularly Baptists and Pentecostalists, who had religious roots in Britain, Germany, and the US. The Soviet authorities were, of course, displeased by the overtures of overseas religious groups and targeted Protestants as lackeys of the West. Although under Stalin, the treatment of Protestant groups had not been worse than for any other religious group (bad though this was), by the Khrushchev era 'sectarians', as the state labelled them, were passionately demonized. Despite this persecution, Protestant communities not only survived, but even grew. Writing about the post-Soviet period, Sergei Filatov has argued that the destruction of church traditions under the communist regime led to the disappearance of a coherent religious worldview and that by the beginning of perestroika 'the religious consciousness of Russian citizens was an amorphous, eclectic mixture of different beliefs'. By taking a longer-term perspective, this project explores how a sense of spiritual quest, rather than a fixed religious identity, might have characterized the religious consciousness of many Russian and Ukrainian citizens not just in the twilight years of the communist regime but throughout the Soviet period, and particularly in the wake of the trauma of the Second World War. It asks why Protestantism became the spiritual refuge of choice for growing numbers of Soviet men and women, including many who had not been raised in a religious milieu. This has important implications for the Soviet project as a whole because it explores the limits of the state attempt to shape the 'new Soviet person' and the potential for alternative worldviews and beliefs to exist and even thrive within the USSR.\n\nAn innovative approach will be taken, combining both archival research and oral history conducted in four specific regions: Moscow; Kiev; Chernovitsi; and Voronezh. In the archives, reports on the religious situation written by local state offiicals, court cases involving Protestants, and sociological questionnaries about religious belief provide a fascinating and almost unused body of material. Oral history provides access to more intimate experiences and well as allowing us to explore how believers, twenty years after the collapse of Soviet power, make sense of their experiences. Studies of 'totalitarian' societies have already used oral history to reflect critically on the relationship between memory and experience, but our attempt to integrate and compare oral and written accounts in order to explore the shifting and fluid nature of life-stories will provide an original methodology as well as rich material about the lives of believers. \n\nThe project will result in three major outputs: a website in both Russian and English allowing users access to selected archival documents and interview transcripts; a collection of documents relating to the history of Protestantism in the Soviet Union (for a Russian audience); and an academic monograph in English. We will also disseminate our findings to baptistic communities in the UK, Rusisa, and Ukraine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the scholarly communities discussed in the 'academic beneficiaries' section, this project will have an impact on a broader public. As a result of the political situation, it is currently difficult for scholars in Russia to find the funding necessary to publish works relating to religious minorities, yet members of these communities are often keen to trace their own history. Several groups have created their own website forums to which congregations have submitted accounts of their own local histories. The publication of a collection of key documents from the state archives will provide these groups with access to information previously restricted to a small number of professional historians who have been able to work within the archives in Moscow. In addition, the project website will provide access to several of the interviews. As the site will be in English and Russian, it will also engage an audience outside of Russia and Ukraine. In particular, we anticipate interest from Baptist communities and have established contacts with the Baptist Historical Society in the UK. We plan to create an online forum for contributions from both Russian / Ukrainian believers and for foreigners who had contacts with baptistic groups during the Soviet period. They will be invited to shared memories of the Soviet era and to reflect on how the political changes since 1991 have affected their religious life. As well as eliciting interest in our work, we hope that this will also provide contacts for further research, potentially for a short follow-up piece on British experiences as missionaries and Bible-smugglers in the USSR. In order to bring our research (and the project website) to the attention of these communities we plan to write short pieces for the following: 1) Russian websites such as the Russian Union of Evangelical-Christian Baptists (www.rosbaptist.ru) and 'Protestant' (www.protestant.ru), 2) Russian journals such as Religion and the Law (Religiia i pravo), 3) The new 'almanac' of Russian Baptist history to be published by the Russian Union of Evangelical-Christian Baptists, and 4) the Baptist Quarterly and the Baptist Historical Association website.\n\nA second distinct user-group will be students. Currently undergraduates in universities across the English-speaking world take modules on Soviet history and many write projects or dissertations on this topic. They are restricted, however, by the kinds of materials which are available to them in translation, which means they often use primarily literary works or memoirs written by members of the intelligentsia. The site will allow them to use archival and oral history materials to explore the religious history of the late Soviet period and to reflect on the experiences of a distinct, and understudied, segment of Soviet society. We hope to publicize our project through the immensely popular www.soviethistory.org (and have collaborated with the site's authors in the past).\n\nWe will also publicize to a wider public. A contact at the BBC Russian World Service website is interested in publishing a piece on the project and we will also propose a feature to a popular history magazine such as BBC History. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>148817</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Talk and Book Presentation (Moscow)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>03001EBF-B4F4-4993-94D8-AAF2CB220C2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The evening provided an opportunity to present the project's book ??????? ? ???????????? ??????? ????????????? ????. 1940-1980-? ??. ???????????? ? ?????????

Two key outputs for impacting on non-academic audiences were envisioned in the award. The first was a published document collection containing extracts from the oral history interviews and archival research, accompanied by clear and accessible analysis. The book was launched in December 2015 with an evening hosted at the Pokrovskii Cultural Centre in Moscow. Over fifty members of the public attended and listened to talks by N. Beliakova (co-author and Research Assistant on the project); the cultural attach&amp;eacute; to the Vatican's Embassy in Moscow; a journalist; various representatives of the Evangelical Christian-Baptist community; an Orthodox priest; participants in the oral history component of the project; academics and researchers. The project website, soon to be launched, show-cases highlights from the archival and oral history material collated, as well as including analysis written by the PI.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F81A3E2D-89FF-44C6-8346-262F49BF4FB7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>* Please note that although funding period for the project ended on 30 June 2016 I was on maternity leave from February 2016 to March 2017. The department is therefore allowing me to take four months of research leave still out-standing. This means that whilst all the fieldwork is complete, the findings are not in a finished state. A fuller report will be submitted in my next submission. 

The findings of the project fall into three key areas: the Soviet state's treatment of the religious minority under study (Baptists, Evangelical Christians and Pentecostals, hereafter ECB); the nature of religious life in these communities, in particular issues surrounding authority and community; and finally the narratives strategies deployed by believers, both during the Soviet period and in retrospect.

Religion, it has been argued, is essential to the construction of modernity: by dictating the place and nature of acceptable religious behaviour the modern state displays and reaffirms its own power and establishes a dichotomy between the rational and enlightened nature of secular governance and the dangers of untamed, uncontrolled religiosity. In the Soviet case, the assertion of modernity - packaged as 'progress' - was absolutely central to the regime's claim to legitimacy and the binary with religion especially prominent. Paradoxically, the Soviet party-state needed believers, even as propagandists, state officials, and social scientists ostensibly laboured for their extinction. I show that the 'believer' played two quite different roles in the Soviet imaginary as a result of these conflicting pressures, one based on rights, the other on demonization. I also argue that the dynamics of the Cold War were instrumental in consolidating the believer's ambivalent and contested place in the Soviet imaginary after 1945. The importance of the Cold War in shaping the Soviet state's approach to religion is proving an important and unexpected finding from the project. 

The bifurcated approach outlined above shaped the way ECB congregations were treated throughout the post-war era. In the mid- to late- 1940s the Soviet state created a new infrastructure for regulating religious life, one element of which was the formation of the All-Union Council of Evangelical Christians-Baptists. The new structure seemed to suggest a legitimate place for the church in the post-war era, but its establishment did not end the state's use of repression against believers. The story of the ECB church in these post-war decades is often presented in terms of state pressure on the one hand and brave dissidents who left the registered church to embark on a life in opposition on the other. Our research suggests a rather more complicated set of responses, with the authority of the AUCECB - and the male pastors it appointed - often contested even within registered congregations. One fault-line previously overlooked in much of the existing literature relates to gender and the roles taken by women within congregational life. This emerged as a key and unexpected finding from the oral history research conducted for the project. 

What is striking about the communities examined here is the sheer volume of written texts they created: letters written to the church leadership, petitions written to various state bodies, appeals sent to overseas organizations (such as the UN), and memoirs, published overseas or in samizdat form during the Soviet era, or retrospectively since 1991. Writing emerges as a key form of establishing and consolidating group identity. Our oral history interviews are rather different in nature, with some speakers lacking the sense of narrative order that those wrote autobiographical texts, of whatever genre, were able to bring to bear on their life-stories.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will contribute to academic work on a range of topics. As envisaged at the outset of the project these include not only researchers working on religious issues within the USSR, but also a range of scholars - including historians, anthropologists and sociologists - who are examining late Soviet society, particularly the contested nature of identity. As it has evolved, the outputs will now also contribute to academic discussions of gender relations in the USSR and, perhaps most excitingly, to wider debates about the nature of the Cold War. In particular I hope that my adoption of the term 'religious cold war', coined by Andrew Preston in relation to what was happening in the USA in the 1940s and 1950s, will contribute to the comparative history of cold-war societies which is beginning to emerge.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8F143C78-4EA2-44A4-9E57-2CEEE617C67C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F911513E-A005-456F-A447-EC5A7826EA22"><gtr:id>F911513E-A005-456F-A447-EC5A7826EA22</gtr:id><gtr:title>Child Sacrifice in the Soviet Press: Sensationalism and the &amp;quot;Sectarian&amp;quot; in the Post-Stalin Era</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Russian Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a1f49fdd9a5bd7d166e82e4164def439"><gtr:id>a1f49fdd9a5bd7d166e82e4164def439</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>DOBSON M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F8D57724-1EF7-458F-A481-0BD618EB4ECD"><gtr:id>F8D57724-1EF7-458F-A481-0BD618EB4ECD</gtr:id><gtr:title>??????? ? ???????????? ??????? ????????????? ????. 1940-1980-? ??. ???????????e ? ?????????
