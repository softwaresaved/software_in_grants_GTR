The area has seen some of the most dramatic events in modern history fought out over the invention of 'ethnic nations', still a powerful form of collective identity building today. Scholarship often considers these identity building projects either from the 'top-down', on the level of the nation state or region, as agents of construction; or from the 'bottom-up', seeking to define the place of individuals and minorities who contested the process. 

In this project, we aim to revise the notion of 'ethnic minority', such as the 'Germans of Timisoara', 'Jewish Lodzer', the 'Ukrainians of L'viv', by examining how they distanced themselves from the majority whilst maintaining their 'privileged' status. We propose a specific definition of 'subcultures' to show how these groups in fact existed in the interstices of ECE identity-building projects, partly adopting and partly rejecting the majority agenda and/or the cultural practices of other minority groups.

'Subcultures' are not understood as 'passive' colonial communities; non-normative and/or marginal groups in urban environments; or as subaltern youth cultures. In the specific context of ECE, the term 'subcultures' expresses a multi-layered, simultaneous form of identity, which developed 'underneath' the locally dominant project of identity construction but was not in a 'subaltern' position; neither necessarily opposing the majority, nor excluding it. In sum: our use of the term aims at a better understanding of these complex, shifting, and often-contradictory forms of ethnic identity.

We will study subcultural identity construction through case studies of five cities in Poland, Romania and West Ukraine, combining different historical approaches. The longue dur&amp;eacute;e perspective transcends the periodic limitations, which obscure the fact that ECE identity-building projects in the 20th century drew on an eclectic range of elemets from different historical experiences: Imperial; Republican; Wartime; Communist; post-Communist. This not only offers a key to understanding the specifics of identity building in ECE, but also provides a more sophisticated approach, with contemporary relevance, that challenges the mapping of Western experiences elsewhere. Our perspective suggests that we do not have a conflict of cultures (majority vs. minority) but simultaneous constructions of cultures cutting across national borders and historical periods. 
 
This project brings together four participants across two institutions (University of Oxford and Oxford Brookes University). It combines the linguistic skills and disciplinary range of: Jan Fellerer, a historical linguist with German, Polish, Czech and Ukrainian; Marius Turda, a historian with German, Romanian and Hungarian, and Robert Pyrah, a cultural historian of post-Habsburg ECE with Polish, German and Ukrainian. It also includes the training of a Ph.D. student to provide career development within the field.

This project will reach audiences inside and beyond academia through workshops in Oxford (Years 1-2), in Central Europe (Year 3), a closing international academic Conference (Year 4), plus outreach lectures at National Cultural Institutes in London and the region, podcasting of material and a website. An edited volume arising out of the Workshops and the Conference, a monograph, as well as refereed journal articles resulting from the investigators' research, are also planned; and a seminar series led by the investigators at the University of Oxford on Central Europe utilises an established academic forum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is likely to attract interest beyond academia, since processes of identity construction in ECE have continuing contemporary relevance as evidenced by the recent and periodic outbursts of radical political ideologies in the region.

Main beneficiaries outside academia include:

1. National cultural institutes, societies and associations, both in the UK and ECE, and their wider user groups. 
Specifically:
- The Austrian, German, Polish, Romanian and Hungarian Cultural Institutes, London.
- The British-Ukrainian Society, London.
- The Austrian Cultural Forum and Romanian Cultural Institute, Warsaw.
- The Austrian Cultural Forum and Polish Cultural Institute, Kiev.
These bodies organize cultural events which focus on broadly defined regional themes. Investigators have established links with these bodies and will be able to develop this interface between academia and public bodies in international cultural relations, specifically offering up to 10 public lectures at these institutions over the course of the project (cf. Outputs).

2. Local policy makers in the cities being studied: 
- The local policy makers (e.g. councillors) take decisions on highly sensitive issues, such as minority rights, the construction of memorial sites, the organisation of commemorative events. 
- They sponsor historical research and shape education policy (e.g. textbooks like Oleksandr Shishka's recent series on L'viv). 
There is awareness in East-Central European countries that, in democratic policymaking, such decisions need to be based on balanced views about the past that withstand scholarly scrutiny. The project findings will respond to that need, actively involving city councillors through interviews conducted by the RA and inviting them to the Year 3 Symposium. These activities support the strengthening of civil society initiatives. 

3. Relevant foreign policy makers with special expertise in the new EU member states, e.g. London-based ECE diplomats who have close links to the named institutions under point 1 (e.g. the PI/CI/RA's existing Central European seminar in 2011 included lectures from the Austrian, Hungarian and Romanian Ambassadors) with the potential to strengthen diplomatic links between the UK and ECE.

4. The wider general public in Britain.
Recent mass immigration to the UK and Ireland in particular from East-Central Europe (Poland foremost) has generated a latent interest in the new EU members of East-Central Europe. 

These beneficiaries will be engaged through:

- English-language publications, project website and freely accessible podcasts (see Outputs).

- Academic dissemination (see Outputs): 6 refereed journal articles; 1 edited volume with a joint introduction and 1 monograph (in English); 2 Workshops and one International Conference (Oxford).

- Local dissemination:
i. Through our East-Central European Cultural Politics Symposium, to be held in Ukraine at the L'viv Center for Urban History of East-Central Europe. We will invite city councillors from the region. 
ii. Additional articles in influential general periodicals in the region itself, particularly: Kiev-based Krytyka; Lodz-based Tygiel kultury; Wroclaw-based Odra; Cluj-based Korunk and Timisoara-based Orizont.

- Up to 10 public lectures by the PI/CI/RA at regional Cultural Institutes in London, Warsaw and Kiev (cf. above). This initiative reaches wider public constituencies through the extensive mailing lists and networks of these bodies which frequently work in collaboration, and are in established contact with the CI and RA. Radio broadcasting will be explored as a means to extending the project's impact.

Finally, through its scope in general, and through substantial career development for the RA and training of a Ph.D. in particular, the project contributes to addressing a long-term skills deficit in languages and Area Studies, especially in less commonly taught languages.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>692896</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Centre for Urban History of East Central Europe</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ukraine</gtr:country><gtr:description>Center for Urban History of East-Central Europe, L'viv, Ukraine</gtr:description><gtr:id>408A251E-A97F-4777-A58C-0B08EBE606A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research visit and lecture at the Center in L'viv (Jan Fellerer, April 2012); Joint seminar in the East and East-Central European Seminar in Oxford (Center Director - Sofia Dyak, April 2013); Joint workshop participation in Krakow (all project participants, Center Director - Sofia Dyak September 2014); Planned joint symposium, involving local cultural policy makers, in L'viv (all project participants and various representatives of the Center, September 2015)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint seminar; workshop participation</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Research visits; lectures</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Uniwersytet Pedagogiczny, Krak?w</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Poland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Instytut Historii Uniwersytetu Pedagogicznego, Krak&amp;oacute;w, Poland</gtr:description><gtr:id>2FD52489-2352-4CDA-95EF-91C2C93EB3F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint workshop on sub-cultures at the Historical Institute of the Pedagogical Institute in September 2014, with participation of all members of the project as well as various representatives of the Historical Institute, possible future joint publication and further workshop participation</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Conceptual and organisational towards a joint workshop at the Historical Institute of the Pedagogical University in September 2014</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Conceptual and organisational towards a joint workshop at the Historical Institute of the Pedagogical University in September 2014; possible future joint publication</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Dublin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Trinity College Dublin</gtr:department><gtr:description>Trinity College Dublin</gtr:description><gtr:id>012FBCEE-5EB2-467D-AC1D-66FF7F42C8D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Plans for future common conferences and exchange of student supervision</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>It opened new venues of collaboration between Oxford Brookes University, Oxford University and the Centre for Euroepan Studies, Trinity College Dublin</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In March 2014 Marius Turda was invited as a visiting professor to Trinity College Dublin, and gave two lectures on ethnic subcultures and eugenics in Central and Eastern Europe</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Romanian Institute for Research on National Minorities (ISPMN</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Romania</gtr:country><gtr:description>Seminar at the Romanian Institute for Research on National Minorities, Cluj</gtr:description><gtr:id>1CC7420B-00FA-483E-838B-8FC206CBC580</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The scholarly debate was instrumental to inform our ongoing research and to understand its relevance in the 'target' region.

According to the Impact Plan for our project, we held a Central European Cultural Politics Symposium in September 2015 where we entered into a dialogue with, and facilitated dialogue between, academics, local cultural policy makers and activists from L'viv (Ukraine), Wroclaw (Poland), Cluj and Timisoara (Romania) about hybrid, 'sub-cultural' identities and their legacies in these East-Central European cities. A wide range of institutions and initiatives was involved: L'viv city council, European Capital of Culture / Wroclaw, local grassroot initiatives for urban redevelopment (e.g. Nadodrze Initiative / Wroclaw; Iota Initiative / L'viv; Igen, Tessek / Cluj), local cultural initiatives (e.g. L'viv Film Center, Centennial Hall / Wroclaw, AltArt / Cluj). Our project research agenda and research findings presented at the event and in subsequent contacts raised cross-regional awareness of multi-ethnic legacies and has informed subsequent programme discussions and decisions at some of the institutions and initiatives involved in the event. According to the Impact Plan of our project, we also held two public outreach events in London, co-organised by the Romanian, Polish and Austrian Cultural Institutes, which attracted considerable public interest (ca. 80 visitors at the first, ca. 40 visitors at the second event), including substantial discussion and requests for further similar events (see, e.g., http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/octombrie2016.pdf, pp. 7-9)</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CA55CD61-629B-46C8-B40C-BADE43DB37E5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>- Overall, the project challenges existing views and perceived patterns of collective identity. This has important social and political implications. Cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious hybridity in various forms is a frequent fact in East-Central Europe's recent history and its legacies. Generally, it is a frequent fact in many other parts of the world too. However, 'sub-cultural' identities of this kind are often unrecognised, denied or stigmatised. For attempts at practically challenging this, cf. Narrative Impact. The project's main scholarly achievements are as follows:
- The project creates significant new knowledge. The notion of 'sub-cultures' as specific forms of hybrid, mixed identity in national, ethnic, religious and linguistic terms fills a crucial gap in our understanding of East-Central Europe and its recent history.
- The project has opened up important new research questions. Numerous constituencies in East-Central European societies cannot be understood through the prevailing prism of national, ethnic, religious, linguistic homogeneity. This has raised the important question of how these constituencies can be understood, and whether this understanding translates into other contexts, beyond East-Central Europe.
- The project substantially increases research capability. East-Central Europe, i.e. the lands between Germany and Russia, is large, but generally understudied. The project has created an active international network, including scholars from the region itself. It fosters expertise in this area in the UK.
- An important project finding is that mixed identities do not 'automatically' arise in multi-ethnic settings. They are contingent on specific local, often socio-economic conditions under which forming a collective hybrid 'sub-culture' may be advantageous or necessary.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project is creating a diverse international network of institutions and researchers interested in mixed identities and in East-Central Europe. The project engages members of this far-reaching network with each other by way of a succession of workshops, seminars and publication projects. It is expected that the notion of 'sub-cultures' will continue to shape the research agenda of participants of the network in the UK and internationally.
The project engages select cultural policy makers, activists and diplomatic representatives from the region, where the paradigm of national, ethnic, religious and linguistic homogeneity has been prevalent, and the source of recurrent conflict. Historical legacies, on the other hand, are precisely the reverse, with numerous forms of 'sub-cultural' national, ethnic, religious and linguistic mixing. Engaging these partners contributes to topical ongoing political discussions in the region. These should ultimately influence local policy decisions, the programming and delivery of local cultural and social grassroot initiatives.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CAFD4C01-2B4A-4703-8EE0-2D197DA35DEE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://subcultures.mml.ox.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution to an exhibition catalogue</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1108489B-109D-4069-B9FD-CA43AB6711DF</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.zacheta.art.pl/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Romanian, Polish and Austrian Cultural Institutes</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E944F335-F0F6-40B1-B6C7-708893B059F8</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.icr-london.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D2302226-74C4-4F57-9D0D-BF0D32E708B1"><gtr:id>D2302226-74C4-4F57-9D0D-BF0D32E708B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Place, Borderland and Elective Affinities: Contemporary Polish Identity in Post-1945 Lviv, between &amp;quot;Minority&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Subculture&amp;quot;</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ab Imperio</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b872ff1661d51c45685229890c23172c"><gtr:id>b872ff1661d51c45685229890c23172c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pyrah R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A45B6DB7-D4EA-4EEB-87F4-C375B21D50DD"><gtr:id>A45B6DB7-D4EA-4EEB-87F4-C375B21D50DD</gtr:id><gtr:title>[Seven Essays on Austrian identity narratives in historical context]</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ba7214d47215e2f9e2f8c77d37495c7c"><gtr:id>ba7214d47215e2f9e2f8c77d37495c7c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mishka, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-963-7326-51-6</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/22FD86B9-DB62-4CE0-9FBD-78857A2B3A7B"><gtr:id>22FD86B9-DB62-4CE0-9FBD-78857A2B3A7B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Discourses of Collective Identity in Central and Eastern Europe: Antimodernism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ecf04314e1d6c73fdde666787f231fd0"><gtr:id>ecf04314e1d6c73fdde666787f231fd0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mishkova, M, Turda, M and Trencsenyi, B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-963-7326-62-2</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9904E95C-3B0E-46D7-AFAC-E6F781F4BE01"><gtr:id>9904E95C-3B0E-46D7-AFAC-E6F781F4BE01</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Polish-Ukrainian mixed variety of pre-WW II Lviv: A 'sur?yk' of the past?
