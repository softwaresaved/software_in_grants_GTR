Intercultural understanding suggests capacity for appreciating, recognising and relating to different world viewpoints and experiences. Historical and empirical research recognises the role arts and cultural objects and expressions, like fine and performing arts and heritage, play in political, cultural and ethnic relations. Yet, little is known about the role of arts and cultural managers, and their practice and education, in this process.

In fact, arts and cultural managers shape and structure intercultural exchange. They direct and administer arts and cultural projects between nations, and devise, plan and develop arts and cultural programming to attract and include growing migrant populations as audiences, participants and creators within nations. Global, cultural, post colonial, and intercultural studies show that mechanisms for fostering or hindering intercultural understanding are often based on long standing terminology, institutional structures, and habits upheld by practices and pedagogies within specific professions.

We will integrate and apply this research to the traditions, institutions and actions of arts and cultural management to extend awareness of the part arts and cultural managers play in intercultural exchange with 5 goals:
- Gather international, multidisciplinary researchers with arts and cultural management practitioners, policymakers, educators and students to share knowledge and uncover new areas of research about intercultural understanding in arts and cultural management education and practice 
- Learn how arts and cultural management practitioners, policymakers, educators and students perceive and experience intercultural exchange within international arenas of practice and education 
- Apply new disciplines (e.g. ethnic, historical, postcolonial, global, intercultural, and cultural studies) to these perspectives to examine dominant terminology, structures and traditions shaping arts and cultural management practice and education
- Share findings, bibliography, documentation widely to students, practitioners, educators, policymakers and researchers to foster policy impact, further study and networking
- Enable new research examining intercultural work in arts and cultural management

Free talks for an audience of 100 and interactive, focused, multidisciplinary workshops for 40 (10 core network members with researchers, students, policymakers, artists, managers) will occur via 4 seminars: 
1. Framing Art and Cultural Management: relationship of management of arts and culture to globalisation, internationalisation, and migration (Heilbronn Uni, Kunzelsau, Jan 2017)
2. Dominant Ideologies: Examining Institutions, Habits and Terminology in the Profession (QUB, Apr 2017)
3. Intercultural Relations in Arts/Cultural Management Higher Education, (Macromedia Uni Berlin, Jul 2017)
4. Intercultural Relations in Practice (Free Word Centre, London, Nov 2017)
Seminar 5, Moving Forward: Critical Discourse for Intercultural Understanding in Arts/Cultural Management (QUB, Jan 2018), enables review and reflection for core members

Advisory Committee guidance and open call on affiliate websites and listservs will assist promotion. To ensure knowledge exchange across disciplines, seminar findings and documentation with network database, participant reflections, and bibliography will be shared on the network website and promoted through posts on affiliate network sites. The PI and Co-I will author
- Policy briefing on interculturalism in the arts/cultural sector for Arts/Cultural councils, UNESCO, Ministerial Depts (NI/Germany/Romania)
- Academic journal articles, papers in academic and sector conferences 
- Edited publication of research from the network
Curriculum insights will be examined in core member BA/MA programmes</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Arts and Cultural Policymakers working in intercultural exchange: those from State Ministerial Departments, Arts Councils and cross-border agencies, e.g. the British Council, the Goethe Institut, and EU Cultural Contact Points. They engage with 2 areas of work related to intercultural exchange. One is the development, design and funding of policies and projects for building intercultural understanding between nations. The other is the development, design and funding of policies and projects to promote intercultural exchange between ethnic groups within nations. This activity often emphasises supporting and enhancing culturally diverse arts audiences, artists and productions within nations. 

The network will be a forum gathering international policymakers with managers, students, educators, artists, and researchers to critically explore case studies that reveal the potential and difficulties emerging from this practice in the sector. It will raise awareness for arts and cultural policymakers about the role of their agencies and policies in influencing intercultural exchanges at the practice level. It is hoped this improved knowledge will benefit development of future policies that are responsive to the unique context of intercultural exchange in arts and cultural management. 

2. Arts and cultural organisations, managers and public sector workers are directly involved in devising, delivering and administering intercultural activities. By developing research in this area, the network will provide them a physical and conceptual 'space' to share experiences and engage in critical reflection with policymakers, students, educators, artists, and researchers as well as those working in similar roles but from different nations and ethnic groups. Together, they will consider the assumptions and traditions that inform the decisions managers make within intercultural exchanges in order to better understand, and hopefully address, issues of structure and agency within their practice. It is envisioned that this will have a secondary and longer term benefit for improving the opportunity and conditions for creative and cultural expression for artists.

3. Arts and cultural management educators and students. Focusing on the relationship of practice to education, the network will build awareness of how higher education institutes might prepare students for work in an increasingly intercultural and transnational sector. Existing studies acknowledge demand within the sector for greater understanding of the intercultural arts and cultural management landscape-networks, international laws, traditions, ideologies and practices-to address skill gaps supporting professional development and employability. The network will provide occasion for students and educators to develop this area of work as well as wider critical awareness of intercultural working.

Also, with the internationalisation of higher education having a direct impact on student demographics in arts and cultural management programmes, there are new opportunities and challenges for intercultural learning and exchange in these classrooms. The network will provide opportunities to explore these issues in more detail during the Education seminar. Students and educators will have new ideas to apply to curriculum. 

A dissemination plan will ensure impact is achieved: a database of participants to facilitate further networking and project development; a policy briefing document developed by the PI and Co-I regarding cultural policies for interculturalism within the arts and cultural sector. The network website will be updated with case studies; interviews and audio-visual documentation from seminars, members, and participants; and reflections from feedback on application of curriculum ideas in the classroom. The PI and Co-I will compile an edited volume offering analysis and emerging issues aimed at a research and education audience and 2 academic journal articles.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39773</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P005128/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
