Behaviour</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/P008976/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Changes in the domain and complexity of consumer decision making raise key challenges for modern societies. Increasingly governments transfer responsibility for complex decisions away from the state towards the individual. The decline of state provision of social insurance and financial security has seen very important decisions, such as over retirement saving and personal protection insurance, become the responsibility of consumers, just as more familiar but often also highly complex decisions are. This project will drive forward scientific understanding of consumer behaviour in the face of difficult choices and of how public policy can intervene most effectively to promote their success.

The modern consumer faces decisions of bewildering complexity, with choices to be made between numerous options differing from one another in multiple ways. Consider e.g. all the specifications of mobile phone and new car available in typical modern economies, and all the different pension schemes or insurance products. Besides the number and complexity of the options, consumers face uncertainty e.g. about reliability, service quality or resale value. Even when a great deal of information is available, it may be framed by firms or suppliers in ways intended to induce particular customer responses e.g. via complex utility tariffs or terms and conditions for financial products. Many choices involve consideration of costs and benefits spread over time, e.g. lifestyle and savings decisions, or large consumer durable purchases.

Decades of research in behavioural science and psychology, and recent developments in behavioural economics, show that many individuals find even quite simple decisions difficult, are not always consistent, and often behave in ways reflecting biased or poor decision processes. The results can be highly detrimental to consumers concerned and, sometimes, to wider society.

Our research programme, drawing on economics and psychology and at the cutting edge of interdisciplinary behavioural science, will advance understanding of consumer behaviour. Theme 1 will study foundations of individual choice, with particular attention to decision processes and consumers' responses to features of their environment. Theme 2 will examine how firms frame and structure environments for actual and potential customers in the light of behavioural characteristics of consumers of varying sophistication. It will focus on how firms' strategies affect and are in turn affected by competition between firms. Understanding this interaction is vital to successful regulation of consumer markets. Theme 2 will also study the form of appropriate regulation directly, in collaboration with UK regulatory bodies. Theme 3 will apply lessons of behavioural science to personal and household financial decision making - an area of consumer behaviour that typifies the combination of choice between multiple, complex products; uncertainty; time; and potential for serious consumer detriment. 

The work will be carried out by a team that is built out of, and develops, the existing Network for Behavioural Science, the hub of which is a partnership between leading behavioural science groups at the Universities of Nottingham, East Anglia and Warwick. The team will include world-renowned psychologists and economists, emerging scientists and team members with direct experience of consumer market regulation. The team will conduct and publicise research that achieves international academic recognition through publication in top-flight scientific journals and conferences. It will enhance the consumer environment for citizens by influencing policy formulation and consumer market regulation in the UK. By creating new data sets, training and nurturing researchers, and fostering an international research network with links between academics, the private sector and policy makers, the project will increase the research capacity of UK universities in behavioural science.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The overarching aim of our proposal for continuation of the Network for Integrated Behavioural Science (NIBS) is to enhance the understanding of consumer behaviour and the well-being of individuals by improving decision making, the performance of markets, and policy and regulatory interventions in them.

Behavioural science offers transformative insights into how consumers make decisions, how firms respond to consumers, and what regulators and policy makers can do to improve decision making and the functioning of markets. Since its inception, NIBS has been at the forefront of translating academic research in behavioural science into policy-relevant applications. The structure of our future research plan is again to develop foundations and apply them, with the latter a major emphasis of our new research themes. There is scope for wide ranging application of our work across all themes but, given the scale of the project, we prioritise two of the most important areas here: financial decision making and competition policy. 

We will expand the scope for influence of our research by developing new links with regulators and industry, forming collaborations with the Centre for Competition Policy and welcoming co-researchers on to the grant who hold Non-Executive Director roles at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the new cross-governmental UK Competition Network. These new project members bring the highest-level partnership with regulators and very extensive experience of bringing behavioural insights to bear on regulatory thinking across the UK policy environment.

We will also develop new ways of working which strengthen interaction and co-production of work with the research user community, by allocating time of post-doctoral research fellows to collaboration with the FCA's Behavioural Economics and Data Science Team, led by Dr Stefan Hunt. We see dedicated postdoctoral appointments as an ideal catalyst for increased collaboration. Postdoctoral fellows will hold academic research positions at NIBS institutions and spend a significant share of their time on location at the FCA, sitting within the FCA team.

We have developed collaborations with behavioural economics and data science groups within industry. One initiative involves collaboration with the data science team in a UK retail bank, a large player in the asset management industry with a 25% market share of privately managed asset portfolios in the UK, who have provided detailed asset trade data together with matched behavioural data from surveys. NIBS researchers have also developed a collaboration with the UK credit card sector and have combined transaction-level records for 1.8 million UK card holders from five credit card companies.

Our research will also inform and influence industry practices. Emerging research suggests that firms may be able to exploit the cognitive and behavioural biases of consumers. The possible resulting need for regulatory intervention provides the context for exciting and much needed future research work. The response of firms to 'behavioural consumers' is a focus of policy interest stressed in recent FCA studies (e.g. of the credit card market) and in other market studies (such as the CMA's Retail Banking Market Investigation).

NIBS researchers will continue to exploit the full scope of potential impacts, building on existing and new pathways, including statutory routes (consultation responses and presentations), expert advisory work and testimony, keynote addresses and contributions to public policy fora. We also seek new horizons of international impact, with a partnership with Gallup to investigate behavioural science issues worldwide. This collaboration has scope to achieve significant impact through dissemination of research findings through the news media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2038443</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P008976/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19539613-8143-4CD6-B1E5-0C7B93D08B7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural &amp; experimental eco</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
