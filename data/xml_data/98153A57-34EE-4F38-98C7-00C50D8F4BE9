This has been especially the case over the last decade. Irving Kristol, eminence grise of American neoconservatism, referred to Thucydides' history as 'the favourite neoconservative text on foreign affairs', since it features heavily in the writings of theorists like Hans Morgenthau and Leo Strauss. An even more pervasive influence is the historian Donald Kagan: father of one of the co-founders of the Project for a New American Century, a signatory of the original declaration along with such figures as Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz, and co-author of the wake-up call While America Sleeps, a work shaped by his reading of Thucydides. At the other end of the spectrum of Republican thought, no profile of Colin Powell is complete without reference to the quotation that hung on his office wall as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs - 'Of all manifestations of power, restraint impresses men most' - a legacy of the place of Thucydides in the curriculum at West Point as at other US military training establishments like the Naval War College. The recent travails of the neoconservative project and the return of the Democrats to power have led not to the rejection of Thucydides as a source of political wisdom but to calls for more careful readings of key episodes - the Sicilian expedition is read as confirming the inevitability of the debacle in Iraq - as the grounding for a different approach to international affairs.\n\nIt is easy to dismiss the Thucydides of the American neoconservatives as the product of a na&amp;iuml;ve, partial and dehistoricised reading of the text - or, more likely, to judge from the limited range of reference of many discussions, of a few isolated passages in it. However, this misses the point: the idea of Thucydides, however far removed it may be from a complex reality, has continuing power and currency shaping ideas about how the modern world should be run and serving to legitimise them. This is not a new phenomenon; Thucydides played a prominent role in debates about inter-state relations even before Thomas Hobbes - himself generally dismissive of the wisdom of the ancients, but devoted translator of the History of the Peloponnesian War. Moreover, study of the history of his reception makes it clear that Thucydides the Neoconservative is not the only version with the power to influence debates; Thucydides the Political Theorist is quite as important in the analysis of the workings of democracy and demagoguery, the ideas and ideals of citizenship; Thucydides the Strategist has influenced military and naval thinking since the early modern period; and Thucydides the Model Historian dominated the development of 'history as science' under Leopold von Ranke in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe perspective changes significantly over time: as each of these conceptions influences the others; as the valuation of Thucydides relative to rivals like Tacitus or Herodotus changes; as scholarship develops knowledge of the text and its context; and as conceptions of the relationship between ancient and modern are transformed by the experiences of modernisation. In the nineteenth century, classical history lost its privileged status as a source of exempla, but, unlike other ancient historians, Thucydides continued to be read outside schools and universities: like Plato and Aristotle, he was seen as offering universal insights and precepts that transcended his time. However, even at a given moment the idea of Thucydides was never simple or straightforward; he could equally well be cited as a democrat or an anti-democrat, an activist or a quietist, a realist or an idealist, the archetypal scientific historian or the exemplary practitioner of rhetoric. The aim of this project is to explore the different aspects of Thucydides' reception and continuing influence.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>512804</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Free University of Berlin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Friedrich Meinecke Institute (FMI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Lessons of War: Thucydides 1914-45</gtr:description><gtr:id>8BDA42D7-48AC-4EAD-BA0B-4B988DDA6F0F</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Collaborative project developed with the Freie Universitaet Berlin; application submitted for major research grant, and further applications and joint events planned.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Reading</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Legacy of Greek Political Thought Network</gtr:department><gtr:description>Legacy of Greek Political Thought</gtr:description><gtr:id>1503D7A6-19BB-445F-89BA-EFCA55BCE296</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>New international research network (http://www.reading.ac.uk/classics/research/class-LegGPT.aspx); Neville Morley has been invited to join as a founder member.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Free University of Berlin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Friedrich Meinecke Institute (FMI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Einstein Visiting Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:id>CFBD9E21-A6C5-4337-9038-0CB924807AAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Just started; will be speaking in co-organised panel session at the Deutsche Historikertag in Hamburg in September.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Einstein Foundation provides up to 12,000 EUR per annum for expenses in travelling to and staying in Berlin, as well as other visits for research purposes and to attend relevant conferences with my collaborators; they also provide administrative support for the project and for a range of outreach activities.

Thucydides is traditionally seen as a historian, and is often put forward as the inventor of critical, even 'scientific' history - a modern before modernity; however, while his work has been an ideal and inspiration for many historians, especially up until the First World War, it also raises troubling questions for our understanding of the nature and usefulness of history, that continue to be debated. Meanwhile, Thucydides has also been seen as the founder of political theory, or of the particular tradition of political thought known as 'Realism'; again, it is possible to see how these readings of Thucydides, and the elevation of him to an authority, have shaped modern ideas about global politics, the nature of democracy and the power of rhetoric - but also raise important issues about the ways that political theorists and commentators on global affairs make use of historical data in the arguments. Thucydides has become an all-purpose authority, evoked to explain all manner of contemporary issues from US-China relations and the possibility of World War III to the factionalism of modern politics and the dynamics of the Greek economic crisis. In each instance, he is treated as a straightforward figure - as someone who is *clearly* a historian or *clearly* a political theorist - whose ideas are clear and persuasive - without any reference to the complexity of his reception in different fields, which the project has now revealed.

In brief, we have shown that Thucydides is always more complicated and elusive, and always more interesting and provocative, than the modern scholars who seek to draw on his authority for their own purposes. His work is 'good to think with', if this complexity is recognised and embraced.

The project has produced a multi-author Handbook to the Reception of Thucydides', which offers an indispensable guide to the different aspects of his influence, from history and political theory to parliamentary debates and literature, written by a range of international authorities. It has also produced a series of more specialised studies, with a book on 'Thucydides and the Idea of History' and a series of articles on the reception of Thucydides in literature, political theory, and global politics. The two PhD students on the project have produced ground-breaking work on the role of Thucydides in modern military education and on his place in 17th and 18th century political debates, above all around the nature of the British and French empires. The Primary Investigator has also founded a blog on which he continues to explore the contemporary influence of Thucydides for a non-academic audience (see http://thesphinxblog.com).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As noted above, the project revealed hitherto-neglected or -ignored traditions of the reception and influence of Thucydides, which merit detailed investigation: future projects could profitably explore Thucydidean traditions within areas of political theory and the social sciences beyond mainstream IR theory and political thought, and could also focus on the military tradition - the PhD by Stradis, one member of the project team, on modern professional military eduction, has only scratched the surface here.

Our findings so far have shed important light on the way that Thucydides' ideas, and ideas attributed to Thucydides, continue to influence conceptions of history, the use of historical data within the social sciences, and numerous debates around contemporary global politics - most recently, the evocation of the Melian Dialogue in discussions of the Greek economic crisis and of the Ukraine crisis, the use of the Corcyrean stasis both in debates about Syria and in the analysis of current UK and US political struggles, and the new concept of the 'Thucydides Trap' in relation to US-China relations and ongoing security issues. Our findings reveal the roots, and the unexamined assumptions, of these debates, and point to more fruitful ways of employing Thucydides as a basis for understanding issues of power, war and violence.

As well as enriching and correcting discussions in the media and within policy forums and think-tanks, we envisage that our findings can support the development of Thucydides as a resource for understanding complexity and conflict, which would be useful not only in schools and community groups but potentially within the military - following the ways in which it has been used within US professional military education, especially the Naval War College.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9D7EC28A-D2F2-488F-8336-BEC147676545</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government,
