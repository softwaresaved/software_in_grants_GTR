Generation Networks Systems and Services</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/G049939/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This UK-India consortium-based initiative has been established in direct response to a previous request from the British High Commission in India. The IU-ATC consortium has developed through a series of workshops supported by EPSRC and the British High Commission in India, commencing with a Technical Workshop in January/February 2006. The consortium comprises 8 research-leading universities in UK, 5 leading IITs, major industrial partners in UK and India (including companies such as BT, InfoSys, Wipro, Sasken, and Tejas), and a number of SMEs. The initiative aims to establish the first virtual India-UK Advanced Technology Centre (IU-ATC) in Next Generation Networks, Systems and Services, which will put in place the support infrastructure to facilitate, develop and enable the Digital Economy of both countries. This will be achieved through scientific investigation of the technical and functional requirements of Next Generation Networks through the promotion of industry collaboration with research-leading academic institutions and government departments as part of an initial 30 month Phase 1 of an overall 5-year joint programme between the UK and India. The current proposal builds on the existing and well formed consortium, which has already attracted EPSRC support (Travel Grant GR1, INTERACT 5 GR2), UKTI Grant, GOF, and most recently UKIERI-DST Research Award (S083). The explosive growth in advanced telecommunication networks and multimedia services in the last decade has offered exciting opportunities across a wide range of sectors, including communications, education, entertainment, and health. These opportunities have been successfully embraced within Europe and USA, and there is an increasing need to provide similar opportunities for the rapidly expanding economy of India. However, given India's special requirements, this cannot easily be achieved by transference of existing technical and engineering solutions, and a fundamental rethink is required to adapt or develop novel solutions and provide for research, innovation and wealth creation opportunities between UK and India. The IU-ATC initiative is focused on promotion of the Digital Economy, a priority identified under the recent government Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 . The Digital Economy aims to support research and skilled people to effect early adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by a variety of user sectors. Understanding and enabling the impact of information, better positions the UK and India to reap the economic and social benefits offered by emerging Telecommunications Engineering hardware and software together with fixed/wireless/mobile Broadband technologies for low cost sensor and user devices, and service delivery platforms. The challenges in exploiting the promise of the technological advances within NGNs, and achieving their potential performance, economic and social returns, require not only a thorough understanding of the lower layers of the communications networking stack but also a strong ability and interest in exploiting the core technologies for citizen-facing applications. This often implies an appreciation of business and government strategies in specific areas such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing and management and requires close collaboration between academia and industry to realise the full potential.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>326070</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>340297</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>RCs</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/J016691/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>406F9329-1426-4D91-BF36-89EC1F9452FC</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>21650</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Queen Mary, University of London&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>GPF 12-126</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>1AA609A8-E36E-4C79-BDEB-F57D115712B8</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Top five impact highlights arising from the project

The project investigated and developed novel solutions for integrated access, adaptable service delivery, and alternative infrastructure and management solutions to support communication to and from citizens and emergency personnel, though a rapidly deployable communication system. The theme took into account the different challenges that UK and India face in providing next generation communication systems and the hugely variable communication coverage. The top key findings arising from the project are:

1. QMUL: A Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) test bed for emergency situations was implemented providing real node discovery and fully automated selection of wireless medium for transmission. The show case used real equipments (laptops and mobile phones) communicating in a DTN ad hoc fashion in different networks. Nokia N-810, Android phones and laptops were used to communicate via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The adaptive service provision implemented allowed civilians and rescue teams to communicate and exchange texts, images, and voice. 

2. QMUL: Energy efficiency investigation for DTN mobile app: The effects of multiple radio access, routing algorithm and application activity on energy efficiency were investigated, the energy efficiency and the message delivery performance based on the collected data from test mobile phones were analysed to reduce battery drainage of the mobile devices and hence extend operational lifetime.

3. QMUL: Location estimation with cluster in emergency situation using intersection method for outdoor environment: The improved intersection method is present to find the most likely intersection area of the more than three base stations (BSs) circles in geographical spaces to compute user's location and compared with the common existing localization approaches.

4. QMUL: A signal strength based media access scheme for OFDMA based mobile ad hoc networks was extended. It can distribute allocate sub-channels among mobile users to avoid co-channel interference and reduce the signalling overhead. Based on the proposed media access scheme, a QoS on demand routing protocol has been proposed to provide a cross layer solution for concurrent transmissions to further improve the system throughput. To make the proposed cross layer routing protocol more feasible, a null subcarrier based frequency and partial time synchronization scheme is proposed to support implementing OFDMA in mobile ad hoc networks.

5. Infosys: A Proxy-based Fast Pre-Authentication Protocol has been designed based on EAP-TLS. The method enhances existing EAP-TLS based pre-authentication scheme to deliver improved and consistent performance (in terms of handoff latency) even under extreme congestion conditions A patent for the fast pre-authentication protocol has been filed.

6. CEWiT: Context-aware, Policy-Driven Service Adaptation Framework: The key outcome is a model to enable intelligent adaptation of content based on inputs from different contexts - network, device and user. Even if the handover is seamless, when switching from one type of access to another, there is no guarantee that the same Quality of Service (QoS) can be provided to the user. It is important to ensure that the degradation in service experienced by the user is managed gracefully and an acceptable quality of service (QoS) perceived by a user is sustained. A patent was filed for the content adaptation platform developed in the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Android application and server implemented in the content adaptation platform has been used for the National Program for Technology-Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) in India. As part of NPTEL, the Indian Institutes of Technology provide video recording of lectures to students in two formats (one with high transmission rate and the other with a low transmission rate). However, the students must choose the format. With the content adaptation platform an automated content adaptation is performed on the fly that adapts the quality and transmission rate of the video depending on the user device and access network the user (student) is at that moment.

The real emergency DTN can be used in many different emergency situations where infrastructure communications (Cellular telephony or Wi-Fi) are temporary or permanently unavailable. 

Dr John Bigham performed consultancy in Message Oriented Middleware (June 2011) for IP Group plc in the city of London on the future of message oriented middleware and investment in particular middleware software.
 The rapidly deployable communication system for emergencies: to develop a generic out-of the box solution for similar circumstances in a mountain area. Consultation and collaborative development with the immediate community of the area could be sought to allow the use of the smart phones in emergencies. This could be extended to local government as well as district and local stakeholders with a view to future development of a generic template.

The content adaptation platform: to be used for the National Program for Technology-Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) in India, allowing automated content adaptation on the fly that adapts the quality and transmission rate of the video depending on the user device and access network the student is at that moment.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0740BC6B-8AF5-48C2-9D52-4EFE223291A9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including
