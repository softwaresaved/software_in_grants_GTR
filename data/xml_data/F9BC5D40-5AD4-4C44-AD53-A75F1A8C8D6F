The event was of huge international significance and continues to be relevant to the study of British social and industrial history and modernist architecture. In 2006, the British Empire Exhibition, Glasgow 1938 project (run by Glasgow School of Art's Digital Design Studio) produced a well-researched and constructed, photo-real, 3D model of the over 100 principal buildings and structures that comprised the Exhibition together with an accurate 3D map showing the relationship of the various buildings, road and pathways and water features, to the topography of Bellahouston Park. This project also created an archive of related cultural assets and video interviews recording opinions of experts in the fields of architecture and architectural history as well as the recollections of members of the public who attended the Exhibition in 1938.

The primary aims of this project, Research Engagement through Virtual Immersive Tools for Learning (REVISIT Learning) are to transform the results of The British Empire Exhibition, Glasgow 1938 into innovative learning tools which are specifically targeted to school-age learners in terms of both age and curriculum, to make these learning tools as widely accessible as possible, and to increase our understanding of the impact of immersive learning tools for teachers and learners through a pilot study. This is a brand new group of users who are highly appropriate to share in the genuinely eye-opening and exciting results from previous British Empire Exhibition research. Existing 3D and 2D digital objects will be highlighted and explored, specifically targeting relevant curriculum areas (including both history and technology) for classes of students who will have the opportunity to not only interactively engage with the learning tools at various pedagogically-robust levels, but to also produce and contribute their own creative responses to the learning tools. This learning methodology not only addresses key curriculum areas (e.g. emphasis on technology skills development) but provides (and, crucially, tests) a creative, non-didactic mode of engaging young learners with 3D research data.

Project activities will build on ongoing collaboration with a selection of schools and teachers in order to define the areas of most relevance and educational need. The project outputs are intended to not only fulfil a defined need in education (that is, the creation of 3D immersive learning environments that meaningfully and appropriately engage young learners) but to inspire further learning activities in creative response to the research findings being communicated.

REVISIT Learning has a number of major outcomes, with strong implications for pedagogy, cultural interpretation, and creative engagement. The learning tools will not only extend the value and learning opportunities of the original AHRC-funded research to a brand new audience, they will do so in a way that is directly relevant to, and satisfies a clearly expressed need from, the schools. The 3D immersive tools provide teachers and learners with ongoing, free, public access to these learning opportunities - and, importantly, the tools will be editable so can easily be adapted to satisfy the learning outcomes of different age groups and subjects. Adding creative learning activities also allows educators to themselves have a much more creative approach, offering opportunities for school-wide project-based learning and collaboration between different classes of students. The free provision of learning tools through an open, editable delivery system encourages a wide range of continuing uses and will help to embed the use of innovative 3D data-facilitated learning into educational policy and practice, and will also create impact for learners outside the school system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>REVISIT Learning will create significant benefits for a number of different stakeholders. The direct, immediate beneficiaries will be the teachers and students in our partner schools who will have the opportunity to co-design the learning objects during the project, experience them first-hand, and provide feedback for their improvement. Engagement with the learning tools is suitable for both single-user exploration (e.g. by teachers, parents, or individual students) but, more importantly, embeds the experience of the Exhibition firmly in the collective, discursive, social, creative environment of a guided lesson or workshop. 

The focussed dissemination activities in the latter part of the project are actively designed to aid the embedding of the 3D immersive learning tools in the wider teaching community, expanding beyond individual schools to the wider educational community across the UK and beyond. Making the project outputs widely, freely available for at least 5 years after the project ends ensures longer-term access for any school, learner, or parent and publicising the project results through channels focussed specifically at teachers and learners will promote their widespread use (e.g. Open Educational Resource websites such as TES Connect, Jorum, and STEMNET, and education and learning technology conferences and exhibitions such as the Association for Learning Technology, British Education Research Association, and/or British Educational Training and Technology conferences). The tools will be available globally, however our dissemination efforts will focus on resources and events aimed specifically at UK teachers and learners, as this is considered to be the project's primary audience.

This activity will be reinforced by the results of the evaluation study. This proposal does not aim to provide rich, immersive learning tools and simply expect them to be successful. The learning methodology will be rigorously evaluated as part of REVISIT's core activity, with early results incorporated as improvements into the learning tools before final release. This activity provides a strong evidence base for the value of our chosen approach in terms of engagement, enjoyment, and efficacy of the learning activities. These results will contribute significantly to understanding of the impact of immersive learning tools, and will either validate the project's approach as robust or identify areas for improvement in delivery of 3D research materials in a school context, at both specific and policy levels. This project outcome will have specific impact in educational research within Higher Education but also on understanding of technology and learning methodologies at all levels (e.g. primary schools, secondary, FE, and lifelong learning). It also provides a firm evidence base on which future designers of learning tools incorporating 3D models and/or co-creation activities can build.

Of course, REVISIT Learning will also increase awareness and use of the original research project website, itself a powerful digital resource for igniting interest in and exploration of the fascinating material related to the British Empire Exhibition of 1938 (http://www.empireexhibition.com/). This resource benefits a wide variety of communities from local history enthusiasts to international scholars of urban exhibitions and, more widely, architecture, history, and social sciences. In addition to increased use of the original project website, we also anticipate an increase in visitors to the permanent exhibition for the Empire Exhibition 1938, at the popular tourist site House for an Art Lover (HAL) on the original site of the exhibition in Glasgow. By using appropriate outreach (e.g. Tourist Office, Doors Open Day, GSA and HAL publicity, and our existing relationships with print and broadcast media organisations) this will reach beyond members of the public with a specific interest in the Exhibition or Glasgow's history and into general tourism.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74555</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>keynote talk on data preservation through re-use with the REVISIT project - (Wellcome Library/DPC conference, London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>83AF9FF5-5631-4E55-832F-90D6AED806D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a keynote presentation to information professionals across multiple domains, museum, library, heritage, and industry.

The project team has taken every opportunity to disseminate both the academic findings of the REVISIT project, the project evaluation methodology and the project tools to as wide a non-academic audience as possible. This has included professional practitioners from the education, architecture, museums &amp;amp; galleries and heritage sectors. Presentations have been given at a number of national and international conferences primarily or largely attended by professional audiences e.g. the International Symposium for Evaluating Digital Cultural Resources and the International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation. In addition to a conference proceedings article and a academic journal article (in prep.) an article for a professional publication (TES) is also in prep. An unexpected, but significant, impact has been in the field of digital preservation where long-standing positions on preservation through re-use have been challenged as a result of the project outcomes, specifically this relates to the approach of archiving 3D outputs separately form other forms of digital data stripping them of contextual information, REVISIT has demonstrated that a key re-use requirement for co-production is easy and logical access to meaningful amounts of contextual information about the object being modeled. While this was achieved successfully with the REVISIT British Empire Exhibition model it was not straightforward, and even the project's access to this material is an unusual case. Changes in professional archival practice would be required to make easy connections between 3D data and contextual/archival material the norm.

The longer term policy/practice outcomes for both participating schools and other interested schools/learners is too early to gauge yet as this impact will not be apparent until later in this school year. However, the REVISIT outputs and methodology have been the foundation of a new proposed collaboration between the School of Simulation and Visualisation at the Glasgow School of Art and the Glasgow City Council digital learning team. This proposal would see REVISIT based digital co-production projects being rolled out across multiple schools within the city having a direct impact on both policy and educational practice. This new collaboration also has a strong evaluation aspect that will allow GSA researchers to further elaborate the benefits of the REVISIT approach as well as identifying further barriers to uptake.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DC2C2720-7CA2-4FCC-A4C5-365B0669286F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through the REVISIT project a range of perceived benefits and opportunities were reported across the three school based case studies that directly addressed the original research question posed by the project. These were largely associated with the potential of virtual 3D models to facilitate rich learner engagement as well as the possibility to explore, manipulate and construct virtual objects. Additionally, engagement with the 3D virtual model was seen by students and teachers alike to promote cognitive aspects of learning as well as enhance student interest and motivation. In line with the findings of Dawley and Dede (2014) the opportunity to co-create and share highly personalised digital artefacts such as their own virtual tours was also welcomed by the students across all case studies. Furthermore, most students acknowledged that their sense of presence within the virtual world played an important role and enhanced their learning experiences which would have been less rich had they only drawn on text, images or video. Online, embodied, social presence was not a feature offered by the BEE 3D model and VSim software and therefore an investigation into presence did not form part the research, but this would be a fruitful avenue for future research activity. Even so,it is clear that there is both an expectation and a desire for a more embodied experience when navigating the 3D model. 

Within a wider institutional context, it appeared that the flexibility and freedom the schools were allowed as to how they could utilise the virtual 3D model to best fit their classroom practices was doubled-edged in its outcomes. While for St Nicholas this led to a more creative use of the tool to inform the curriculum in meaningful ways as well as a range of relevant student classroom activities for the other two schools this resulted in more limited and often compromised engagement. The study's findings also indicate a sharp contrast between primary and secondary school settings with regard to the customisability of the National Curriculum. Notably the primary school classroom allowed for greater flexibility and could accommodate more creative practices compared to the more rigid and outcome-driven secondary curriculum. 

Whilst some teachers felt there was real value in engaging with the model and providing a break from their usual teaching routines, other teachers had concerns about the lack of fit with their subject area, the time made available to them to prepare, and hinted that their only reason for engaging with the project was due to senior management pressure. Other challenges that emerged related to the availability and the cost of having robust hardware and internet connectivity. It must also be noted that other perceived barriers identified across the three case studies were the pedagogical skills needed for creating relevant and meaningful tasks in virtual worlds and the time to plan and design these tasks. All the above findings are discussed in detail in current project publications or publications in prep. In addition the evaluation methodology developed for the REVISIT project has itself been promulgated via events such as the International Symposium on Evaluating Digital Cultural Resources (noted under engagement activities). The project activities and outputs have directly led to impact in the practice of Glasgow City Council's digital learning group who are currently working with project partners to roll out REVISIT methodology based digital learning programmes across multiple schools.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>REVISIT Learning has a number of major outcomes, with strong implications for pedagogy, cultural interpretation, and creative engagement.
