Specifically we aim to provide pharmacological tools to elucidate the mechanisms by which one nerve cell (neuron) communicates with others in the brain. This communication is effected at the junctions (synapses) between neurons. Our previous work has helped to establish that one of the main mechanisms by which one cell in a neuronal chain or network communicates with the next cell is by releasing an amino acid, glutamate from its multiple synaptic endings. This amino acid flows across the synaptic gap to the next neuron and there interacts with a protein (glutamate receptor) situated on the surface of the next neuron, to produce electrochemical and/or biochemical changes that control the electrical activity of the second cell. We have helped establish that glutamate can interact with a family of structurally related proteins known as glutamate receptor subtypes each performing different functions in the central nervous system. The present work aims to synthesize chemicals (pharmacological tools) that block the action of glutamate at particular glutamate receptor subtypes that are activated by the natural product kainic acid (kainate receptors). Kainate receptors are tetramers made up of a combination of protein subunits known as GluR5, GluR6, GluR7, KA1 and KA2. Whereas glutamate itself can bind to all of these subunits leading to receptor activation, the aim is to design and chemically synthesise agents known as antagonists that can selectively block the activation of GluR6, GluR7 or KA1/KA2 subunits. We have generated computer models of the ligand binding cores of GluR6, GluR7 and KA1 based on our X-ray crystal structures of the ligand binding core of GluR5 in complex with selective GluR5 subunit antagonists. We plan to use these models to design molecules that interact selectively with subunit specific amino acid residues in the ligand binding core, thereby producing selective GluR6, GluR7 or KA1/KA2 antagonists. By observing what the effect of specific blockade of each of the kainate receptor subunits has on the functioning of the central nervous system, one can deduce the particular roles of that receptor subunit in the integrated pattern of central nervous activity. Kainate receptors are thought to play a role in the fundamental mechanisms by which part of the brain known as the hippocampus stores memories, though the role of each individual subunit in these processes is still controversial due to the lack of specific pharmacological tools. Subunit specific pharmacological tools developed in this project will enable us to understand the role of GluR6, GluR7 and KA1/KA2 in these mechanisms. In addition, we plan to produce radioisotope labelled subunit selective kainate receptor antagonists. This will enable us to visualise the location of the GluR6, GluR7 or KA1/KA2 subunits within particular brain regions such as the hippocampus.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Native kainate receptors in the mammalian central nervous system are tetramers comprised of different combinations of GluR5, GluR6, GluR7, KA1 and KA2 subunits. The lack of subunit selective kainate receptor antagonists is the principal impediment to the elucidation of the physiological roles of native kainate receptor subtypes in the central nervous system. We plan to adopt an integrated multidisciplinary approach involving synthetic organic chemistry, X-ray crystallography, computer-aided drug design, molecular biology and electrophysiology to efficiently identify novel pharmacological tools to characterize the physiological roles of individual kainate receptor subunits. In particular, we will develop potent and selective antagonists for GluR6, GluR7 and KA1/KA2 subunits based on leads we have already identified by compound library screening and those generated by computer-aided drug design using X-ray crystal structures and homology models, so that the role of these receptors in hippocampal synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity can be established. In addition, we plan to radiolabel the subunit selective kainate receptor antagonists. This will enable us to visualise the location of the GluR6, GluR7 or KA1/KA2 subunits in various brain regions such as the hippocampus.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>694029</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Eli Lilly &amp; Company Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Industrial collaboration with Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, USA</gtr:description><gtr:id>1CE01410-8A58-460A-BEC9-F9D7611B2C38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Resulted in a paper in the journal Neuropharmacology.

In this project we designed and synthesized chemicals (pharmacological tools) that block the action of glutamate at particular glutamate receptor subtypes that are activated by the natural product kainic acid (kainate receptors). Kainate receptors are tetramers made up of a combination of protein subunits known as GluK1-5. Whereas glutamate itself can bind to all of these subunits leading to receptor activation, we have developed chemical compounds known as antagonists, such as UBP310, ACET and UBP161, which selectively block the activation of GluK1. One antagonist, UBP310 has been radiolabelled so that it can be used to assay compounds on GluK1 and GluK3 subunits and to visualise the location of these subunits in the central nervous system. We have generated four new X-ray crystal structures of the ligand binding domain of GluK1 in complex with our antagonists. These new structures revealed a much wider variation in ligand-receptor interactions and ligand binding domain closure than found in our previous studies with the GluK1 antagonists UBP302 and UBP310. This underlines the necessity of obtaining X-ray crystal structures of the ligand binding domains of kainate receptors in complex with structurally unrelated antagonists to inform the drug design process. To provide more information for our ligand design work we mutated the DNA encoding for the GluK1-3 subunits, so that we could identify which of the amino acid residues are involved in determining antagonist selectivity. By utilizing data from the GluK1 crystal structures and the point mutation studies we were able to develop a new class of GluK1 selective antagonists and identify lead compounds for the development of selective antagonists for GluK2 and GluK3 subunits. By observing what the effect of specific blockade of each of the kainate receptor subunits has on the functioning of the central nervous system, one can deduce the particular roles of that receptor subunit in the integrated pattern of central nervous activity. Using antagonists developed in this project, we have shown that GluK1-containing kainate receptors play a role in the long lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission that is thought to be a fundamental mechanism by which a part of the brain known as the hippocampus stores memories.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Drug development in pharmaceutical companies.
