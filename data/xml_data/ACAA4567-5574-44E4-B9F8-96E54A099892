challenges in the life cycle of Oil&amp;amp;Gas offshore production installations (e.g. platforms and FPSOs) subsea assets including
pipelines and production pressure components. The project aims to develop novel guided wave ultrasonic technology for
subsea pipelines to be deployed by diver or a Remote Operating Vehicle (ROV): (A) Condition Monitoring (CM) for the
early detection of in-service defects, e.g. corrosion - using Long Range Guided Wave Ultrasonic (LR-GWU) Pulse Echo

400C.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIR0NMENTAL BENEFITS:
WITHIN THE CONSORTIUM. (A) ECONOMIC:The ROI as previously described. (B) SOCIAL: JOBS: Assuming 1 job per
&amp;pound;100kpa of turnover 107 jobs will be created within the consortium and further 71 jobs in their supply chain assuming 50%
added value. The participants will have a direct economic benefit that will be sustainable in the &amp;pound;30billion Oil&amp;amp;Gas offshore
market
OUTSIDE THE CONSORTIUM: (A) ECONOMIC:Asset Operators will gain through an increased availability and life
extension of their key production pipelines - 14,000kms) which has been estimated in Q1 (C) at &amp;pound;3mpa per HITCLEAN
installation. This means for the UK Asset operator an ROI of &amp;pound;3/&amp;pound;0.227m = 13:1pa (66:1 over 5 years) on their HITCLEAN
investment. For the estimated 15 installations in UK fields the total saving is &amp;pound;45mpa = &amp;pound;225m over 5 years. (B ) SOCIAL:
JOBS: The Oil&amp;amp;Gas business sector supports 450,000 people and contributes over &amp;pound;10bn to the Exchequer. ('UKCS
Maximising Recovery Review Report, Sir Ian Wood, 2014). The UK Oil&amp;amp;Gas sector is a mature market but it is still of key
strategic importance and with some North Sea assets continuing to produce after more than 40 years of service, proven
demonstrable asset integrity is of vital importance for economic (production availability), safety (HSE requirements) and
environmental (reduced hydrocarbon leaks) reasons. An extra 160 direct jobs in the offshore supply chain will be created
based on a 50% added value of the HITCLEAN sales. (C) ENVIRONMENTAL: (i) life cycle carbon emissions/unit of fossil
fuel energy produced for an offshore oil platform (construction, installation and decomissioning) reduced by a factor of 3%
as a result of
the product yield improvement of 3%. (ii) HITCLEAN will reduce the risk of hydrocarbon leakage through corrosion initiated
pipe failure and pressure loading initiated failure from fouling build up. Such small events are frequent, and castrophic
events occur every few years whichillions in terms of clean up, litigation/fines and compensation costs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>645464</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The initial findings have been used to disseminate the project scope and attract end-users for the project from the oil and gas as well as the power industry.

The project is still at an early stage, but it targets to:
- provide competitive ultrasonic power amplifier with excellent power, low noise and great durability
- provide novel guide waves ultrasonic anti-fouling unique solution for the energy and oil and gas industries. The same technology could be later applied to transport, marine and food industry among others.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4068486B-AAAD-405E-BC45-8F87FC854446</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Electronics,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Most fouling removal technologies rely on the use of chemicals. Although effective, such technologies have many drawbacks such as the frequent stoppage of the process to perform the removal. The main negative impact though is the hazard to the environment created by such chemical process.

To mitigate the negative impacts of chemical procedures, ultrasonic technology has been experimented for both fouling prevention and fouling removal. This technology relies on the cavitation; bubbles vibrate and explode in the water leading to the removal of the fouling films from the structure to which they are attached. The technology is efficient locally but the effect decreases dramatically as the distance to the transducer increases.

Inspired by the use of Ultrasonic Guided Waves for pipe inspection up to 100m whereas normal ultrasonic transducers work only locally, HitClean targets the generation of High Power Ultrasonic Guided Waves for fouling removal. Hence, instead of a local fouling prevention, a target of 12m could be reached. Not only, HitClean takes the anti-fouling range to different areas, it also targets high temperature (up to 60&amp;deg;C). Hence, it would provide a novel and efficient solution to the power and oil and gas industries for fouling prevention.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The technology - currently developed in the HitClean project - targets to provide a low cost high effieciency fouling prevention system by developing low cost power electronics and by optimising transducuer topology and number to perform fouling removal over 12m with a single collar of transducers.

Academically, the project targets to:
- improve the knowledge of fouling creation and prevention
- improve the modelling capabilities and achieve good corrolation between experiments and simulations for transducer ultrasonic vibrations, cavitation simulation, etc.
- investigate the sensitivty of ultrasonic wave propagation and piezoelectric behaviour under different temperatures</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D8E5BB50-2D80-494E-9289-3862456792FE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://hitcleanproject.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N012127/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6BF947B0-8E6E-48DB-AB68-7130938F2DF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrument. sensor &amp; detectors</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF8C9667-2697-4493-8519-7787831D008B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Accelerator R&amp;D</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F78E4567-DD59-4364-9D1F-0A778996E941</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrumentation Eng. &amp; Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>189E1F60-BF95-405D-A6F0-62BBD78E2DD5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Survey &amp; Monitoring</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
