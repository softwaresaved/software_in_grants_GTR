Though it is widely recognized that early modern European rulers made extensive use of mercenaries, with few exceptions this has not been placed within a much broader context of early modern privatized military activity. The governments of late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European states sanctioned military decentralization on a scale not achieved before or since, covering every aspect of military recruitment, command, control and organization, the production, purchase and transport of food, munitions and military equipment on both land and sea, and the creation of elaborate networks of finance, production and distribution which were international in scope and operations. The scale and comprehensiveness of this withdrawal of the state from military activity has not been appreciated, still less the relative effectiveness of privatized warfare, both in military and financial terms. A better understanding of this phenomenon is important and significant for the military and social history of the period: how and why did armies composed of profit-seeking shareholders achieve impressive military results; what were the social consequences of privatizing military force and its support systems? Most importantly, it offers an alternative model for the relationship between war and the changing nature of state power, challenging the typical link between some form of 'military revolution' in the scale and organization of warfare, and the growth of state centralization and bureaucracy. The book will also address the - hitherto apparently unproblematic - question of why, if enterprise was not in fact disastrously ineffective and it could deliver military results at sustainable cost, many aspects of this system should nonetheless have been curtailed by states in the second half of the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries? I will be exploring both the reasons for the decline of the system, but also emphasizing the extent to which many aspects of enterprise were not merely tolerated within later military systems, but consolidated and enhanced. I plan to support the argument throughout with integrated visual material - contemporary paintings and engravings, diagrams and maps - all of which will help clarify assertions about the nature of the system of military enterprise, and in particular my contentions about its relative effectiveness and sophistication. I hope that a scholarly approach, but a relatively accessible format and style, will help to disseminate the material of the book more widely, above all, given the burgeoning scholarly and public interest in the contemporary outsourcing of military functions to private contractors and companies. I have used an extensive range of printed primary sources while researching this project, but given its primary aim of offering a chronologically and geographically wide-ranging view of the subject, it will draw most heavily on extensive secondary works in German, English, French, Italian, Castilian and Dutch from the 18th to the 21st centuries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27068</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Outside of the academic environment, the impact of the work has proved slower to develop. The book has been well and widely reviewed in historical journals, but it may take time for it to enter into the frame of non-academic reference - contemporary debate and military policy-making. Meanwhile the public interest in military contracting, which reached a high point during the involvement in Iraq, has inevitably quietened with the military withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan and the changing character of current military engagements. However the issues raised by the debate over public-private military organization will not disappear, and I am confident that the contribution that my book - together with chapters and articles - makes as the only scholarly, in-depth exploration of the system of military contracting in a significant historical context will ensure that the findings will come to be used in a wider context. The type of future dissemination via more popular historical journals I proposed in the section on findings to be taken forward may assist this process.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>67596650-2E77-4313-953B-FC0C6A8F596A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has sought to integrate very disparate traditional understandings of the role of mercenaries and military contractors in early modern Europe into a much more coherent understanding of the scale and importance of the 'private sector' in organising and deploying military force. The central argument of the published book is that historians have previously treated as abnormal, and to some extent a dead-end, systems of military organisation based upon private initiatives, capital and resource deployment. Although 'mercenaries' as such have received some attention from military historians, the organizational structures, financing and support systems of warfare waged by private contractors have been largely ignored. Although my study (and much of the surrounding writing in articles and book chapters) focuses on military contractors in the early modern period (c. 1500 - c. 1750), the larger argument is that it is state-run, directly administered military organization which is the historical anomaly. In global historical terms, such &amp;quot;state militaries&amp;quot; can be identified with only a handful of past political systems, and often exist for relatively short periods of time. (In Europe I would argue for a window of less than 200 years, from the late 18th to the second third of the 20th century). This reversal of traditional historical assumptions about the relationship between warfare and the state is the key discovery/assertion in my work to date. Other discoveries, about the comparative effectiveness of private military organization in harnessing the limited resources of early modern European societies to sustain protracted warfare, challenges to technologically-determinist views of military history in this period, arguments about the centrality of the logistical-operational level of military activity, have all been the result of the larger research project and the funding received.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) While I have been working on this project, a number of other researchers and research groups with which I have been associated (especially in Sweden, the Netherlands and Spain) have been developing work on early modern contracting and entrepreneurship, and my research has both fed into this, and benefitted from their projects. Above all, my interest in military entrepreneurship can usefully and productively be compared and contrasted with studies of contracting in other areas of state activities - fiscality, communications, colonial expansion - as well as with other military systems outside of Europe. My involvement with these groups will continue, and will continue to generate useful cross-fertilization of ideas. 
2) The book provides, to date, the one serious, detailed and scholarly general account of the private organisation of early modern military force at a time when public as well as scholarly interest and debate about contemporary military outsourcing and reliance on private contractors is considerable. There is public awareness, and in some quarters unease, about the extent to which ancillary and support activities, but also some direct military functions, have been placed in the hands of contractors. I have not taken the opportunity so far formally to develop the links between my findings for early modern contracting and the contemporary debate - though I have explored the connection in a number of papers/presentations I have given at universities and local history groups. However in the future, some more explicit and published discussion of the links between early modern and contemporary contracting at a level of general interest (History Today, BBC History) would be appropriate.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4CECEB89-B130-47FF-9327-0D2A67B9F761</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E52CEEFA-804A-4D86-9B7C-F50C8A7FFECD"><gtr:id>E52CEEFA-804A-4D86-9B7C-F50C8A7FFECD</gtr:id><gtr:title>War, Entrepreneurs, and the State in Europe and the Mediterranean, 1300-1800</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/563654f6a25a0d0d8ddcd2c24f2a2486"><gtr:id>563654f6a25a0d0d8ddcd2c24f2a2486</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parrott D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>13:  9789004243644</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1AC3E5C2-808A-4159-A5C7-379C0682AB9E"><gtr:id>1AC3E5C2-808A-4159-A5C7-379C0682AB9E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Changing Character of War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/563654f6a25a0d0d8ddcd2c24f2a2486"><gtr:id>563654f6a25a0d0d8ddcd2c24f2a2486</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parrott D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-19-959673-7</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CC18E48A-5D98-413F-BDB9-9140A73DABBD"><gtr:id>CC18E48A-5D98-413F-BDB9-9140A73DABBD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Encyclopedia of War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4cc351ce5a9c3c544e48d5bd158b5c2f"><gtr:id>4cc351ce5a9c3c544e48d5bd158b5c2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>David  Parrott</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781444338232</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/68F8D3AD-1BC1-48F1-AAD8-9D0651613C02"><gtr:id>68F8D3AD-1BC1-48F1-AAD8-9D0651613C02</gtr:id><gtr:title>European Warfare, 1350-1750</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d3e33d082037316b1a65e9608187f0c2"><gtr:id>d3e33d082037316b1a65e9608187f0c2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>David Parrott</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780521713894</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1BA60E4E-A6D2-4DBC-9B93-52620BB17D76"><gtr:id>1BA60E4E-A6D2-4DBC-9B93-52620BB17D76</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxford Handbook of the Ancien Regime</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9fb4dd1b0d76657f9e277e76ea474ed8"><gtr:id>9fb4dd1b0d76657f9e277e76ea474ed8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>PARROTT, D.A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-19-929120-5</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E95963C2-24DF-4D3E-9927-7850487773E4"><gtr:id>E95963C2-24DF-4D3E-9927-7850487773E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;iquest;Revoluci&amp;oacute;n militar o devoluci&amp;oacute;n militar?
