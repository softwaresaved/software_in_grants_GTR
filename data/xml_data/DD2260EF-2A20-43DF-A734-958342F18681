Chemical compounds excreted from the human body are believed to reflect certain metabolic conditions as well as the blood gas content. The changes in concentration of some compounds, referred to as biomarkers, and chemical composition in human samples such as breath, blood, urine, sweat and saliva can be linked to particular diseases and have been intensively used in medicine for early and minimally invasive diagnosis. There is considerable interest in the development of sensor devices to identify compounds both in vivo and ex vivo that can facilitate non-invasive diagnosis. 

Sensing techniques based upon the use of optical fibre devices to probe the optical characteristics of nanomaterials that exhibit changes in their optical properties upon exposure to targeted chemical species are particularly attractive, in light of their potential high sensitivity, selectivity, the ready ability to multiplex arrays of sensors, and the prospect for remote sensing. Optical fibre grating devices, which are based upon a periodic perturbation of the refractive index of the core of the optical fibre, will be exploited as the sensing platform. Fibre gratings facilitate the controlled coupling of light between modes of the optical fibre structure at specific resonant wavelengths, with the wavelength showing sensitivity to perturbation of the fibre. Such devices have been applied extensively as sensors.

The techniques that will be exploited here further develop the methods pioneered at Cranfield that was awarded First Prize in the Frontier Science and Technology category of the 2004 National Measurement Awards, and further developed in a collaboration between Cranfield and Kitakyushu Universities, involving the deposition of nanoscale, functional coatings onto the surface of optical fibre devices. 

The project brings together a multidisciplinary team with expertise in photonics, chemistry, analytical science and health care delivery. This will exploit cutting edge sensing techniques and materials to facilitate the design, fabrication and characterisation of the sensors, with the aim of developing a diagnostic instrument for use by a non-specialist in a clinical setting. The output and impact of the research will be maximised through functional testing of the instrumentation in a clinical environment.

Thus this proposal will develop a point-of-care (POC) device that will be assessed for accuracy, sensitivity, reproducibility, reliability and ease of use in a clinical setting. This will be achieved by (i) taking a fibre optic ammonia sensor previously demonstrated by the Cranfield and Kitakyushu teams, optimising its sensitivity and improving its immunity to application- specific interference from temperature and humidity, (ii) benchmarking its performance against established technologies, (iii) developing it into a prototype point-of-care device for use by non-specialist clinical staff, (iv) demonstrating the generic nature of the sensor platform and instrument by using it to monitor other biomarkers (e.g. acetone) and (v) demonstrate a multiplexed sensor capable of monitoring simultaneously a number of analytes, in this case those identified in (iv).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>117661</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have published some work on colo rectal cancer markers relevant to the development of the fibre optic sensors. We have been working on the materials used in the prototype device, and have been developing standard and calibration mixtures.

We have carried out some work on potential materials to be used in the production of the sampling device for the sensor and determined the level of VOC emissions and absorption that occurs. This has resulted in a different design being used, and these results are being written up for publication.

We have continued to test VOCs from clinical samples to test appropriate VOCs to target in an optic fibre sensor.
We are considering how this may be extended to new applications (for example wound healing).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are continuing to develop methodology to test issues with breath and urine testing device.
We are looking at additional applications (skin, wound healing etc.).
