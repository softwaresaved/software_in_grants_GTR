system</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I027193/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>CONTEXT OF THE RESEARCH\nLinguistics is a discipline which faces a seemingly irresolvable competition between several theories of its central component, namely syntax (sentence structure). Further progress requires us to clarify how the concrete predictions of each theory differ. We will create a framework for comparing and evaluating the claims of leading theories of syntax (HPSG, LFG and Minimalism). We do this by focusing on one core area of syntax, namely agreement. Specifically, we shall use data from the Daghestanian language Archi, which has an outstandingly rich and complex agreement system, for analyses in each of the leading theories.\n\nWhen accounting for agreement, contemporary syntactic theories tend to concentrate on isolated instances of complexity found in different languages. To determine the compatibility of the solutions suggested for these separate problems, we need to scale up to a full account of a complete agreement system. Archi presents a rare case of a language whose agreement system challenges major claims found in three different syntactic theories. \n\nOur previous work on agreement gives us the theoretical apparatus necessary for describing an extreme agreement system in a consistent way. Our typological work makes us aware of the range of morphological and syntactic possibilities in agreement systems. Our earlier research on Archi, through fieldwork which led to the compiling of an innovative electronic dictionary, enables us to assess the frequencies of the different agreement strategies. This will allow us to investigate how the agreement system functions in Archi, and how its different components interact. The range of available materials, rather unique for an unwritten language with a small number of speakers, our expertise in fieldwork and the excellent working relations with the community make it possible to investigate the variation in agreement that the system allows.\n \nThe project will employ an innovative model of investigation and dissemination. It is structured around regular day-long seminars, at which a key part of the agreement system of Archi will be analysed according to the three theories, the differences will be discussed by representatives of these theories, and further fieldwork requirements will be specified. Dissemination will begin as early as the third month of the project, through a Wiki. This will give the essential Archi data, and refer to the annotated corpus of Archi, published online in parallel to the Wiki. The Wiki will have three strands of responses, contributing to the three analyses of the data, in HPSG, LFG and Minimalism. These condensed materials will be of value for those interested in any one of the major theories of syntax, for those wishing to compare and contrast the three theories, and for those wanting to approach a language with extremely demanding syntax. \n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n1. Provide an implemented framework for comparing and evaluating syntactic theories. \n2. Produce an ontologically consistent description of the agreement system in Archi.\n3. Give three parallel syntactic accounts of the body of challenging data.\n4. Investigate the full range of function and variability of the Archi agreement system.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS\nThe obvious benefit is for theory: never before have syntactic theories been compared and contrasted in such a controlled, rigorous and innovative way. In terms of our understanding of extreme agreement systems, the benefits will also be considerable, since we shall have three complementary views, together with investigation of frequency data and research into the functioning of the system, which often lie outside syntacticians' main interests. The methodological innovations should also provide a model for collaborative research on problems which are challenging both inherently and because of the the theoritical diversity of the field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This theoretical research has its major impact within syntactic and morphological theory. However, there are key areas where this research has a potential impact on four other constituencies. Our impact plan is geared towards the two non-academic communities of the four listed below, and we have marked these with an asterisk: \n\nSpeech community*\nGiven the nature of the current school situation, and the continuous media pressure, Archi is a seriously endangered language. Survival depends both on the esteem in which the language is held by its speakers and the regard of neighbouring communities where larger languages are spoken. Our work on the Archi Dictionary has had a positive impact. Continuing academic involvement in the language by outsiders, this time concentrating on syntax, is welcomed and highly valued by the Archi community.\n\nSpecialists in language technologies\nArchi is a truly amazing language in terms of its use of agreement as a syntactic mechanism within an ergative system. Understanding this complex system has potential longer-term benefits for the development of sophisticated NLP applications. Current applications are almost exclusively dedicated to English and other similar languages. Very little has been done on applications for the majority of the world's languages, which do not share the typological pecularities of standard average European. We are currently investigating this area of impact, and have already scheduled a seminar on Morphological Complexity and Computational Linguistics at the Sorbonne in 2013 (local organiser Olivier Bonami).\n\nSpecialists in on-line ontologies\nThe formal implemented description which will be a product of the research will inform the development of the GOLD ontology for linguistic description, available to the wider community via the Linguist List site. This will continue and develop the impact of our research on Archi through the Linguist List's LEGO project (Lexicon Enhancement via the GOLD Ontology), funded by the National Science Foundation (http://linguistlist.org/projects/lego.cfm). \n\nFoundation for Endangered Languages*\nThis campaigning organisation attracts attention from the wider public, well beyond academic linguists. We shall ensure that this body is fully informed of the progress of the work on Archi. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>501499</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>During the lifetime of the project we had the opportunity to work with texts recorded in the Archi village between 2005 and 2010. We trained one of our Archi translators, Zumzum Magomedova, to transcribe Archi texts using Microsoft word and the Cyrillic orthography (worked out by a team of linguists from SMG and Moscow State University). 
Zumzum also translated the texts into Russian. To make these texts widely available we transliterated them into Latin-based orthography, translated them into English and provided them with interlinear glossing. The texts were then made available online as sound files and pdf text files. 
The texts have been recorded from people of age range from 25 to 100 and include different genres such as memories of childhood, jokes, folk stories, local legends and an Archi traditional mourning song.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8BC8F942-3C44-4D4A-BD38-4B94C397C822</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Archi recordings with English translations and morphological analysis have been published online only recently.

During the course of the project Dunstan Brown received an invitation for a guest professorship from the Universit&amp;eacute; Paris Diderot (Paris 7) for October 2015. One activity for this professorship was a lecture series entitled 'Morphological complexity: defining it and measuring it'. This was an open lecture series open to all who were interested. The work on Archi, particularly understanding the complexities of Archi identified by Chumakina &amp;amp; Corbett (2015), was discussed as part of the series, focusing on how it can be modelled, thereby allowing us to demonstrate to a wider public the special interest of Archi. In 2012 Marina Chumakina gave two public lectures in Tomsk, Russian Federation, about linguistic fieldwork methods using Archi as case study. From the perspective of impact this is particularly important, as Dagestan is technically part of the Russian Federation, yet it is poorly understood within other regions of that country. Given the current political situation there, the talks helped to promote greater understanding at a time when there is a desperate need for it. 
 
Archi Ontology and the General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD)

It is important that proposals for standardizing and generalizing linguistic features for practical applications are informed by in-depth research into the linguistic issues involved (Corbett 2012: 265-268). A big issue is that of data comparability. That is, where we have, for example, a particular case value in one language to what extent can we be sure that it corresponds to the same value in another language? This is important for natural language processing, particularly where the systems involved are to be used across multiple languages. The General Ontology for Linguistic Description is an ontology that gives information on linguistic terminology. One result of the Archi project is that we have developed fragments of descriptions of some of the more interesting parts of Archi agreement with some aspects of the typology, the Minimalist and the HPSG description implemented. Links between these different descriptions, including features, allow us to see how the theories differ in their treatments. This forms the basis of a longer term resource that we will develop to enable others to see how features work in a wider theoretical context and will be useful for proposals related to standardizing and generalizing linguistic features, as it will form a basis for future understanding of the core and peripheral distinctions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D01410DF-D6DB-4C59-B5DB-846004D711A2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The finding are discussed in their relation to the project objectives. 

The first objective was to create a framework for comparing and evaluating syntactic theories (Minimalism, HPSG and LFG). To do this we took a challenging language, the Dagestanian language Archi, and within it we focussed on its complex agreement system. A particularly interesting part of the system is the biabsolutive construction, which proved a good testing ground to compare different approaches to syntax. Three syntactic accounts of this construction were presented at the special session of the Linguistic Society of America Meeting (Minneapolis, 2014). This allowed us to contrast and compare the approaches. The most important finding arising from the comparison was the identification of four salient properties which every theoretical approach to syntax must have. The properties have been obtained by abstracting over the generalisations in the data as well as the proposals for specific analyses within each of the frameworks. 

The comparison at this level of abstraction allowed us answer the question of whether the given syntactic approach considers the mechanisms involved in agreement and those regulating the linear order as interconnected. It could be argued that while the Minimalist analysis maintains a tighter relationship between the constituency and the linear order, both the HPSG and LFG analyses view the agreement as a separate mechanism.

These findings are discussed in detail in chapter 8 of a book in press in the series Oxford Studies of Endangered Languages (Oxford University Press). The book has been submitted to the publisher and is to appear in the summer of 2016. 

The second objective was to provide a full description of the agreement system in an endangered language. The Archi agreement has never been an object of a focussed description before and therefore there were significant lacunae. During the course of this project we had an opportunity to fill these in a systematic way: the field work was guided by the theoretical questions formulated at the project seminars. We have identified four areas where we elaborate on the existing description of Archi or describe the phenomena for the first time: 
(1) Semantic agreement. This is found in agreement with conjoined phrases: the verb can agree either in the plural, with both elements, or in the singular, with just one of them. We explain the possibilities in Chumakina (2013), and establish factors influencing the choice of plural vs. singular agreement. 

(2) The biabsolutive construction. This important construction was mentioned above. As a result of extensive fieldwork on this construction we have described the agreement behaviour of the non-verbal elements (adverbs, dative pronouns and particles). We have also established that Archi allows the biabsolutive construction not only for the transitive verbs but also for verbs of perception which normally take dative-absolutive alignment. Until now, no firm data of this kind was obtained for any other Dagestanian language. The findings were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America in 2014 and will be published in Chapter 4 of the book in press with Oxford University Press. 

(3) The agreeing postposition eq'en. Postpositions are akin to the prepositions we find in English, such as on or behind, but they occur after the noun, rather than before it. Of all non-verbal agreement targets in Archi the postposition eq'en is particularly interesting. It agrees either with the subject in an intransitive clause, or with the object in a transitive clause rather than with its noun complement. This is a rare type of agreement. We have studied this postposition in depth, established its derivational source and described its agreement behaviour in (Chumakina &amp;amp; Brown: Charting adposition agreement: paper submitted to Linguistic Typology). In the course of this work, we have also described a previously unknown verbal form - a small class of irregular converbs in -en. This is important not only for the description of Archi but also for the studies of variation within the family: as far as we know, agreeing postpositions in other Nakh-Dagestanian languages originate from stative verbs or locative forms of the copula. 

(4) Attributives. There is a lexical class in Archi which consists almost exclusively of derived forms - the class of attributives. Its particular interest lies in the fact that the derivational sources for the attributives vary hugely from bound stem to fully inflected forms, yet the external syntax of the attributives and their agreement behaviour is surprisingly homogenous. We have provided a full description of the agreement behaviour of this unusual class. (Bond &amp;amp; Chumakina: Attributives in Archi: a mixed category with multiple bases: paper submitted to Linguistics) 

Our third objective: providing three parallel syntactic accounts of a challenging data - have been also achieved. These can be seen on the WIKI page (see the link on http://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/projects/competing-theories/wiki). That shows the parallel accounts in development; the fuller and more considered versions are in the volume: Oliver Bond, Greville G. Corbett, Marina Chumakina &amp;amp; Dunstan Brown (editors).

We created a framework for comparing and evaluating the claims of leading theories of syntax (HPSG, LFG and Minimalism), by focusing on one core area of syntax, namely agreement. Specifically, we used data from the Daghestanian language Archi, which has an outstandingly rich and complex agreement system, for analyses in each of the leading theories.The project was structured around regular day-long seminars, at which a key part of the agreement system of Archi will be analysed according to the three theories, the differences will be discussed by representatives of these theories, and further fieldwork requirements will be specified. Dissemination was through a Wiki This gave the essential Archi data, and referred to the annotated corpus of Archi, published online in parallel to the Wiki. The Wiki had three strands of responses, contributing to the three analyses of the data, in HPSG, LFG and Minimalism. These condensed materials are of value for those interested in any one of the major theories of syntax, for those wishing to compare and contrast the three theories, and for those wanting to approach a language with extremely demanding syntax.
