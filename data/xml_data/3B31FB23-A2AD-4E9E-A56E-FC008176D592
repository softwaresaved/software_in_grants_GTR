Whilst we cannot measure the subjective states of other animals directly, it is important that we develop accurate indirect measures. It is also important that these measures can be used in both lab and field, especially on farms. This is because assessment of welfare is becoming a significant part of on-farm quality assurance schemes which aim to provide reliable information for the consumer about how food is produced. These schemes tend to assess welfare by measuring the resources available to animals (e.g. trough space) - a very indirect measure - or physical damage to the animal which may only reveal relatively severe problems. We aim to develop a new measure of welfare that more closely reflects the emotional states which lie at the heart of animal welfare concerns. This measure will also be of value in lab studies, precluding the need to isolate animals for testing. When animals are disturbed by an alerting stimulus that may signal danger (e.g. loud noise), they show a suite of defensive responses including startle and orientation, freezing and evaluation of the situation, and a final response of fleeing or resuming ongoing behaviour. Theoretical predictions, and studies of humans and rodents, suggest that the components of this 'defence cascade' (DC) are modulated by the individual's emotional state. For example, individuals in a negative state are predicted to show a stronger and faster initial startle response, to be more likely to show a final fleeing response, to make this decision faster, and to be slower to make a final decision to stay put, than individuals in a positive state. We will test these predictions in an important farmed species, the domestic pig. The pig shows a clear DC response to sudden noises (e.g. door slam), and we will develop standardised methods for inducing this response. Parts of the DC have been studied in humans and rodents under 'gold standard' laboratory conditions using force plate technology. It would be impractical to use such equipment on farms, but video images of the defence cascade could easily be collected and analysed to quantify the response. To develop these video-based methods, we will study individual pigs' DC responses under controlled conditions where we can obtain video and force plate data simultaneously. We will use computational image analysis to derive numerical output from the video footage and correlate this with the conventional 'gold standard' measures to determine whether image analysis accurately measures the DC response. We will also develop novel image analysis measures of group DC responses (pigs are usually group housed) - e.g. how rapidly a response spreads across a group - and investigate whether manipulation of welfare / emotional state (e.g. by housing groups in different conditions) affects DC responses as predicted above. We will then trial the image analysis measures of DC responses that best reflect emotional state / welfare on farms. Because the image analysis approach we use does not need to identify individual animals, we anticipate that it will cope with the visual challenges of a 'real-life' farm environment. We will accompany farm assurance assessors to farms, measure DC responses, collect data on the conditions on farms and in pens, and evaluate the relationships between these different measures using statistical techniques. This will show us how our DC measures reflect independent assessments of welfare at farm and pen level. We thus hope to produce a validated, non-invasive, quick and practical method for measuring animal welfare that can be adapted to other species, can be used in the field as well as the lab (including as part of farm assurance audits), and gets closer to reflecting the important emotional component of welfare than any existing field-based measure.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project will develop a new method for assessing animal welfare in the lab and field. Good field-based measures are needed because welfare criteria are important components of on-farm quality assurance schemes. However, most field-based measures provide limited information on the affective states of animals which are central to people's concerns about welfare. The defensive responses shown to an alerting stimulus (e.g. startle / orientation, freezing / evaluation, fleeing or resuming ongoing behaviour) may reflect underlying affective states. Theory, and studies of humans and rodents, suggest that this 'defence cascade' (DC) is modulated by affect. Individuals in a negative state are predicted to: show a stronger and faster initial startle response; be more likely to show a final fleeing response; make this decision faster; be slower to make a final decision to stay put, than individuals in a positive state. We will test these predictions in an important farmed species, the pig, which shows a clear DC response. We will first develop a method for measuring DC responses that uses computational image analysis (IA) of videos of the behaviour. Readouts from computational IA will be correlated with simultaneously collected 'gold standard' measures of DC responses (force plate, behavioural observation) in singly tested pigs to identify the best correlated measures. These IA measures will then be used to quantify DC responses of individual pigs in groups (group housing is the norm on farms) and to develop novel emergent measures of group response. The effects of manipulations of affect / welfare on IA measures will be used to test the predictions listed above. IA measures that best reflect affective modulation of DC responses will then be trialled on farms. The relationship between DC responses, independent assessments of welfare, and other 'background' variables will be determined using multi-level modelling.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will deliver tools and techniques for generating and monitoring defence cascade responses as validated indicators of animal affect and welfare under 'real-life' farm, and laboratory, conditions. It will have a number of benefits outside the academic sector. In the livestock industry, farm quality assurance schemes are increasingly keen to incorporate welfare measures based on the animal (rather than the resources provided) into their assessments. Our approach offers just such a measure, designed to reflect the animal's affective state - the core of people's concerns about welfare. Because of the image analysis procedures used, the approach should be readily generalisable beyond pigs (our study species) and hence applicable to a wide range of on-farm quality assurance schemes. It will benefit these schemes, the livestock industry, and the general public, by enhancing the scientific validity of on-farm welfare assessment, providing more accurate information for the public and decision makers, and contributing to improved quality of life for farm animals, and resulting product quality. We have agreement for collaboration within this project from the British Pig Executive (BPEX), the main pig industry levy board which is directly involved in livestock assurance schemes, allowing us to communicate findings directly to our industry contacts, as well as more generally through articles in the pig industry press. Our approach may also offer a new home-cage, group-based method for affect assessment in lab animals that alleviates the need for the stressful handling and isolation of animals that are tested in conventional Skinner box 'startle tests'. Any potential for further development and 'roll out' of this approach will be explored through our links with pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Pfizer, MSD). As well as providing a stronger scientific basis underpinning the quality assurance criteria upon which some members of the public base their food-purchasing decisions, the research will raise general public interest issues to do with 'animal mind' and 'animal emotion'. We will communicate relevant findings through press releases, articles in popular science magazines, public talks and exhibits (e.g. National Science and Engineering Week). We will engage with government and related NGO and charity bodies (e.g. Defra, HO, EU, NC3Rs, RSPCA), particularly those organizations involved in developing / policing legislation concerning farm animal welfare, through reports, meetings, expert advice on working groups, presentations to relevant bodies, and via contacts already formed through our work for, and advice to, these bodies. The methods developed in this research could be implemented by an integrated DC induction stimulus generator and image analysis software and / or hardware package. If the development of such a package appears feasible, we will liaise with the Bristol University Research and Enterprise Development Dept for advice on IP and commercialisation issues as necessary, and make an application for BBSRC 'follow-on funding'. The timescale of potential commercial benefits from our research is difficult to estimate until the project is in progress and the results become evident. Staff employed on this project already have considerable experience in communicating the impact of their work through interactions with the media, positions on advisory bodies and strategy / review groups, direct contact with the public at scientific exhibitions; personal contacts in governmental, NGO and industry groupings. Further training will be sought (e.g. BBSRC Media Training Course) to expand this skill set.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>588271</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Development and widening of collaboration with Bristol computer vision researchers</gtr:description><gtr:id>43E0411D-D8B1-46A1-B797-DFC068AB5A90</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint student projects are now ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our current computer science collaborators (Campbell, Hannuna) are focusing on movement detection, whilst a new team member (Burghardt) is investigating individual recognition possibilities.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have broadened our collaboration with Bristol computer vision researchers to start work involving parallel undergraduate student projects on individual recognition and behaviour detection in domestic cattle.

Oliver has run complex analyses and expects to deliver the finalised dataset of computer vision readouts within the next couple of weeks - much has been learnt about effective ways of analysing this particular dataset. Once these data are received from the computer science team, we will incorporate them into multilevel modelling analyses of treatment effects on conventionally recorded behaviour data. The delay has been extremely frustrating and has meant that published outputs have also been delayed because our plan to produce a paper detailing a 'from lab to field' story of method development in a high impact journal (see below) requires the full dataset to be available. We are still following this strategy. Its success will of course depend on how the final analysis pans out.

MARCH 2016: Because this multidisciplinary project is unusual in spanning from pure science to application, a strategic decision was made to withhold publication of data until the project was completed, and then to submit a substantial paper to a journal such as Nature Methods, summarising the progress from basic underpinning science in the lab to application on farm. This is still our plan (there have been delays due to a 9-month maternity leave by one RA and not the other, meaning that when the first RA returned to work, the second RA was only available for 50% of their time, hence slowing down the final computer vision analysis - see later for more details). In the meantime, we have presented the work at many behaviour / welfare and computer vision conferences, winning the best poster prize at the 2015 International Conference on Pig Welfare in Copenhagen. Overall, the project has been successful in achieving all objectives and developing a new and standardized way of measuring DC responses in the pig which can be used under field conditions. WE HERE PROVIDE A BRIEF 3-POINT SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS, FOLLOWED BY A LONGER REPORT:

(1) In the lab, we demonstrated that computer vision methods can be used to measure the defence cascade (DC: startle and freeze) responses of individual pigs to a sudden sound, showing strong correlation with human observer, force plate and motion capture metrics. The first in a series of sound stimuli showed the best correlations. The finding opens the way for using computer vision to assess DC responses in pigs on farms as an indicator of affective state and welfare (in humans and rodents the magnitude of startle responses is known to be a good indicator of an individual's affective state).

(2) In the lab, we upscaled the work on individual pigs to groups and used both environmental and pharmacological manipulations of affective state to see whether the manipulated states led to changes in DC responses. Correlations and multi-level modelling showed that diazepam treated pigs showed shorter group freeze durations that reboxetine treated pigs indicating that animals in a calmer state did indeed differ in their DC response. There were no observed differences in startle magnitude. Surprisingly, pigs in enriched environments showed a stronger group startle response than those in barren housing, though they also showed higher levels of salivary cortisol indicating a higher general state of arousal.

(3) We translated the method on to working farms and used our computer vision method to assess DC responses in groups of pigs kept under different conditions. We found that a stronger DC response was observed in pigs that were dirty, kept on slatted as opposed to solid flooring, had access to few manipulable objects, and were more avoidant of people. However, pigs with leg problems showed a less strong DC response, perhaps because of limitations to mobility. The DC response shows promise as a potential new and practical on-farm welfare indicator that can be quickly tested and measured from standard video recordings using computer vision methods.


A FULL REPORT ON KEY FINDINGS IS PROVIDED BELOW


This project brings together researchers in animal behaviour and welfare, computer vision, biomechanics, biostatistics and psychopharmacology to study the defence cascade (DC) response (startle, freeze, vigilance) which is shown by many mammalian species in response to sudden loud noises. The startle component of this response is reliably potentiated in humans and rodents experiencing negative affective states, and ameliorated in those experiencing positive states. The ultimate aim of the project is to develop a prototype practical approach to measuring this response in a commercially important farmed species, the domestic pig, which can be used as a new indicator of animal affect and welfare under field (farm) conditions. This would be an important contribution to the current increasing interest in and use of 'on-farm welfare' assessment and auditing which generally lacks animal-based measurements that really address the key aspect of an animal's welfare - its affective state. Instead there is a lot of reliance on measuring what resources are available to the animals (e.g. trough space, straw etc.) rather than exactly how these impact on the animal's welfare. The challenges of this project are to develop a method that can be used in the field - e.g. startle responses are usually measured using force plates (rodents) or electromyography (humans) - with a focus on (ultimately automated) computer vision analysis of video recordings; to investigate how DC responses vary according to manipulations of affective state in the pig; to test the approach under field conditions. We have addressed these challenges and have the following key findings:


Objective (i): to develop new methods for measuring the DC response in single pigs in the lab: In this part of the study we used a custom-built force plate to measure the DC response of pigs to a variety of standardised sudden loud noises. We also used motion-capture techniques (attaching markers to individual pigs), direct ethological observations, and computer vision analyses of videos (fast-capture: 50fps) of the responses. The aim was to see whether computer vision methods reliably correlate to the 'gold standards' of force plate, mo-cap, and ethological observation. 286 DC tests were carried out in total on 12 pigs from 9-19 weeks of age. Following initial analysis of videos, sparse feature tracking was selected as the most suitable method for computer vision analysis. Using sparse features is advantageous as only the easiest regions to track are considered which improves accuracy compared to dense feature tracking. Birchfield's implementation of the Kanade Lucas Tomasi (KLT) tracker was utilised. Accelerations of highly textured image regions were estimated using sparse feature tracking as indicators of the magnitude of the startle response (mean acceleration for the x KLT points displaying the largest accelerations). Data were extracted for a range of x values (from 10 to 150) in order to compare the measures - they were all highly correlated. Startle magnitude was defined as the maximum acceleration in a temporal window 0.7 seconds after the startle stimulus. For freeze, both speed and acceleration were extracted. Freeze duration for video footage and force plate data were defined as the total time that the speed of the y fastest KLT points and force plate readings respectively were below an empirically determined threshold for a continuous period of at least 0.4 seconds.

Correlations and multi-level statistical models controlling for the hierarchical nature of the data (e.g. tests nested within pig) were used to investigate the relationship between different measures. All measures, including computer vision, were strongly positively correlated for both startle and freeze metrics. Multi-level models indicated that repeated testing influenced startle responses suggesting habituation to the startle stimulus across time and/or decreasing responsiveness in older animals. We also found that a simple subjective rating of the pigs' affective state (from calm to highly-aroused) when they entered the force plate test area predicted the magnitude of startle and the duration of freeze responses. Calmer pigs showed smaller startle magnitudes and shorter freezes (although highly aroused pigs did not show this relationship as they were attempting to escape from the test arena). This result is in line with the findings of human and rodent studies. For the freeze response, all automated measures had very high sensitivity, i.e. they rarely missed a freeze when the human observer scored one. However, they all showed some lack of specificity, by generating false positives (detecting a freeze when the human observer did not categorise one). This was likely because pigs can be still for a variety of reasons (e.g. resting, sleeping, freezing) and it was difficult for our automated measures to discriminate these. Overall, the findings indicated that the KLT computer vision analysis of videos was a reliable indicator of startle magnitude and freeze, and that the results of the first test in a sequence are likely to be most reliable as pigs tend to be alert (not resting) and have not habituated to the stimulus.


Objectives (ii) and (iii): to upscale DC measures from single subjects to groups, and to test the relationship between DC responses and manipulations of affective state / welfare: On farms, pigs are usually housed in groups so a group-level DC measure is required. In this study we measured DC responses in 12 groups of 4 pigs in their home pens rather than individually on a force plate, thus more closely simulating the conditions under which the measures would be taken on farm. We used the KLT sparse feature tracking computer vision methods developed in objective (i) and validated using the force plate, and we also carried out ethological recordings. We designed a standardised metal clapper board device to generate a rapid onset loud sound as the board hit a metal bar (mean: 102dB at 1m). To manipulate affective state / welfare, pigs were either housed with multiple enrichment objects which, on the basis of previous studies, are thought to generate better welfare, or in barren conditions. Pigs from both housing groups were also exposed to pharmacological manipulations of affective state that we piloted on a different set of animals. From previous work, including in other species, we predicted that azaperone (a commonly used neuroleptic in pigs: 'stresnil') and diazepam (DZP) would have anxiolytic effects and induce a relatively positive affective state, whilst pentylenetetrazole and a single dose of reboxetine (REBOX) would have anxiogenic effects inducing a negative state. In a study using two doses of each drug we found that DZP and REBOX most reliably showed the predicted effects. Additionally, providing these as oral doses removed the need for restraint and drug injection which itself had marked effects on the pigs' behaviour and state.

Correlations and multi-level models once more showed a strong positive relationship between observer 'gold standard' measures of DC responses and the computer vision methods. We analysed data at group level (N=288 events) using the KLT method, and also at individual pig level (N=1152 events) by developing a program which identifies pig head and tail regions from an overhead video and tracks individual movements on this basis. The correlations between observer analysis and computer vision measures of group DC responses were better than those based on the individual pig data. We also confirmed that the lower specificity of computer vision measures of the freeze response is alleviated when the first response in a session is analysed in comparison to when all responses across a session are analysed, probably because pigs are more likely to be active at the start of a test sequence due to new human presence, hence minimising the likelihood of false positive freeze detections. Overall, these findings corroborate those from objective (i) that computer vision can be reliably used to measure startle and freeze components of the DC response, and they also indicate that this can be done at group level. 

Multi-level models investigated the effects of experimental treatments and other factors on DC responses. Surprisingly, pigs in enriched housing showed higher levels of group startle magnitudes than those in barren environments. This ran counter to our predictions, but it was noticeable that levels of salivary cortisol both prior to and following DC tests, and aggression in the home pen, were higher in pigs from the enriched environment. It is possible that our enrichment manipulation, involving more frequent and unpredictable interaction with humans supplying food, enrichments etc., inadvertently generated more stressed or aroused pigs. REBOX treatment resulted in prolonged group freeze responses relative to control and DZP treatments, in line with predictions, but drug manipulations did not lead to significant differences in measures of group startle magnitude. These findings all remained significant when entering the effects of other variables into models, including the findings that freeze magnitudes decreased in response to repeated DC stimuli in a test sequence, and with the percentage of pigs standing, and that startle magnitudes increased in lighter groups of pigs and with the percentage of pigs standing. Overall, the findings support our hypothesis that freeze duration increases in pigs in a putatively more negative state, but evidence is not clear for the hypothesis that startle magnitude also increases. They also indicate that standardising initial activity of pigs (e.g. getting them to stand) is likely to remove a potential confound and also minimise false positive freeze data, and that pig weight should be taken into account when using the test.


Objective (iv): to translate the new methods to the 'real-life' field situation. Having developed a method for measuring DC responses that can be used under field conditions, the final phase of the study involved going on to farms to investigate how DC responses were related to independent measures of pig welfare on these farms. At this point, the RA in charge of the behavioural side of the project (bRA) took 9 month's maternity leave and this substantially affected the study. During the maternity leave period, the RA in charge of the computer vision part of the project (cRA) was able to move to 50% time due to the serendipitous availability of another 50% contract, and we were able to employ temporary technicians to collect some of the on-farm data. However, when bRA returned, cRA was consequently only able to devote 50% of his time to the project and this significantly delayed computer vision analysis of the last phase of the study. On returning to work, the bRA decreased her working hours to 60%FTE due to new child care commitments, thus extending the endpoint of her employment by a further 3 mo. Accordingly, BBSRC agreed a 12-month no-cost extension. Despite these issues, 21 farm visits were made and 423 DC tests carried out on 141 groups of pigs ranging from young weaners (N=39 groups) to grower/finishers (N=88 groups) to adult sows (N=14 groups), using the portable DC stimulus designed for objectives (ii) and (iii). On each farm, detailed 'conventional' measures of welfare were made for each group, including measures of resource availability and pig condition as used in the EU Welfare Quality&amp;reg; assessment protocol for pigs. Farm conditions provided new challenges to the computer vision analysis including poor lighting conditions, low ceilings necessitating use of fish-eye lenses, and different sized pens and camera angles. Extracted pixel trajectories thus needed to be transformed to a 'rectilinear projection' to recover straight lines and normalise the distances represented from the centre to the edge of the video frame. Perspective projection from camera angles not parallel to the ground plane also needed to be corrected to ensure that the motion of pigs was not over or under estimated depending on their position in the frame. Similar corrections were necessary to ensure that movements measured by the system were invariant to camera height. These were all achieved with significant work by cRA. Multi-level models were then used to relate computer vision DC measures to independent measures of welfare. These are currently being completed due to the issues mentioned above. Analysis of the 1st test in each sequence indicates that, controlling for pig age (older pigs show a lower startle magnitude), startle magnitude was higher in pigs that were housed on slatted as opposed to solid flooring, had access to fewer manipulable objects, were dirtier, and were more avoidant of people in a standardised test. Pigs with more leg problems (bursae, lameness) had lower startle magnitudes perhaps because a lack of mobility may interfere with startle responses. Overall, startle magnitude shows promise as a potential new on-farm welfare indicator.


Following the successful first objective of the task, and because this multidisciplinary project is unusual in spanning from pure science to application, a strategic decision was made to withhold publication of data until the project was completed, and then to submit a substantial paper to Nature Methods, summarising the progress from basic underpinning science in the lab to application on farm. This is still our plan. In the meantime, we have presented the work at many behaviour / welfare and computer vision conferences, winning the best poster prize at the 2015 International Conference on Pig Welfare in Copenhagen. Overall, the project has been successful in achieving all objectives and developing a new and standardized way of measuring DC responses in the pig which can be used under field conditions. Likely next steps will include further validation under field conditions, and automation of the computer vision methods to allow the test to be more made more widely available. We have received interest in using the approach for on-farm welfare assessment from researchers in the Netherlands, France and Denmark.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have a prototype method for using computer vision methods to measure defence cascade responses (startle, freeze) in pigs under real-life farming conditions as a measure of affective state and welfare.
