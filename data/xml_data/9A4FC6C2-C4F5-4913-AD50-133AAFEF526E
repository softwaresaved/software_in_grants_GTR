They have knowledge that those outside the conflict do not possess. The dominant peace and conflict intervention strategies of international agencies and NGOs begin with assessing the conflict situation using models based on western understanding of conflict trajectories, community resilience and peacebuilding, with an outsiders understanding. Although local people may be involved, their knowledge is rarely informing intervention and support strategies. This research will show the importance of placing local, contested, knowledge in the centre of intervention strategies, empowering and enabling local people and potentially making interventions more effective.
The research takes a case study of local conflict knowledge in Karen and Mon areas of Myanmar, training local researchers to use storytelling, arts and craft approaches to enable local people to represent and share their knowledge in culturally appropriate ways, through which they share their understanding of the conflicts, violence and peace strategies. The content of what they produce will be mapped onto the existing conflict analysis of the local partner in order to analyse the themes and gaps.
The local partner is Nonviolent Peaceforce, an NGO who provide unarmed civilian peacekeeping and protection of civilians to local communities around the world. They have been in Myanmar since 2012 and the results of this research will enable them to be more able to capture and use local knowledge about the conflicts, violence and peace to inform future project choices.
This international and innovative research will impact on local people by making their voices louder and clearer, on Nonviolent Peaceforce interventions by potentially making them more effective, and on academic and policy approaches to conflict analysis, 'the local', and the types of knowledge used in understanding conflict and peace. It crosses peace and conflict studies and arts disciplines, adding methodologically and to the way we teach about conflict knowledge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The structure and nature of this research has been developed with an understanding that local people will directly benefit from the participation in, and results from the research, as well as the local partner, other international NGOs, academics, and practitioners in the developments and challenge to current conflict analysis, and overall on future effectiveness of interventions.

In Myanmar, the two local researchers will be trained in participatory methods and data collection, which will directly benefit them, and also be building capacity for future research. Local participants will benefit because by collecting their knowledge in culturally appropriate ways we will influence the provision of suitable interventions, and a recognition of the value of local knowledge. Through the printed report we will disseminate their voices to other local and national actors.

The local partner, Nonviolent Peaceforce, will benefit from the local knowledge of the workshop participants which will add to their understanding of the complexity of the situation and have additional insights into locally generated peace approaches. The findings from the workshop will be mapped onto their current analysis so it will be clear where there are opportunities for further investigation.

There will be an impact on other peace and conflict intervention and support agencies. Whist we won't be mapping directly onto their analysis, the dissemination of the results will include talks, teaching and written materials that will enable them to be more able to gather, value and use local knowledge in their planning.

Outside Myanmar, our research will contribute to a changing understanding of the value and role of local knowledge in conflict analysis. This will have an impact on programme staff in UN agencies and International NGOs by making their projects more relevant to local people and more effective by valuing local capacity. It will have an impact on policy staff who devise and update conflict analysis systems and approaches, and on the teaching of conflict analysis.

The final booklet and online exhibition of the art works created (and have the consent from participants to use) will be available for future research and as teaching materials, or resource on cultural understand of conflict.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80291</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research on Aberystwyth website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58AC56A6-CB1E-47F8-A383-43017F1FB750</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Aberystwyth University promoted the research through its media work.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/interpol/research/researchprojects/currentresearchprojects/raisingsilentvoicesharnessinglocalknowledgeforcommunitiesprotectionfromviolenceinmyanmar/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Open day presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D412903F-2869-4116-A7B0-FAEDFDC23535</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research was highlighted in an Open Day talk for new students in the University.

We have trained a local community activist in our research and she is gaining new skills and networks.

We have fed back initial findings to the local partner about the lives of the people they work with and they have said this is useful in their thinking about project development.

We have connected the local partner to cultural activities that show the complexity of the conflicts and then helped them think through the way in which this connection can help them break out of the 'bubble' of international organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AB55E165-4D24-46C8-935F-DFBD9B623B94</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key findings from the research so far.
1. The work of the local partner in Civilian ceasefire monitoring is very innovative and is the first time it has been done in this manner, with local people leading in most components, in the world, and will in itself make a useful and exciting case study.

2. The importance of narrative in understanding conflict. As we asked people 'how did you learn about the conflict because none of us is born with knowledge about conflict, the importance of narratives became clear. For some they grew up (particularly those who grew up outside Yangon), saw the conflict, the military and heard from family and community leaders about identity and stories were passed on through ethnic festivals. For others, particularly those growing up in Yangon, they may have only found out later, for example when at University.
People told us of their internal struggle against the messages of having been told to 'fear' or 'hate' another group, but not wanting to do that, and wanting to build relationships with them. Several of the artists told us they wanted to work with the children. Through the stories from people we are exploring how culture reinforces or challenges the dominant narratives. 

3.That culture is a useful entry point to explore peace and conflict. It gave us insight into the resistance and peace movement as well as those involved in the conflict resolution, dialogue and peacebuilding which is more traditionally analysed in conflict analysis. The examples of culture we found (but have not fully analysed yet) are textiles from different ethnic communities, traditional stories reproduced for peace education, using song both in performance and as a tool for people working together on projects, art as a tool for conflict transformation, 

4.That our research methodology draws on both cultural studies and feminist studies, which is enabling us to understand more about the ways in which lived experience and the power of researchers relates to the way we research in peace and conflict.

5.The immense complexities of the many conflicts.
As well as that between ethnic groups and the military, the are generational conflicts between the old and young, gender conflicts as women want to change their roles, poverty, drugs, oppression, environmental and resource conflicts, religious, city-rural,and identify. Every place we visited told us a more complex picture of the entwined nature of the conflicts. One person described Myanmar as a series of walls of conflict, but once once is knocked down there is one behind it, or like an onion. Another described how personal every conflict is, and that perception is as important as image.

6.That the international media representation of of the conflicts is not representative of the issues facing people in Myanmar. That some international work is limited by the government restrictions and only meeting the same circle of people, so a way of learning about the lived experience and lives of the people could be a way of expanding international perspectives.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>At the moment we are working on the routes to present findings to international agencies through their meetings and in Yangon, and to the local partners in Kachin state using presentations, printed media.
