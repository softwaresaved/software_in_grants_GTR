differential equations model a process evolving in time and subject to a random noise. Numerous phenomena in nature and economics are modelled by these equations. The reason for the random noise might be found in external or internal fluctuations which do not allow a deterministic description, in random events in the future or in uncertainty of the model. The complexity of the model, e.g. the numbers of parameters involved or the state space of the modelled process, often results in the necessity to consider stochastic differential equations in infinite dimensional spaces. However, up to now, most of these models are restricted to a continuous Gaussian noise and to infinite dimensional spaces with a very rich structure due to the lack of a satisfactory mathematical theory.The first objective of this project is to develop a theory which enables us to treat stochastic differential equations in infinite dimensional spaces of a general type. The random source might have discontinuous paths and is allowed to be of a very general form, such that the randomness not only depends on the evolution in time but also on the underlying space. In the second part of this project, the usability of the theory is verified by studying two concrete examples out of the numerous applications: one model describes the physical distribution of the heat in a given region subject to some external random noise, and the second model originates from financial mathematics and describes the evolution of interest rate curves.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outputs of this project have the potential to establish more realistic models with a better accordance to observed data, in turn impacting the numerous fields where stochastic differential equations in infinite dimensions are applied. Consequently, the outcomes of the project can be expected to have an impact not just within academia but also in the economy, industry and government where these models are applied.An important part of the project is the development of software for sampling methods and numerical approximations for the forward curves and prices of interest rate derivatives in a significantly improved model. The algorithms will be provided to the financial package em Premia, which has been used by a consortium of banks, including Credit Agricole, Societe Generale and Bank Austria. After two years the software becomes available on Premia's web site and can be freely downloaded for academic purposes.In modern areas of financial mathematics and related fields, such as real option theory, climatology and resource exploitation, the complexity of the models seem to be captured better by stochastic differential equations in infinite dimensional spaces. An important part of the proposed project is to explore the possibility of improving and of understanding the models in these and other non-standard areas by using an infinite dimensional approach. For this purpose, the PI will initiate several cooperations with groups working in these areas and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Computational and Dynamical Analysis at the University of Manchester along with its industrial contacts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100568</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leoben (Montanuniversit?t Leoben)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Austria, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Working on the 4th milestone of the project</gtr:description><gtr:id>C01FB034-55C3-4EBD-9B28-C3F8BFBC05F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration focuses on the completion of milestone 4, which requires results from Milestone 3. Due to the delay of completing Milestone 3 because of unexpected difficulties, the work of this collaboration on milestone 4 is at an intermediate level. However, we discussed the possibilities to apply standard methods, such as Euler scheme or Galerkin approximation and which are well developed for the Gaussian noise, to the cylindrical noise treated in this project. As the work on milestone 3 is now almost completed we plan to continue the work on this part of the project soon, if possible. 

 the approximation of stochastic partial differential equations driven by classical noise</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The collaborator taught different methods to approximate and simulate solutions of stochastic partial differential equations driven by classical noises, in particular Gaussian noises. These methods are important for a numerical scheme, but often they also establish the existence of a solution.

In particular, we have identified a possible approach to tackle this problem, which is based on a recent publication by J. Rosinksi and A. Basse-O'Connor. This approach also uses tangent sequences, and thus it might benefit from the technique developed in the collaboration Working on the 3rd milestone of the project (see Collaboration &amp;amp; Partnershps).

These results will have an impact on the research covered by Milestone 4 in the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The host taught a counterexample that the radonification procedure for the increments of the stochastic integral cannot be applied if the integrator does not have independent increments. This underpins that our approach in the collaboration Working on the 3rd milestone of the project (see Collaboration &amp;amp; Partnerships) with A. Jakubowski (Torun) is promising, as it is strongly based on the independence of integrand and increments of the integrator. Moreover, the host developed together with the PI an important counterexample on extension of cylindrical measures to Radon measures, which might have surprising consequences for the uniqueness of the stochastic Cauchy problem driven by cylindrical Levy processes, which is considered in milestone 5.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Introduce the approach to cylindrical Levy processes as developed together with D.

In order to develop this theory, we introduced a new technique using tangent sequences in order to establish tightness in Hilbert spaces. Further properties of the stochastic integrals, such as the existence of a version with cadlag paths, are also established in this work. These outcomes correspond to the successful completion of the Milestone 3. The results will be published in Annals of Probability.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The collaborator taught several aspects of tightness in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. In particular, in many sessions he taught important aspects on tangent sequences and tightness, which were part of his PhD thesis in 1982 and which is only available in Polish. This technique is the key technique which enables us to develop a satisfactory theory of stochastic integration with respect to cylindrical Levy processes, i.e. which means the successful completion of Milestone 3.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The PI introduced the approach to cylindrical Levy processes as developed together with D.

The audience was very interested in the PI's novel approach by cylindrical processes and a lively discussion sparked with several colleagues.

This conference was very important for the project since the most important and most influential group of researchers in this area are in Poland and attended this conference.

The PI was invited to Krakow for a research stay by one of the international leading experts on stochastic differential equations driven by Levy processes. This resulted in the Engagement Activities CNRS-PAN Mathematics Summer Institute (Krakow).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>paper presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://bcc.impan.pl/13Zabczyk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2200</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Workshop Grant (2013)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>London Mathematical Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0FAD0996-7918-4340-AF2C-C48D99E0DB1F</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>6500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Workshop Grant (2014)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>London Mathematical Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0CB04610-0546-43A6-9D46-894AC709F26B</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Due to the unexpected difficulties in establishing a satisfactory theory of stochastic integration, the successful completion of milestone 3 has been delayed. As a consequence the work on milestone 6 could not start during the project. Since the anticipated results of milestone 6 were identified as the ones with the highest potential on impact beyond academia (economics), the project has so far only influenced the research in academia in different disciplines. Currently, I am working on milestone 4 which will enable to consider milestone 6.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6315D525-8160-4EE0-9A16-FC8F4AE74373</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication
