Hemes belong to a family of essential life pigment involved in many basic respiratory processes. This application aims to decipher a twenty-year mystery by unravelling the pathway leading to their synthesis. Specifically we aim to elucidate how heme and heme d1 are made in the Archaea and a number of eubacteria. Heme was previously thought to be synthesized along a single pathway from a compound called uroporphyrinogen III by a series of enzymes that modify the acidic side chains, oxidize the macrocycle and insert ferrous iron. However, we have recently demonstrated that heme and a structurally related macrocycle, heme d1, can be made by a completely novel pathway that involves the cannibalism of another modified tetrapyrrole, a compound called siroheme, the prosthetic group of sulphite and nitrite reductase. There are many novel features to this project that make it compelling. The transformation of siroheme into heme and heme d1 requires a number of radical SAM enzymes coupled with a decarboxylase, involving some highly unusual steps that are unprecedented in biological chemistry. The aim of this project is to understand in molecular detail the step-by-step synthesis of hemes along this pathway. Although the d1 heme is only found in the cytochrome cd1, the importance of this enzyme is becoming ever more evident as it vital for the environmentally important ANAMMOX process whereby ammonia is oxidised by nitrite under anaerobic conditions and has recently been implicated in playing a key role in the anaerobic oxidation of methane. It is believed that d1 heme has been adopted for respiratory nitrite reduction because it is tuned to permit nitrite reduction only as far as nitric oxide and not to allow the onward reduction to ammonia that is catalysed by siroheme. The discovery that siroheme is also a precursor for d1 synthesis therefore raises many interesting evolutionary and regulatory questions. Overall, the outcome of this research will result in the composition of a molecular overture of events for a new heme synthesis route, explain more clearly the relationship between heme and siroheme and provide a neodarwinistic understanding of complex biosynthetic pathways. It will also help maintain the UK at the cutting edge of biomolecular science research and maintain the position our groups have as world leaders in this field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Modified tetrapyrroles play essential roles in many different molecular processes. Despite their prevelance, there is still much to learn about the biosynthesis of these macrocycles. In a whole kingdom of life (the Archaea and also sulfate reducing bacteria) we do not even know how heme is made, but we know that it must be made along an alternative heme biosynthetic pathway since the genes from the classic pathway found in eukaryotes, for instance, are missing. In this application we plan an investigation into the relationship between the biosynthesis of siroheme, heme d1 and heme. We have recently shown that siroheme is, in fact, an intermediate in the synthesis of both heme and d1 heme and we have outlined a testable hypothesis to investigate this further. Previous research had identified a gene cluster responsible for heme d1 synthesis, which includes nirDL, E, F, G, H, J. More recently we undertook a bioinformatics comparison of the Archaea and the sulfate reducing bacteria and identified four genes that are likely involved in the alternative heme biosynthesis pathway (ahbA-D). Surprisingly, we found similarity between the genes of d1 and the alternative heme synthesis, indicating either commonality in some of the intermediates or similarity in the mechanisms employed. The research outlined in this application aims to investigate the individual steps involved in the transformation of siroheme into both d1 and heme. The initial step sees the decarboxylation of siroheme into a compound called didecarboxysiroheme (DDSH). Thereafter, DDSH undergoes a range of modifications to its peripheral side chains to give either heme or d1. These steps involve some unusual chemistry, which will be investigated during the course of the project.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research will be workers in academia and industry who are interested in chemical and synthetic biology and their applications. There is a current strong interest in these areas and science needs to put forward a strong representation in terms of the positive contributions that they can make. The research outlined in this project makes such a contribution since it investigates roles of synthetic pathways and brings the prospect of manipulation to enhance levels of the end product. Such approaches and strategies are relevant in biotechnology and bioprocessing industries. Moreover, the novel enzyme activities that are involved in the heme and d1 assembly pathways may also be relevant to assembling other kinds of cyclic molecules. If this proves to be the case then we will ensure that our findings are widely disseminated, through, for example, short review articles. Furthermore, there is no doubt that d1 heme is vital for the operation of the Anammox process which is key for waste water treatment. Thus we will ensure that our findings are disseminated to those working in waste water treatment. Knowledge of d1 assembly is important for that field as if it were inadvertently inhibited then clearly the process would be blocked. On the other hand, blocking this activity would be relevant to understanding how Pseudomonas aeruginosa might be controlled during infections. Thus we will also publicise our findings to the medical field by presenting work at meetings dealing with infection. The Ferguson group offers placements for 6th formers and will ensure that major developments are publicised on the regularly updated Departmental web site.The skills acquired by those involved in this project include not only a wide range of important biological techniques ranging from spectroscopy and structural biology through to microbiology and recombinant DNA technology but also the chance to contribute towards a basic understanding of bacterial physiology. The knowledge and techniques will provide those employed with skills that can be used across education and industry. The intellectual property resulting from this project will be protected and used via the University's ISIS office. The research will be published in high impact journals and oral communications given at international conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>343800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This grant is still current and not suprisingly at this stage our findings have not been exploited by others in either academic or non-academic spheres.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F114663B-4436-439A-BD44-FFA35BB4D883</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Heme is a small molecule containing iron and perhaps best known for its role in carrying oxygen in hemoglobin of the blood. In earlier work we discovered a new pathway for making heme in a variety of organisms. This pathway involved a molecule known as siroheme. We wanted to understand how this molecule can be converted to heme. The first step is didecarboxylation. We solved the structure of this enzyme and have thus gained insights iinto how it works. Strangely it looks a little bit like a protein that binds to DNA. We also wanted to find out how the siroheme is made in certain groups of bacteria where previously known enzymes for this process are absent. We succeeded in identifying the enzyme in these organisms. Siroheme is not only an intermediate for making heme but also for the molecule d1 heme that is found in denitrifying bacteria. The double decarboxylation of siroheme is shared by the d1 biosynthesis pathway. At the time of writing we have preliminary data on the roles of other proteins on the d1 biogenesis pathway. There are many novel kinds of reaction catalysed on this pathway.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As the grant is not yet finished it is early to say. We have advanced our understanding of how d1 heme is made and also how a key step, decarbxylation of siroheme in both the d1 heme synthesis pathway and an alternate heme biosynthesis pathway, occurs. All these findings lay the foundations for either us or our competitors to take forward further studies to elucidate further steps in these pathways. A particularly intriguing feature is the suggestion that one of the enzymes we have studied may have a dula role as a DNA biinding protein. This is a novel phenomena and will be followed up.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1727EA1E-D96A-4AFD-B8D7-0866BBFDEB38</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1D116E23-0A3C-4BAF-91F4-7A2A6BCB1FB0"><gtr:id>1D116E23-0A3C-4BAF-91F4-7A2A6BCB1FB0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The structure, function and properties of sirohaem decarboxylase--an enzyme with structural homology to a transcription factor family that is part of the alternative haem biosynthesis pathway.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/419593634fe13fe2253b7aba38904bcd"><gtr:id>419593634fe13fe2253b7aba38904bcd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Palmer DJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-382X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/98D3918B-654B-4ECB-99E6-4FA879BF26A5"><gtr:id>98D3918B-654B-4ECB-99E6-4FA879BF26A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Recent advances in the biosynthesis of modified tetrapyrroles: the discovery of an alternative pathway for the formation of heme and heme d 1.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ae3e37a869079ec80be691960817c572"><gtr:id>ae3e37a869079ec80be691960817c572</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bali S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1420-682X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/600FBE44-4088-4CD1-ACB9-0F69A7CCCA42"><gtr:id>600FBE44-4088-4CD1-ACB9-0F69A7CCCA42</gtr:id><gtr:title>Siroheme as an intermediate in the biogenesis of heme and heme d1; a new branch of tetrapyrrole synthesis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>FEBS J</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/74b717ad7f5922a002fcd5fca86ce11d"><gtr:id>74b717ad7f5922a002fcd5fca86ce11d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>BALI S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B4BC1CF3-DFB5-417E-8B5B-4FFFD3D2C63C"><gtr:id>B4BC1CF3-DFB5-417E-8B5B-4FFFD3D2C63C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase NirS is involved in anaerobic magnetite biomineralization in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense and requires NirN for proper d1 heme assembly.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of bacteriology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bd75dbe105014309cbdded985198a393"><gtr:id>bd75dbe105014309cbdded985198a393</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9193</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2FED0942-012F-48E6-94F7-00314C303142"><gtr:id>2FED0942-012F-48E6-94F7-00314C303142</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identification and characterization of the 'missing' terminal enzyme for siroheme biosynthesis in a-proteobacteria.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ae3e37a869079ec80be691960817c572"><gtr:id>ae3e37a869079ec80be691960817c572</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bali S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-382X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I021736/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
