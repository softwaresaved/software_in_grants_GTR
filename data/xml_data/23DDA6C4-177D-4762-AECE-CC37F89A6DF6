Historically, Timor has recurrently evoked El Dorado-like dreams of great resource wealth, which until recently were never realised. When the country re-gained independence in 2002, the government managed to secure a 50% share in revenues from its offshore oil and gas reserves that Australia had claimed. Even though negotiations with Australia are still ongoing, the East Timorese government is currently planning to build a large industrial complex to bring oil and gas from offshore fields in the Timor Sea to its shores. The planned scheme has given rise to a great sense of anticipation that Timor-Leste's oil wealth will facilitate the development of a modern and prosperous nation. The aim of this study is to examine these visions of the future ethnographically and to explore how public expectations are articulated in relation to pre-existing ideas about the sacred significance of the lived environment. It seeks to advance anthropological debates about resource extraction and related expectations of modernity by investigating how local logics inform national imaginaries of modernity and how government promises foster utopian dreams of sudden societal transformations. 

The Petroleum Corridor is the centrepiece of the national Strategic Development Plan for 2020, and envisages the development of three industrial clusters on the thinly populated southwest coast of the country. Plans include the building of a supply base, a pipeline, a port, an oil refinery, a petrochemical complex, an LNG plant and a modern four-lane highway. Residents along the highway route and around the sites of the new facilities would be relocated to grid-planned 'new cities'. Hence despite the great sense of hope connected to the petroleum industry, concerns have been raised that affected populations will loose their land and that the planned resettlement may intensify current conflicts over land ownership. This research aims to document existing tensions over resource entitlements, information that is essential for securing the livelihoods of rural communities and to establish a socially responsible extraction industry. 

Today, Timor-Leste is the second most petroleum-dependent country in the world, yet 50 per cent of the population live below the poverty line. This has given rise to warnings that the country will soon be subject to the 'resource curse', a term used to describe the problems oil-rich economies face as they become dependent on import with little investment in agriculture and other economic sectors. Similarly, most current social science studies approach the topic of petroleum by examining the corruption, violent conflicts, environmental destruction and social inequalities that this 'cursed' resource can engender. While these analyses are important, they tend to draw a rather absolute distinction between state-planners on the one hand, and local communities that are marginalised by these projects on the other. By contrast, the focus of this project is on the expectations and aspirations that are connected to natural resources, identifying not just the concerns that the growth of the petroleum industry creates, but also the anticipation and hope that such schemes evoke. It will do so by teasing out the differences between state and local perspectives as well as taking into account variations in attitudes among affected populations. An ethnographic study of divergent public attitudes towards the petroleum industry may help to avoid its potentially adverse impact, ensuring that people benefit from the country's wealth in ways that they themselves desire, thereby fostering peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region more generally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this project will be the research participants, since the project will document the concerns, expectations and land claims of the rural populations affected by the construction of the Petroleum Corridor. Additional beneficiaries include the private and public sectors in Timor-Leste, as well as national and international organisations that have an interest in establishing socially responsible resource extraction industries. 

The PI will communicate her findings to a wide range of stakeholders, at a time when potential users are open to such ideas and will provide timely, evidence-based policy recommendations to key stakeholders on how to maximise local participation in the development of the petroleum industry. The project has the potential to improve community empowerment; develop mechanisms to ensure compliance with social responsibility recommendations; increase transparency and accountability; decrease the risk of conflict; ensure that smallholders gain some legal security with regard to land ownership; and hence seek to contribute to the promotion of long-term peace in the Asia-Pacific region more generally.

Key stakeholders and beneficiaries: 

1. Affected Communities
The research will allow affected populations living in the areas of the Petroleum Corridor to communicate their concerns and expectations to policymakers, civil society groups and corporations. 
2. Governmental institutions and the private sector in Timor-Leste 
The primary goal of the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is to maximise community participation in the petroleum industry. Given the timing of this project, research findings should be ideally placed to influence political debates, and to make specific policy recommendations to the government and the private sector on how local concerns can be integrated into the planning and realisation of the Tasi Mane project. 
3. Civil society and non-governmental organisation in Timor-Leste 
The qualitative data generated by this project will complement existing research by non-governmental organisations in Timor-Leste, which monitor and analyse the government's policy on petroleum, agriculture and land ownership. It will help them to lobby the government on how to protect the rights of the affected communities and to avoid adverse effects of the 'resource curse'.
4. International organisations and corporations 
Oil companies face increasing pressure to include corporate and social responsibility mechanisms in their practices, whereas international development organisations have an interest in protecting community land rights, alleviating poverty, enhancing economic development worldwide and establishing socially responsible resource extraction industries. These beneficiaries will be able to use the project's findings when planning investments in the country, when designing aid programmes and when consulting with policymakers. 

Collaboration with beneficiaries: 
A) User Involvement in Research Design: the PI will consult with the stakeholder groups throughout the duration of the fellowship. This will include: individual consultative meetings; workshops at the beginning and end of field research; consultation with an advisory group made up of selected stakeholders. 
B) Capacity Building: the PI will recruit three East Timorese field researchers, provide research method training and involve them in the organisation of project events. To enhance local research capacity, she will organise a Writing and Publication Workshop for East Timorese scholars in 2017. 
C) User-appropriate Dissemination and Outputs: 'Plan for Participation and Social Responsibility' to be disseminated to stakeholder group 2; 'Final Report' for stakeholder groups 3 and 4 that outline the findings of the research; dissemination of findings through social media (an interactive blog) and community radio; short articles to be written for newsletters and international political journals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>231055</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visions of the Future in Timor-Leste</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>55807AFE-0ACD-4460-AAE6-6ADFC5D06E21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Five-day international symposium bringing together scholars to discuss the significance of contemporary developments in Timor-Leste.

Abstract 
Unlike many environmental researchers who have long been trying to come up with analytical models based on visions of coming times, anthropologists have only recently started to recognise the importance of studying how assumptions about the future affect the ways societies govern their domestic, national and global resources. The ways in which people imagine the future affects and transforms how they lead their lives in the present. This is particularly true in Timor-Leste, where visions of the future, especially visions of independence, freedom and self-determination, but also visions of wealth and prosperity, have long inspired actions in the present. Recently new nationalist and hyper-modernist visions have emerged in the country, such as the Tasi Mane project in the south coast or the free trade zone in Oecussi. Such visions shape the ways in which resources and people are managed. They raise hopes and expectations about the kind of change and development that such projects may bring, while also drawing on pre-existing notions that the mobilization of subterranean wealth may usher radical societal transformation. Yet, these projects have also raised concerns among civil society groups about the social, economic and environmental problems such projects may bring. The focus of this workshop is not exclusively on state visions of the future, but seeks to tease out the various religious, economic and political ways in which the expectations of the future in Timor-Leste motivate action in the present. 

This workshop is aimed at bringing together scholars with recent research experience in Timor-Leste, focusing on current political, economic and environmental transformations in the country. Even though the framing of the workshop is largely informed by a political and economic anthropology perspective, it is also open to approaches from other disciplines, such as history, political science, sociology, geography and others. 

The symposium put in place special (financial) support for scholars and policy-makers from Timor-Leste to be able to attend.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of work at the Timor-Leste Studies Association conference in Dili, July 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0364DAEA-6408-4DD0-BA8C-3F21F39878A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The TLSA Research Conference takes place in Dili, Timor-Leste every two years.
