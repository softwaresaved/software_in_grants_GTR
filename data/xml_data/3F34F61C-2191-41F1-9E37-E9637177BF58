However, the magnitude of this benefit has been recently questioned, since long-term and indirect effects may considerably reduce any GHG savings generated by the cropping system. Indeed, impacts on soil C have been identified as the weak link in life-cycle analysis of net carbon-equivalent benefit presented by bioenergy. Changes in rates of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emission are relevant too since they have a large GHG warming potential, but these changes are mostly unquantified for perennial bioenergy cropping systems. Although several soil carbon and trace-gas models have been developed for agricultural and conventional forest systems these have not been parameterized and validated for transition of land-use to perennial bioenergy crops. To predict the changes in SOC that will occur one to three decades after establishing biomass crops, we need to establish (a) differences in turnover dynamics and fluxes of carbon under key biomass crops in terms of amount, quality and placement of carbon into the soil from the plant, and (b) mechanisms to overcome short-term loss of pre-existing soil carbon during transition (c) quantitative, process-based modeling approaches that are predictive, to explore future scenarios for optimum soil carbon management. The overarching aim of this project is to provide improved understanding of fundamental soil processes resulting in changes of soil carbon stocks and pools as a result of land conversion from arable/grassland to land-based renewables. The project focuses on impacts of land use change specifically to perennial bioenergy crops (fast growing SRC trees and grasses) where there is currently a significant knowledge gap. This project will generate new evidence to improve current understanding on how soil carbon processes, sequestration and emission, are affected by the introduction of perennial energy crops. The soil carbon balance is key to informing the debate on whether using these crops for bioenergy and biofuels will result in significant carbon savings compared to land use for food crops and the use of fossil fuels for heat, power and liquid fuels. In the long-term (beyond the life of this project), this will enable dynamic, spatially explicit modeling of GHG (C equivalents, abbreviated here as C) mitigation potential of land-based bioenergy systems across different climates and soil types of the UK. We wish to develop 'Carbon Opportunity Maps' for the UK. The work of the project will be undertaken in three workpackages dealing with data synthesis (WP1), experimental data collection (WP2) and modeling (WP3). Throughout the project we will use leverage of other resources including two flagship sites at Brattleby and Aberystwyth, where commercial-scale plantations are established and where several long-term measuring and monitoring activities are underway funded from elsewhere. Similarly, the modeling resources from within the project are extensive and funded from other sources that will be levered against the work here. They included DNDC, JULES, ROTH C and on-going modeling approaches for miscanthus and SRC. Outputs will include a new database of synthesized data for soil carbon under bioenergy crops. We will have tested and calibrated process-based models that are capable of simulating the dynamics of soil organic carbon, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions for perennial bioenergy crops in the UK. We will provide increased fundamental understanding of soil processes occurring under bioenergy cropping systems including the role of mycorrhizal associations and the effectiveness of biochar as a potential to optimize soil carbon and plant growth. We will develop capacity for future 'carbon opportunity' mapping.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>127337</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Information gained on biochar priming effects within energy crops have informed policy stakeholders in central Government via stakeholder meetings, the Energy Technologies Institute and more recently the Climate Change Committee.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F4D99E48-2920-48AC-B2F5-11D355BF1684</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Organic carbon finds a natural &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; in soil, that is a balance between current land use (amount going in from plants) and decomposition (by microbes). This means that some years after conversion of land to crops that support higher inputs to soil, or inputs that are placed into soil that is less disrupted by arable agriculture, the stocks of carbon in soil may have increased. This is a site specific matter, which can be assessed in its generality using a chronosequence approach. We applied this approach to understand the effects of conversion of UK farm land from grass or cereal crops to two energy crops, willow and elephant grass. We have established small changes over periods of up to two decades. Boosting soil carbon storage should be more effectively achieved by adding pre-stabilized organic matter to soil. This shortcuts the natural acquisition of stability which takes decades. The repeated working over by microbes that is involved increases stability but also results in the incremental, progressive emission of most of the organic matter as CO2. Making biochar involves heating crop residues to create a type of charcoal, the natural much less efficient analogue being the creation of charcoal in wildfire, which over time has created a giant store of black carbon. By making biochar additions at all our chronosequence sites, we were firstly able to assess the near-term effects of biochar in diverse soils - and secondly, to create sites useful for the future verification of long-term storage of biochar carbon as well as any more enduring effects on other soil processes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The network of referenced micro plots exist in the field and will over time, provide a resource for understanding the fate and behavior in the longer term, of black carbon purposefully added to soil. all of the soils are in a land-use transition, which will progressively move towards equilibrium. The effect of changing soil organic matter status as well as different organic matter status on the interactions of black carbon can be examined. These are plots that will have been under continuous perennial crop cover, where the interactions of roots and soil physical fractions can evolve over time. All of these may be the subject of future projects, where the costs of deployment and the effects of time are already assured.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0D0F191A-A3A6-414D-BA38-81152F381F3F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.carbobiocrop.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BA55B2E7-FCA7-48F6-915B-4EAFF43B974F"><gtr:id>BA55B2E7-FCA7-48F6-915B-4EAFF43B974F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of land-use change for lignocellulosic biomass crop production on soil organic carbon stocks in Britain</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6778b454fba110b5cb2f8da463a92ba0"><gtr:id>6778b454fba110b5cb2f8da463a92ba0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McClean GJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/94EAAA4E-6E20-41B9-A85A-13CE22F80040"><gtr:id>94EAAA4E-6E20-41B9-A85A-13CE22F80040</gtr:id><gtr:title>Proceedings of EuroSoil 2012</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The effects of land conversion to bioenergy crops on soil carbon</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6778b454fba110b5cb2f8da463a92ba0"><gtr:id>6778b454fba110b5cb2f8da463a92ba0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McClean GJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/81641200-7AC3-4474-9DD4-9C58E7219DFC"><gtr:id>81641200-7AC3-4474-9DD4-9C58E7219DFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The priming potential of environmentally weathered pyrogenic carbon during land-use transition to biomass crop production</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>GCB Bioenergy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/eeff65f4c12d64ec473e6c4dacd94df4"><gtr:id>eeff65f4c12d64ec473e6c4dacd94df4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McClean G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/971D93D9-C6E7-43A4-96E7-EA9C74B008EC"><gtr:id>971D93D9-C6E7-43A4-96E7-EA9C74B008EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>An empirical model approach for assessing soil organic carbon stock changes following biomass crop establishment in Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biomass and Bioenergy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/eeff65f4c12d64ec473e6c4dacd94df4"><gtr:id>eeff65f4c12d64ec473e6c4dacd94df4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McClean G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/114435AE-32DD-43F0-8917-42D82D24DACB"><gtr:id>114435AE-32DD-43F0-8917-42D82D24DACB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Temporal soil organic carbon dynamics following land-use change for lignocellulosic bioenergy production</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6778b454fba110b5cb2f8da463a92ba0"><gtr:id>6778b454fba110b5cb2f8da463a92ba0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McClean GJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F8C336D0-CADF-4551-A6AB-11A7EDA1A622"><gtr:id>F8C336D0-CADF-4551-A6AB-11A7EDA1A622</gtr:id><gtr:title>Estimating soil bulk density for lignocellulosic biomass crops in Britain using pedotransfer functions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geoderma</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6778b454fba110b5cb2f8da463a92ba0"><gtr:id>6778b454fba110b5cb2f8da463a92ba0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McClean GJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/H010785/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E4C03353-6311-43F9-9204-CFC2536D2017</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atmospheric phys. &amp;
