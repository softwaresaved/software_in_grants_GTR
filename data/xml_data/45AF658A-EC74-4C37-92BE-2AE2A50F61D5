In order these high gains to be achieved, efficient use of silicon should be performed when such algorithms are mapped onto hardware. Even though this topic is well researched for the case of deterministic algorithms, no work has been done for algorithms of a stochastic nature. The fundamental problem that this proposal addresses is the efficiently use of silicon when a stochastic algorithm is mapped to hardware.This proposal is concerned with the design automation of hardware architectures for Monte Carlo based simulations of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). Domains such as the stochastic modelling of chemical reactions and financial engineering are two examples where SDEs are widely used. Due to the non-existence or to high complexity in deriving an analytic solution for an SDE, numerical techniques based on computationally heavy Monte Carlo simulations are often employed. Hardware systems based on reconfigurable logic have demonstrated good potential for the acceleration and power consumption reduction of the above simulations. The main technique that is often employed and contributes to the realization of high performance gains and significant power consumption reduction is the use of a customized number representation system.This project aims to investigate two key issues related to the use Field Programmable Gate Arrays, a reconfigurable hardware device, for acceleration of Monte Carlo simulations for Stochastic Differential Equations. The first issue is the impact of the employed number representation on the quality of the SDE solution using Monte Carlo simulations, while the second key issue is to research and develop hardware architectures and word-length optimization techniques that target the minimization of power usage or the maximization of the performance of the system, without significant loss on the quality of the solution. By optimizing the computational part of the hardware system, efficient allocation of the available resources is performed, resulting in the acceleration of the overall simulation and improved energy consumption per computational operation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98307</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>One of the key findings of the project is that stochastic algorithms can hide errors in the computations, when special care has been taken in the design of the system/algorithm. This key idea has been applied to a body of work that focuses on the acceleration of stochastic algorithms and especially the acceleration of MCMC algorithms. In the proposed systems, where the outcomes of this project have been utilised, significant speed ups have been achieved, leading to system that can provide to the users the ability to analyse large amount of data in a fraction of the time.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>71BCB61F-5152-42F5-BD46-52BA75576BF2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and specialised computing devices that can be programmed in the field and implement any type of computer architecture. Thus, in contrast to mainstream general processors that need to be able to perform a large variety of operations, FPGAs can be tuned to the specific application and deliver high computational power with low power consumption. The project investigated how real-time tuning of the number representation employed by a design can lead to enhanced performance when parallel stochastic simulations are targeted. The results of the project showed that by tuning online the precision of the computations a 35% improvement can be achieved for the above target domain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The idea of tuning the precision of the computations at real time by monitoring various metrics can be applied to many fields.
