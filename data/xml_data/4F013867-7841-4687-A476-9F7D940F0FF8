The project focusses on riboflavin, its interaction with two closely related vitamins - vitamin B6 and folate - and a related gene-nutrient interaction, with important implications for health. In the context of the overall diet, milk and dairy foods - the only rich sources of dietary riboflavin - will be of particular relevance.

Health Impact
The proposed research is well aligned with the goal of promoting health and wellness in adults in Europe and Associated countries. Recent evidence suggests that low riboflavin status may be a much greater public health issue globally than is generally recognised. There are considerable implications for those most at risk of low intake and status of riboflavin, including adults generally who do not consume adequate intakes of milk and dairy foods, and particularly young women of reproductive age. Of note, riboflavin has an important role in one-carbon metabolism where it interacts with other relevant nutrients (i.e. folate and vitamin B6) and is required for normal functioning of the essential pathways dependent on these nutrients. Thus better riboflavin status is likely to have important roles in maintaining health throughout the lifecycle and in preventing disease including cancer, age-related cataracts and metabolic disorders leading to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The contribution of riboflavin to health is however very much under-recognised at this time, and the evidence greatly lacking, due to the lack of an accessible biomarker to measure riboflavin status. The proposed project will addresses this gap, by validating riboflavin biomarkers for use in the current proposal and in future nutrition research internationally.

Personalized nutrition: a novel role of riboflavin in health
The project will bring together cross-sectional data on blood pressure with genetic, nutrient, blood biomarker and relevant clinical information in well-characterized cohorts. This new knowledge will
provide important evidence to support a personalized nutritional strategy for preventing hypertension in genetically at-risk adults, with potential impacts on risk of disease in ageing (especially stroke),
pregnancy outcomes, healthcare economics, and quality of life throughout the lifecycle.

Societal and other impacts
Leadership within Europe and Associated countries. The proposal brings together researchers with complementary expertise to engage in diet and health research at a pan-European and
international level.
Improving scientific capacity and capability within Europe and Internationally: The proposed project will establish a critical mass of expertise in this research area, allowing for excellent
science and sharing of innovative approaches and infrastructures, and the data gathered willbe made available to the wider research community. It will also offer excellent experience and
training to early career scientists and PhD students in nutrition, and thus contribute to strengthening the research base in the health and agri-food sectors.
The scientific publications arising from this research will also provide important benefits to the wider research community by providing comprehensive data reporting important nutrition and
health relationships in very well characterised observational cohorts, along with evidence of the potential benefits of improving micronutrient status for better health outcomes as demonstrated
in intervention cohorts.
Collaboration with industry and Enhanced competitiveness in the Agri-food sector: The new biomarkers of dietary riboflavin intake validated in the current project will be essential for substantiating Article 14 health claims for evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>207521</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P028241/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>446B7E7F-04EB-4121-9CC6-9171277E00DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diet &amp; health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
