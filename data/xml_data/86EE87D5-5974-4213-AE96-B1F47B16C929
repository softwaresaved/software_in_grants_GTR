A recent review of the literature highlighted some of the key skill-based differences that have been reported both in regard to how performers allocate limited attention resources within the visual field and the manner in which the different components of visual system (i.e., the fovea, parafovea and periphery) are employed to capture relevant information to guide action. Of particular interest in aiming tasks is the work on the quiet eye period (QE), defined as the final fixation on the target prior to initiation of the obligatory motor response toward the target. A longer QE period, with an earlier onset of QE has been consistently reported to characterise expert performance, as well as performance outcome. During this time, it is proposed that the movement parameters for the required action are set. However, despite the plethora of research on QE, the underlying mechanisms and neural activity present during this behaviour are unknown. By increasing our knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning the effective use of vision, in particular QE, we can explore how training programmes can be designed to facilitate performance across numerous domains. The current project aims to identify the functional and neural mechanisms of QE, and how these interact with stress, specifically anxiety, and whether we can use this knowledge to expedite skill learning and modify behaviour.

In Phase One of this project, we will examine whether QE can protect against distracting stimuli, to keep the performer focused on the task-relevant cues. Subsequently, we will use brain-imaging techniques to highlight key areas of the brain that are activated during QE. We will compare gaze behaviours and neural activation between elite and sub-elite archers using an aiming task. This will enable us to identify structural differences in behaviours between skill levels. 

In Phase Two of this project, we will use the same task as in Phase One, but test archers in the real-world environment. We will also manipulate anxiety via financial incentives and peer-based competition. This will enable us to identify how the mechanisms identified in Phase One are affected by stressors. By comparing between skill levels, it will enable us to identify how anxiety is mediated by expertise.

In Phase Three of this project, based on the data gathered from the previous phases, we will design and implement training interventions which aim to improve the gaze behaviours of sub-elite athletes. Specifically, we will attempt to modify QE behaviour to promote effective and efficient attention control. We will also monitor brain activation throughout the intervention to identify any neurological changes that occur as a result of training.

The project will identify the mechanisms underpinning expert performance in aiming skills and determine whether learning can be expedited through trans-magnetic simulation and behavioural modifications. Our work will highlight the neural activation during QE for the first time, enabling the development and monitoring of superior skill. Moreover, the project will improve conceptual understanding of how performance is influenced by anxiety and whether, and in what manner, any negative effects may be mediated by expertise. The knowledge generated will help refine and develop methods employed to improve perceptual and cognitive skills in other professional fields such as the military, law enforcement, emergency services, medicine/healthcare, as well as in education and training more generally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In aiming tasks, the final fixation on a target before the initiation of action (quiet eye period; QE) has been shown to differentiate expertise and performance levels. A prolonged QE may permit task-salient cues to be prioritised so that cortical resources are likely reallocated away from irrelevant sensory cues and toward the visuospatially dominant processes critical for effective motor programming. However, the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie the behaviour have never been systematically examined. We have recently shown how TMS can be used in conjunction with fMRI imaging to reveal both the interactivity and necessary role of different brain regions in human attentional control. The current project will utilise these advanced neuroscientific procedures to elucidate the necessary role of different brain regions in QE behaviour. In Phase One, we will carry out behavioural studies, which aim to evaluate whether one effect of QE behaviour is to facilitate the filtering-out of irrelevant distraction and whether this ability varies with expertise. We examine the neural structures that are recruited under QE conditions and how these interact with crowding effects. Subsequently, we combine TMS with fMRI to test the necessary role of the different brain regions identified. In Phase Two, we will assess how increases in anxiety interact with QE and performance in situ, and examine how these effects are mediated by expertise. In Phase Three, we design and implement training interventions to improve perceptual-motor and cognitive performance. We test if a training protocol designed to optimise QE behaviour will (i) enhance effects of QE behaviour on filtering-out distraction as well as on firing behaviour, and (ii) changes the brain mechanisms involved in implementing QE effects. This innovative approach using breakthrough technical advancements will have significant implications for neuroscience and sports science.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will have both a significant economic and social impact. First, the results of this translational research can be applied to various areas of society. For example, in Phase Two, we examine the effect of anxiety on performance in aiming tasks. This work has implications for aiming in other domains, such as law enforcement, and the military, where individuals are faced with high-anxiety situations. The knowledge gained in the current project can help understand how performance can be maintained under these highly stressful situations to enable successful outcomes and minimise error. Similarly, surgeons can also benefit from the application of our findings. For instance, during laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon has to aim and manipulate probes in order to carry out the operation. An increased understanding of how anxiety effects visual attention and performance would allow training interventions or strategic protocols to be developed to overcome the negative affects of this stressor. Not only would this increase performance levels and reduce error, it would make surgical procedures safer.

The most direct impact of the work will be in the sport of archery. As the project is supported by GB Archery and we will be utilising a sample of elite performers, the findings will have substantial impact on the sport. Specifically, we will be able to determine key behavioural characteristics that affect performance, and identify more efficient methods of training, not only elite, but sub-elite and grass roots archers. The expediting of skill acquisition will not only improve performance, keeping Britain at the top of the world stage, but also impact on coaching practice. The results of the study will be used to redesign the coaching methods used throughout the sport. The work will be disseminated to athletes, coaches and educators in the sport, as well as other similar aiming sports in the UK. The translational value of the results is likely to extend to a number of sports, which will provide opportunities to undertake further research.

The development of the training intervention and identification of more effective and efficiency training strategies will also benefit other areas of society. For example, in the education and learning sector, the results could have significant impact on processes and applied practice. The increase in knowledge and improvement in methods will significantly reduce the time, money and resources needed to develop the next generation of surgeons, soldiers, police officers and sports stars.

Alongside the practical and applied impact of the research there will also be major theoretical impacts. In particular, in the areas of neuroscience and sport science, the research is at the cutting-edge and will make substantial theoretical advancements. Specifically, identifying the neural activation during QE and how these structures differ between skill levels, and under high-anxiety scenarios, demonstrates a considerable step in understanding visual attention and performance. The findings derived from the work will be disseminated via national and international conferences, and high-impact peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters and professional publications, in both neuroscience and sport science specific outlets.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>230036</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GB Archery</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Gaze strategies and QE in expert performers</gtr:description><gtr:id>A27AFD7A-E0BF-491D-AC74-0FD84729FCBB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration has provided access to testing facilities and data collection, as well as recruitment of participants for the study and transfer of knowledge (gaze strategies).</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Equipment and facilities at Lilleshall, recruitment, knowledge transfer.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A collaboration with GB archery has resulted in the recruitment of participants and the assessment of gaze strategies to potentially improve performance in the elite archers.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Conference on Spatial Cognition (ICSC 2015) Quiet eye symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>243763A7-A68E-4AA2-B293-95A58D6D2E8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an invited talk as part of a special symposium dedicated to the Quiet eye.

We also provided feedback to participants that had already taken place in the study. We measured eye movements and performance in elite archers. As feedback, we established whether each elite athlete exhibited a correlation between the &amp;quot;quiet eye&amp;quot; (steady fixation) and their shooting score. We identified whether lower scores or errors could have been due to the individual making larger eye movements (not a steady fixation or quiet eye) from the aiming point. Potentially, this or these individuals would benefit from gaze training (as previously demonstrated).

After the talk, additional participants were recruited to the study since they had an active interest in the study. As well, the existing participants were also interested in their findings and the potential meaning of their results.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings will be used to investigate gaze strategies in both novice and expert archers. If indeed gaze is indicative of superior performance, then archers that show increased gaze variability will be able to benefit from this Quiet eye training (see Causer, Holmes and Williams, 2011). In addition, by measuring the quiet eye phenomenon using a different eye tracking technique, we have overcome some of the inherent limitations in the identification of such behaviour. Finally, our findings further suggest that the quiet eye can be measured in a laboratory setting and thus the underlying mechanisms of the quiet eye can now begin to be explored. 



Our present findings have confirmed skill-related Quiet Eye Duration (QED) differences in the sport of archery, as in other aiming sports. This means that longer fixations or QEDs are employed by expert archers and that this may result in superior performance. This means that the athletes tested can now focus on identifying these beneficial gaze strategies within their sport and also better focus training protocols to prolong QEDs in less expert individuals. 

We have also found that these gaze strategies extended to a simulated task, that replicated the QEDs demands required in the field. This finding suggests that simulations can also be implemented as a means to identify QED in an individual (ability to fixate for longer periods) and perhaps can also be implemented as a training strategy to prolong fixation and enhance attention when off-practice due to injury, for example.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F6A2F1CA-8E2F-401F-BAB9-C96DCBC10195</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main goal of this study was to identify the mechanisms underlying the quiet eye (QE) in expert performers. The QE is a gaze strategy implemented by experts in many aiming sports (e.g., shooting, darts, billiards, etc). It is defined as a steady fixation prior to a motor response (throw or trigger) that seems to be of longer duration in experts compared to novices and that corresponds to better performance. We attempted to look at this behaviour in the sport of archery and identify the links between brain and behaviour in elite archers.

For this study, we have tested 11 elite archers, 11 experienced archers, 13 novice archers and 23 non archers in a series of 4 experiments designed to 1) identify quiet eye (QE) gaze aiming strategies in elite vs. novice archers in the field; 2) replicate these results using a computer simulated task, while also implementing manipulations to find within subject QE differences; 3) compare these results with non archers (simulated task); and 4) implement this task to identify the neural networks associated with the QE period using fMRI techniques. 

Our results suggest that indeed, elite performers implement these QE gaze strategies both in the field and in the simulated task and that these strategies are likely facilitating performance in this group. We also found that the QE involves far more complex mechanisms than previously thought consisting of top-down as well as bottom-up attention control mechanisms. It was previously thought that early open-loop programming was involved in the QE; however, we have found that feedback, on-line mechanisms also play an important role. 
We were able to utilise our novel simulated task to investigate aiming strategies in experts and novices and provide insight into the control mechanisms that may facilitate performance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As mentioned, our findings suggest that task complexity influences gaze strategies in novices but that expert's prolonged QED may indeed show improved motor programming in this group. This suggests that the QED could be analysed in a laboratory setting in which other potential mechanism involving the QED could be explored. In addition, our findings also suggest that archers could also benefit from gaze training. In particular, gaze strategies, specifically the QED, has been shown to be affected by anxiety and distractors (Behan and Wilson, 2008). Thus, the next steps would be to implement these training schemes to aid learning and improve performance in this population or in aiming sports in general. 
QED training has also been implemented outside of sports, such as with surgeons. Identifying the mechanism involved in QED may shed light into the underpinnings surrounding motor learning.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>724CD009-2B1A-43BA-9190-8414E92A965F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CD151B7D-9033-43FB-A318-0E83CBF69DC5"><gtr:id>CD151B7D-9033-43FB-A318-0E83CBF69DC5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identifying the behavioral mechanisms of the quiet eye in skilled and less-skilled archers during aiming tasks</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e1bb57f63444300bcc1795e74f257809"><gtr:id>e1bb57f63444300bcc1795e74f257809</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gonzalez C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>08952779</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/58886E67-4C6D-472D-A797-507A17D98EDB"><gtr:id>58886E67-4C6D-472D-A797-507A17D98EDB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identifying the causal mechanisms of the quiet eye.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European journal of sport science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e1c477b0b0bc4b3d332104800b231acf"><gtr:id>e1c477b0b0bc4b3d332104800b231acf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gonzalez CC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1536-7290</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/J018880/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EFFEC6B1-6BC8-4C9D-9D77-02CEF5E4E301</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomedical neuroscience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
