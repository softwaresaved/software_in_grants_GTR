Preserving them in a proper state fundamentally affects the economy and quality of life. However, their surveillance and maintenance are cost and time intensive, and asphalt concrete still has to be replaced after 15 years of use. Applying induction heating into the road could make pavements last much longer by stimulating the asphalt`s property of self-healing. Experimental results have found that a crack can be fully induction-healed, for at least 5 times. The efficiency of self-healing, however, depends on the temperature of the material and the temperature should be concentrated in the cracks alone. Thus, the challenge of this research is to discover how to apply energy only locally into the cracks without dispersing energy into undesired spaces. With this purpose, experimental and mathematical models of asphalt concrete self-healing under induction heating will be developed.
This research will serve to understand the relationships between induction heating, the particles used to heat the mixture, the heat flow through asphalt concrete and its effect on asphalt self-healing. We will discover the type of particles, intensities and frequencies of induction heating which are more appropriate for healing, how to concentrate the heat in the damaged areas and the relationship between the amount of energy induced and the healing of asphalt concrete.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the short term, results of this project will make a major impact in the understanding of engineered systems for asphalt self-healing. 
In the medium term, results of this project will have a major impact in the way in which asphalt roads are built and maintained, as we are in the path of creating a pavement that can potentially survive 5 times longer, at a minimum extra cost. 
In the long term, results of this project will have a major impact in the pavement construction industry. Asphalt self-healing has the potential to become a disruptive technology in pavements maintenance. Results of this project will also have a major impact in society, as traffic jams due to maintenance works will almost disappear. Accidents due to the bad conditions of the road will also be reduced. Less fuel will be used by vehicles in the roads.
Major beneficiaries will be: policy makers and maintenance funders, including the Highways Agency, the Department for Transport and Local Government; the wider public, through safer roads, reduced travel times and lower costs. In addition, a completely new industrial market, pavement healing, may open.
Whilst the focus of this project is on asphaltic materials, the approach has other applications, such healing thermoplastic polymers or welding polymers. 
In addition, international industries will be targeted through presentation of research results at various international conferences. Moreover, results will be targeted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. These international publications are targeted to a public composed of industries and researchers. 
Furthermore, the Nottingham Asphalt Research Consortium (NARC) will provide access to a wide range of industrial organisations (such as Aggregate Industries, Bitumen Industries and Pavement Industries). The progresses of this research will be presented in the different research meetings that take place every year. 
Moreover, economic and industrial beneficiaries will be updated with the results through publication of research at specialized journals, such as the Pavior Magazine, or the New Civil Engineer Journal. Results will be presented at national events, such as the conference UK Transport, organized by the Institution of Civil Engineering (ICE), which will be held in London in 2015 or 2016, where a high number of industrial members will be present. 
Societal beneficiaries will be informed about asphalt self-healing through press notes into media, such as the Metro newspaper. The PI has done this before, in the newspapers Blick am Abend and 20 Minutes, in Switzerland, gaining a great attention by the public and by local industries. Additionally, research will be presented at the UCAS Open Days of the University. Poster and video displays will be created to highline the research and implications of the work to society. 
As, from the results generated in this project there may be particular applications of interest for the asphalt industry, the Business Development Manager of the Infrastructure and Geomatics Division at the UoN will keep a constant overview of the research, both during and after the project has finished, to assess if there is Intellectual Property that should be protected. 
The impact activities will be taken by the PI. The PI has experience working as a pavement engineer for more than 8 years and he has been researching asphalt self-healing for more than 5 years. He will use his international contacts to ensure a good dissemination of results. In addition, he works for the Nottingham Transportation Engineering Centre (NTEC), which is the main co-ordinator of the NARC consortium and has extensive industry and administration contacts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97162</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Kuopio</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Finland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with University of Bio Bio, Chile</gtr:description><gtr:id>1A7B1758-A4E8-4556-AC29-25472BE944C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An article, has been submitted in January 2016 to Materials and Design:

This was a very exciting coincidence, as there are many pavements already built that use steel slag as aggregates, and these pavements have been in the road for many years, which means they are already damaged. For this reason, in the next months we will be working together with Tarmac, a company, to characterise the heating of the existing pavements with steel slag and observe their damage recovery properties. Actualisation (03/02/2017): Tarmac Ltd has built a roundabout in Rutland.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3180C355-B476-4A86-9989-5B694404DED5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Construction,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have found that the asphalt self-healing obtained using induction differs from the natural healing that happens in nature. Asphalt self-healing happens due to the different heating rates, and thermal expansion coefficients of the bitumen used. These values do not depend on the source or type of bitumen. 

We have also found that asphalt mixture does not heal differently depending on the air voids content and their connectivity level. 

Moreover, we have compared infrared, induction, and microwave heating for improving asphalt self-healing. 

When we finish this project, we expect to have a much more clear understanding of the factors influencing asphalt self-healing. 

With this grant we have published 4 articles on asphalt self-healing. In addition, we have built an experimental set-up that is currently being used to develop pavements that can collect energy from the solar heating. These experiments have produced 3 extra publications. 

We have attended the ISAP 2016 Symposium, From Molecules to Innovative Pavements, USA, and to the 4th International CEW event on Functional Pavement Design, the Nethelands. We presented the research in Nantes, France, at a RILEM conference and got our article selected for publication. We have submitted an article to the EATA (European Asphalt Transport Association) 2017 conference, in Switzerland that has been accepted for presentation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have discovered that the main factor influencing self-healing is the thermal expansion of the different components in the mixture that promote the movement of bitumen through the cracks. We have found that the thermal expansion is constant for every type of bitumen and that asphalt mixture composition does not have an influence on asphalt self-healing by using induction heating. This is excellent because we have eliminated the need for optimising the road materials. We have found that the cost of the technology is higher than expected and in the future we will work to reduce it. 

We have used the project to explain asphalt self-healing. Now we know exactly where the technology can take us. We have used what we have learned to initiate a new research on asphalt self-healing using capsules. 

My citation level has multiplied by 3. Tarmac built a road using this technology. 

Moreover, we have organised research collaborations with the University of Bio Bio, in Chile, Elacig in Turkey and the Chongqing Jiaotong University, in China. We have exported the technology to these places. We submitted several proposals to continue this topic, although so far we were not successful being granted. 

The next step in the research is to reduce the price of the materials, by using recycled elements, such as steel slag and recycled asphalt mixture.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>37F1A4BC-3A99-4F74-B99E-C0BBEFBD1938</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AD574484-F262-43E7-8324-389B8E421D5F"><gtr:id>AD574484-F262-43E7-8324-389B8E421D5F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Self-healing of asphalt mixture by microwave and induction heating</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Materials &amp; Design</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/beae8fcd33bded64dd233883a29127f3"><gtr:id>beae8fcd33bded64dd233883a29127f3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Norambuena-Contreras J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D98DCA5D-0B5A-4AD0-86DF-EC0F50EA5EA8"><gtr:id>D98DCA5D-0B5A-4AD0-86DF-EC0F50EA5EA8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Study of the mechanical properties and self-healing ability of asphalt mixture containing calcium-alginate capsules</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Construction and Building Materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1b0a574042610e707b46dcd4ab9dcb51"><gtr:id>1b0a574042610e707b46dcd4ab9dcb51</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Micaelo R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3F910FB9-3A93-4F8C-94D8-79B678D61199"><gtr:id>3F910FB9-3A93-4F8C-94D8-79B678D61199</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effect of air voids content on asphalt self-healing via induction and infrared heating</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Construction and Building Materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3f287f67286aeb51bc2213d73a099e4f"><gtr:id>3f287f67286aeb51bc2213d73a099e4f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>G?mez-Meijide B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>09500618</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7969A168-7AAA-4BE4-9E68-BD55C76A523C"><gtr:id>7969A168-7AAA-4BE4-9E68-BD55C76A523C</gtr:id><gtr:title>A fast pothole repair method using asphalt tiles and induction heating</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Construction and Building Materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3d6c498d60accc1e8d0d5bb9e4c8920c"><gtr:id>3d6c498d60accc1e8d0d5bb9e4c8920c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Obaidi H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>09500618</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M014134/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
