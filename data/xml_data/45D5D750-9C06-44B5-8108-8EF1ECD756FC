In those who develop a Candida bloodstream infection, over 40% will die. These high death rates are due to poor diagnosis of infection, associated with delays in drug treatment, and limited drug choices. 
Mouse models of fungal bloodstream infection remain an important tool in increasing our understanding of how infections occur and are essential for testing new drugs and diagnostic tools. However, at present, to monitor disease in mice over time requires sampling of groups of mice at many time points. Because there are differences between individual animals, 3-6 mice per group may be sampled at each time point. The ability to visualize infection in living mice would significantly reduce the numbers of mice used, as the same animal group can be repeatedly assessed during the study. 
Attempts have been made to develop reporters for C. albicans previously, but none have successfully imaged bloodstream infections. Problems with interference from tissues have limited their use, as well problems getting substrates into fungal cells. Development of new fluorescent reporters, which use chemicals found naturally in mammals as substrates, suggest that these may be more suitable for imaging fungal infection.
The goal of this study is to modify an existing near-infrared reporter gene to allow it to be expressed in C. albicans cells. A whole range of different fungal strains will be created where the reporter gene expression is controlled by different promoters. These strains will be analysed in the laboratory to identify the strain which is most suitable for use in the mouse infection model. In the final part of the project the reporter will be tested in a small number of mice to confirm its suitability for imaging in live animals.
This project has the potential to massively reduce animal usage in fungal research where infection is monitored over time. Analyses of our own previous studies and those published by other research groups suggest that development of the new reporter for C. albicans could reduce the numbers of mice used in experiments by 75-90%.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Candida bloodstream infections remain a significant problem in severely ill patients, particularly those in intensive care units and surgical patients. Mortality rates remain high due to difficulties in diagnosis, delays in initiation of antifungal therapy and limited choices of antifungal drugs. 

Animal models of Candida bloodstream infection remain a vital element in the development of new antifungal agents and diagnostic tests, as well as increasing our understanding of how infection initiates and progresses. However, in temporal studies there is potential for large numbers of animals to be used. Because of inherent biological variation, groups of 3-10 animals are sampled at the each time point, with analyses based upon the mean or median values for each group. In vivo imaging of fungi in a single group of animals over the same time period would significantly (75-90%) reduce the number of animals required for the same study. However, in vivo imaging of invasive fungal infection requires a reporter which can be detected in the internal organs of mice. To date, none of the reporters developed for C. albicans has been able to accurately reflect disease progression. 

Publication of new near-infrared reporters for mammalian cells has demonstrated that the near-infrared fluorescence can be detected deep within mice. In addition, only an endogenous compound, biliverdin, is required for fluorescence. 

The aim of this project is to develop a codon-optimized near-infrared reporter (iRFP) for use in in vivo imaging of C. albicans. A range of constructs will be produced, with the Candida optimized reporter (camiRFP) expression controlled by various Candida gene promoters. Strains expressing the various strains will be extensively analysed in laboratory tests to identify the most suitable reporter for in vivo imaging. Finally, the Candida reporter gene will be validated in small scale experimental infection studies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76139</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/K000306/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
