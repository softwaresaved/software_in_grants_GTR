Directly, they produce volatile small lipophilic molecules (SLMs) that are antagonistic to pests, and indirectly, they release SLMs as stress signals to attract pest natural enemies. Furthermore, neighbouring plants have evolved to respond to the stress signalling by induction or augmentation (priming) of their defence response. The ability to elicit or prime crop plants for defence upon detection of plant stress signalling provides an opportunity to develop new mixed cropping systems, whereby the identified stress signals associated with initial pest attack on sentinel (guard) crops can be used for the activation of defence in main crops. The overall aim of this project is to bring together UK and Brazilian partners to develop resilience in maize against fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, in smallholder farms in Brazil. This will be based upon the chemical ecology of maize/S. frugiperda interactions, for the deployment of a mixed cropping system that exploits plant/plant signalling from initially attacked plants for conservation (natural enemy) biocontrol in main crops. Different cultivars and landraces of maize will be evaluated to characterise the emission of S. frugiperda-induced stress signalling. Plants will be either unchallenged or challenged with S. frugiperda and headspace extracts containing the induced stress signals will be obtained by air entrainment. The stress signals will be analysed using GC-FID and identified using GC-MS. To confirm the biological activity of the identified stress signals, bioassays will be conducted to evaluate their influence on the foraging behaviour of pest natural enemies. To evaluate stress signal induction of defence in neighbouring maize cultivars and landraces, undamaged neighbouring maize plants (recipients) will be exposed to the stress signals released by S. frugiperda-damaged plants (donors). The induced signalling will then be collected from recipient plants and identified by GC-FID and GC-MS to see if the donor stress signalling has elicited a defence response in recipients. To confirm the biological activity of the stress signals released by recipients, bioassays will be conducted to evaluate their influence on the foraging behaviour of natural enemies. To evaluate differential expression of stress signal biosynthesis genes between stress-signal exposed and unexposed recipient plants, messenger RNA will be extracted from signal-exposed and unexposed recipient maize cultivars and landraces and subjected to Next Generation Sequencing transcriptome analysis. The differential expression of putative biosynthesis genes that specifically encode enzymes involved in stress signal biosynthesis will be confirmed using real time PCR analysis. These genes will be identified as targets for selection of maize cultivars and landraces with resilience to S. frugiperda, in which gene expression can be elicited by exposure to the stress signals identified. Field studies will be carried out on experimental-based plots at Embrapa Maize and Sorghum in Minas Gerais. Plots will be organised with mixed cropping of the maize cultivars and landraces that are shown to be either highly susceptible to fall armyworm damage and emit plant stress signalling (sentinel crops), or respond to stress signalling though elicitation of their own defence (main crops). After completion of the field experiment, farmers and extension officers known to Embrapa will be taken though Farmers Field Schools/Farmers Field Forum training where they will be educated on the mixed cropping strategy for maize protection. Once the mixed cropping system strategy for control of fall armyworm is developed and successfully demonstrated in farmer field schools/forums, it will be documented in simple language in factsheets and illustrated handbooks.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Different cultivars and landraces of maize (L-MIRT-2A, Sint&amp;eacute;tico Spodoptera, HS-MIRT-4, Zapalote Chico and L3, from Embrapa Germplasm Bank) will be evaluated to characterise the emission of S. frugiperda-induced signalling.

Using dynamic headspace collection, high resolution gas chromatography (GC-FID), GC coupled-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC peak enhancement with authentic samples of compounds prepared by chemical synthesis, we demonstrated that challenge of Brazilian maize cultivars with larvae of S. frugiperda elicits cultivar-dependent production of volatile secondary metabolites that cause adult S. frugiperda repulsion and recruitment of a natural enemy parasitoid (parasitic wasp). We showed that production of the volatile metabolites in unchallenged maize can be primed by airborne stress signalling originating from neighbouring S.frugiperda-damaged maize. We successfully tested our hypothesis that S. frugiperda damage causes a cultivar-dependent increase in production of benzoxazinoids (BXs). Collection and analysis of BXs was facilitated by a one month visit by an Embrapa-Genetic Resources and Biotechnology scientist to Rothamsted Research, with skills being transferred to the Embrapa scientist for further development of the project in Brazil. We conducted preliminary field studies with selected maize cultivars on experimental plots at Embrapa-Genetic Resources and Biotechnology, and showed that there is statistically significant reduction in S. frugiperda populations.

Our hypothesis that production of the volatile metabolites in S. frugiperda-damaged and primed maize is via CYP450-mediated oxidative stress was tested using next generation sequencing (comparative RNA-seq) to show differential expression of putative CYP450 genes upon either S. frugiperda challenge or exposure to airborne stress signalling. Collection of RNA for sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the transcriptome data was facilitated by a three month visit by an Embrapa-Genetic Resources and Biotechnology scientist to Rothamsted Research, with skills being transferred to the Embrapa scientist for further development of the project in Brazil. 

The challenge will be to understand the underlying mechanism of the plant signalling process at the chemical and genetic level, including identification of the new airborne elicitor(s) and confirmation of the role of CYP450 genes in metabolite production. This work will underpin the challenge of selecting and developing maize cultivars for use as sentinel plants (detecting and responding to the pest problem) and smart main plants (selected to respond to the sentinel plant volatile signalling) in Brazilian smallholder maize production.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Globally, sustainable intensification of crop production systems requires the delivery of new crop protection tools via seed, ie. GM, and the enhancement of ecosystem services, i.e. beneficial natural enemies, from land set aside as natural habitats. The findings here underpin the practical development of new crop protection interventions based on chemical ecology, specifically plant defence signalling, and which can deliver crop protection via smart plants, sentinel technology and recruitment of ecosystem services i.e. beneficial natural enemy populations for conservation biological control.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7FB0B2BF-9D9A-40FF-BB3D-655B4A052546</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M029204/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C640FECC-44CA-4B72-8D37-BE5E5DC0324C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interaction with organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
