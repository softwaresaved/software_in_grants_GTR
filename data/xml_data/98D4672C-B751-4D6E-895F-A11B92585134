This process of distinguishing self from other (self-other distinction) is important, for example, when sharing the affective state of another person- where emotions of the other influence those of the self (e.g. your sadness makes me feel sad) - but also when responding to the person in distress, where mental representations of self and other must be kept separate (e.g. it is you who is in pain, not me; therefore I will try to comfort you). If the ability to distinguish self from other is impaired, this can result in personal distress, which in turn can hinder the ability to respond empathically to the person in need. 

The experiments in this proposal seek to gain a better understanding of the processes involved in self-other distinction within social interaction and will employ a range of behavioural and social neuroscience methods in three convergent streams of research. The first one will assess the empathic abilities of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and mirror-touch synaesthesia (MTS; individuals who experience touch on their own bodies when observing another being touched), in the context of both sharing the emotional state of others and providing an appropriate empathic response to the person in need. The results from these studies will provide a better understanding of the level of social impairment in both ASD and MTS and could potentially provide empirical support to the view that individuals with autism do not lack empathy per se, but that instead, impaired self-other distinction might prevent them from responding empathically to others. Furthermore, these findings could also shed light on how self-other processes typically operate. The second stream will use non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance self-other processing in both atypical groups (MTS and ASD) and in healthy individuals. Finally, the third stream will combine the same brain stimulation technique with neuroimaging in order to gain a better understanding of how brain stimulation affects the connectivity patterns between different brain regions involved in self-other processing. The findings from Streams 2 and 3 will provide a better insight into the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms supporting a range of social abilities including empathising with others, imitating another's action, controlling the tendency to imitate others and distinguishing between our own face and that of another person. 

This proposal affords a unique opportunity to understanding key processes underlying our ability to interact with others. Although most of us take this ability for granted, little is known about how precisely this happens. Furthermore, for individuals with known social impairments such as those with ASD, difficulties in controlling self-other representations in different social contexts can have severe impacts in their personal, family and professional lives. Therefore, the questions addressed by these experiments are important for both advancing scientific theories of social interaction and for devising future therapeutic interventions in clinical populations where self-other processes have broken down.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
Beyond academia, the proposed project will have an impact on clinical practitioners, individuals with autism, their families, support workers, teachers, individuals with mirror-touch synaesthesia and members of the general public interested in autism and/or synaesthesia. 

How will they benefit from this research? 

1)Clinical practitioners 
The studies in Streams 1 and 2 will benefit clinical practitioners by providing theoretical insights that will contribute towards a better understanding of ASD. But the most relevant impact of this research is the potential to aid future therapeutic interventions aimed at individuals with conditions where mechanisms supporting social ability breakdown, including autism, schizophrenia, psychopathy/ antisocial personality disorders and borderline personality disorders. For example, future interventions could include behavioural training and/ or tDCS protocols aimed at enhancing empathic abilities. 

2)Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), their families, support workers, teachers and the general public
Individuals with ASD are known to show impaired social ability, which can impact on their quality of life, deprive them from social support and reduce employment opportunities. However, the extent to which some of these social abilities are impaired or remain intact is still unknown. For example, it is often thought that autism is associated with lack of empathy. The study in Stream 1 could challenge this view by demonstrating that individuals with ASD are able to share the emotional state of others but due to impaired self-other processing; they are unable to respond empathically to the person in need. Furthermore, the brain stimulation studies could inform future therapeutic interventions as described above. Therefore, the findings from the proposed research could contribute towards a better understanding of autism by those with the condition, their relatives, health practitioners, teachers and the public in general. 

3)Individuals with mirror-touch synaesthesia (MTS) and members of the public interested in synaesthesia
Individuals with MTS are atypical because they experience the feeling of touch on their own body when observing another being touched, suggesting a blurring of the boundary between self and others. Unlike autism, MTS is not considered a clinical condition. There is an overall lack of awareness of this type of synaesthesia, even among those with MTS: anecdotal evidence suggests they believe that everyone else shares their synaesthetic experience. Research in this area is less than a decade old. Therefore, the findings from the MTS studies will contribute to raising awareness of MTS and will provide a better characterisation of this atypical experience. This in turn, will benefit individuals with MTS, MTS researchers and members of the general public interested in or curious about synaesthesia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>281626</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar talk - Behavioural &amp; Clinical Neuroscience Institute (Cambridge)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2AD2E143-C24A-45EF-A415-1EA699F583DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk was part of an on-going Seminar Series at the Behavioural &amp;amp; Clinical Neuroscience Institute (University of Cambridge) which provides an opportunity to introduce early career researchers in the Department and knowledge exchange across various areas of research.
