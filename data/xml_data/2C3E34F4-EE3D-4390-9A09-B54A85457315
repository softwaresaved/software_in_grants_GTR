An English translation of the Harivamsha has been a desideratum for decades, and will be of great value in many fields of Indology.\n\nThe Harivamsha is a text in Sanskrit from the early centuries CE, closely linked to the Mahabharata. It has 118 chapters in three sections: the Harivamshaparvan (about the line of Hari, i.e. Krishna), the Vishnuparvan (about Vishnu, i.e. Krishna), and the Bhavishyatparvan (about the future). The Vishnuparvan tells of Krishna in his own family context -- his home affairs; his foreign affairs being treated in the Mahabharata, most famously in the Bhagavadgita. As Krishna is one of the most celebrated figures in all of human culture, an English-language paperback Harivamsha will have appreciable effects in many dimensions of UK culture.\n\nThis project will translate, from Sanskrit into English, the Harivamsha as reconstituted in 6073 verses by P.L. Vaidya after he undertook a detailed survey of 37 selected manuscripts ('The Harivamsha, being the khila or supplement to the Mahabharata, for the first time critically edited', vol. 1, Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1969). The method that Vaidya used to reconstitute the text is used in Sanskrit studies and more widely in textual studies with considerable success; it yields a reconstituted text that is often seen as the ancestor of all manuscript versions. The reconstituted Harivamsha is very different from the manuscript versions, but since it remains untranslated, the benefits of Vaidya's work have yet to penetrate fully into teaching and research. \n\nSome scholars have doubted the applicability of the text-critical method to certain old Sanskrit texts. This project will thus probe the suitability of applying that method to the Harivamsha, and clarify the status of the resulting text. \n\nThe project will also re-evaluate the relationship between the Harivamsha and certain other old Indian texts, especially the Mahabharata. If the reconstituted Harivamsha is viewed as an ancient text, its production in the early centuries CE has implications for our understanding of its original context and purpose. The reconstituted Mahabharata claims the Harivamsha as a part; but was it always an integral part, or was it incorporated only latterly, and if so, why? Study of the reconstituted Harivamsha will have important effects within Mahabharata studies -- which up to now have often overlooked it -- and more widely in Indology.\n\nThe project will result in a compact paperback English translation of the Harivamsha in the 'Oxford World's Classics' series, with a short introduction contextualising the text and encouraging the reader to approach it as a story of universal human interest. The project team will use the book launch for this publication as a knowledge transfer event promoting wider interest in Sanskrit narrative literature; the launch will feature four short talks by leading figures -- academics and non-academics -- on aspects of the Krishna tradition. Readings from the new translation will also be featured at an international storytelling festival in 2014.\n\nThe research team's wider findings will be explored in a series of five seminars held in Cardiff during the three-year project, discussed in two UK and one international conference papers, and published in two refereed articles -- one aimed at scholars of many languages other than Sanskrit, and one written for a specialised Indological audience. \n\nThus although focusing primarily upon a single text, the project will utilise several different research methods and its outputs will serve several different audiences, some within academia, some without. It represents a fruitful, innovative, and timely combination of philological scholarship on textual and translation issues, and more searching literary and contextual interpretation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Many groups in the UK have an existing interest in Krishna, such as Hindu communities of Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi, or Tamil origin, and those involved in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Due in part to the missionary activities of the latter in recent times, awareness of an ancient Indian god-man called Krishna is also widespread in the general population. This being the case, a project focused on Krishna can have considerable public impact.\n\nThis project's impact will be multifaceted and multicultural. In many aspects it will be hard to measure, since it will be in the form of intellectual capital and life enrichment for various discrete individuals; but there will also be visible impact in and through various arts media. The new mass-market Harivamsha translation will bring the oldest version of Krishna's story to the general reading public; and it is likely to prompt spin-off effects such as audiobooks, plays, radio plays, films, exhibitions, and other performance initiatives focusing on Krishna's story. Such initiatives will impact upon audiences in the same ways as the translation -- that is, by entertaining, edifying, and inspiring them -- and will also be economically beneficial within the entertainment and infotainment industries.\n\nThe historical connection between the UK and India is very strong, but is also of a particular type; and the dangers of cultural negligence are thus particularly keen here. Consider the imbalance in the relationship of UK high culture to classical Greece and Rome on the one hand, and to classical India on the other. It is important in global terms for translation efforts to be concentrated in fields where there remain the most, and the most significant, untranslated texts. That Sanskrit is such a field seems to fit the colonial history; and thus this project's printed outputs should be seen not just in terms of an impact package peculiar to the project, but also in terms of responsibly managing the ongoing impact of British foreign policy in the last several hundred years.\n\nThe new Harivamsha translation will broaden and deepen our hitherto rather retarded public engagement with the classics of Sanskrit literature. Such engagement will enhance the public's ability to engage sensitively with a changing globalised world increasingly led, in economic terms, by the eastern nations. The present UK government has made the development of cultural relations with India a strategic priority, and the proposed project will thus be part of a wider national project that will benefit the UK economy in many ways.\n\nThe new translation will facilitate good citizenship and community cohesion locally, nationally, and internationally, not just because of what it represents as a shared cultural object, but also because of its literary brilliance and specific narrative contents -- for the Harivamsha is, in many ways, a treatise on contextually and historically informed responsibility, particularly with regard to groups with which one has an ongoing relationship, but differing vested interests.\n\nAs detailed on the 'Pathways to Impact' document, impact will be managed using web pages, a publicity leaflet, and several impact events. A book launch will attract a wide cross-section of society and thus reflect the breadth of the Harivamsha's appeal; and there will also be an impact event oriented around the narrative form of the Harivamsha and its appeal to storytellers and their audiences.\n\nIn sum, the impact of this project will be subtle, deep, and long-lasting. The principal output will reach a large audience and will furnish its readers with a new resource for relating to the world's human past, the commonalities between human experiences across time, space, and culture, and the specificities of their own selves and contexts.
