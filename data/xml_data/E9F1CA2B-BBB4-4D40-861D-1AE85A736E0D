This makes scientific findings from the zebrafish translatable for medical research. Adult and larval fish are being used in diverse fields, including research in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases and undergo potentially painful procedures, yet most procedures are done without proper analgesia (pain relief). This is mainly because not much is known about how fish process potentially harmful input. Efforts are underway to look, for example, at changes in behaviour after potentially painful experiences and how specific drugs (analgesics) mitigate these, in order to develop protocols for effective analgesia (pain relief) in fish. However, the central nervous system, which receives these stimuli, processes them and directs the behavioural changes, is not being analysed. We believe that analysing changes in the central nervous system is indispensable to directly demonstrate that harmful stimuli affect the brain, and that analgesic drugs are effective at the level of brain. In this pilot project, we aim to support efforts analysing behaviour and other parameters by finding changes in the activity of different genes in areas of the spinal cord and brain after potentially painful experiences. This will give direct information on the processing of such input. Moreover, by trying a number of potential analgesics we will determine which of these work most effectively by directly measuring gene activity in the brain. Our preliminary analyses show that application of mustard oil to muscle tissue leads to increased activity of genes in the spinal cord and brainstem that are often activated in the context of harmful stimuli. Ideally, we will find analgesics that block this reaction already at the level of the spinal cord, where stimuli are first processed. In subsequent research, our findings from the brain will be compared to data from behaviour and other non-invasive measures to determine optimal protocols for analgesia in fishes and derive non-invasive indicators of successful analgesia in future zebrafish research. Our data will thus help to refine experiments in fishes in the sense of Refinement as defined in the 3Rs, by devising protocols for analgesia that are supported by neurobiological observations and thus inform scientists and policy makers on best practice in fish experiments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The zebrafish is increasingly being used in biomedical research, because it is a cost-effective vertebrate model organism. However, most of the more than 400.000 procedures per year are performed without analgesia, because there is a lack of knowledge regarding nociception and effective analgesics in this important laboratory species. Efforts are underway to establish non-invasive measures of nociception, such as altered behaviour and cortisol measurements. To firmly link such measures to nociception, changes in genes expression elicited by noxious stimuli in the CNS need to be established. In this pilot project, we propose to analyse gene expression changes of immediate early genes and endogenous opiates in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where primary nociception processing takes place, and in higher brain centres. Our preliminary findings indicate that c-fos expression is selectively increased in the dorsal horn and pro-enkephalin expression is increased in the brainstem of adult fish that received an intramuscular injection of mustard oil, compared to those that received a vehicle injection. This suggests that gene expression changes specifically related to nociception and not just to handling stress can be measured. We will conduct similar experiments in larval zebrafish and, importantly, will determine how potential analgesics reduce nociception-related gene expression. Our experiments will elucidate central nociception in zebrafish and will inform other studies using non-invasive measurements regarding the relevance of these measures to nociception. Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the refinement of procedures conducted on zebrafish by devising effective ways of analgesia and validating non-invasive measurements of these.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73769</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/L000237/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
