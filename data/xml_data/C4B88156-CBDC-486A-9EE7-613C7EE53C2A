For many years motherhood was the most popular area of family studies and gender-inflected literary criticism and history. Although studies of fatherhood have increased in the last ten years, they have mainly come from social historians (such as John Tosh), or have focused on the treatment of fatherhood by novelists (Catherine Waters and Dianne Sadoff have both written about fatherhood in Dickens). Where fatherhood has been the central focus, it has often privileged the child's viewpoint (for example through memoirs of Victorian fathers) seeing the father very much as a problematic 'Other', and perpetuating the famous stereotyped image of the dominant and unsympathetic Victorian father. Although recent studies have begun to query and erode this sterotype, one aim of this project is to dismantle this cliche and replace it with a much more complex and finely nuanced picture of Victorian fatherhood in the educated middle class: the group who most extensively documented it. Essentially, this is done by focusing on the fathers themselves as commentators on their own role. As the Victorians theorised fatherhood in a much more limited fashion than they did motherhood, it was by no means obvious what a father was expected to do other than provide for his family and protect them. The father's role within the home, especially, was unclear. My project therefore concentrates on the subjective view of fatherhood in the nineteenth century, articulated by fathers themselves, especially in terms of how they managed their responsibilities, and in effect customised a role for themselves. \n\nThis invention of a role was especially problematic and necessary during the mid-nineteenth century when fathers were being gradually deprived of certain automatic rights they had at the beginning - most notably rights of custody to any children in the event of marital separation. They were increasingly blamed for family unhappiness, lampooned or satirised in fiction and journalism, and attacked in the spate of memoirs which emerged at the end of the Victorian period (for example in Butler's The Way of all Flesh, 1903, and Gosse's Father and Son, 1907, besides the many critical appraisals of Archbishop Edward White Benson by his sons Arthur Christopher and Edward Frederic). This book aims to use a wide range of materials, both literary and historical, drawing on unpublished memoirs and letters as well as periodical articles, novels and autobiographies, some of which (for example Macready's diaries) have not previously been used extensively in this kind of study. Discussion will be structured around comparative case histories of fathers: for example Dr Arnold of Rugby and his son Matthew; Dickens and Macready, as 'theatrical' fathers; the scientists Darwin, Huxley and Hooker; and Gladstone and his Archbishop of Canterbury Edward White Benson. An opening chapter on the failure of fatherhood reviews the cases of Prince Albert, Dean Tait of Carlisle (whose five daughters died in a single outbreak of scarlet fever), the poet Thomas Hood, and George Eliot's partner, George Henry Lewes. As many of the fathers I discuss knew each other and at moments of crisis depended on one another's support, a growing sense of dialogue and debate about fatherhood, its duties, responsibilities and emotional urgency emerges. The 'tragi-comedy' of the title refers to the often undignified and powerless position in which Victorian fathers found themselves, as their initial delight in their young children was compromised by financial pressures, the ravages of illness, the difficulties of managing lethargic teenagers, and their overall failure to protect or provide for them as they had intended. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-04-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19361</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F005156/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
