Representations of women professionals and leaders are however under increasing scrutiny. A continued media focus on women's gender, not competence, ignores women's achievements as leaders and professionals, misrepresenting their ability, contribution and advancement e.g. the focus on women political leaders' appearance, children, partners and not on social policy. These misrepresentations undermine gender equality and social justice and perpetuate women professionals and leaders as 'out of place,' constraining their progress. Challenges to gendered media misrepresentations of women are reflected in an increasingly powerful discourse of resistance by governmental groups, lobbyists, media organisations and feminist societies. Yet to date there is limited management and business (M&amp;amp;B) studies research into gendered media misrepresentations of women professionals and leaders. Further, a contradiction exists between UK and European governmental and societal debates on gender inequalities, quotas and initiatives to increase women professionals and leaders (e.g. Lord Davies Report 2010; Horizon 2020) and the continued gendered media misrepresentations of women. Interrogating gendered media representations is essential to gain fresh insight into contemporary debates of social justice and instrumentally bringing about social and economic change. Researchers have begun to consider the negative implications of gendered media misrepresentations of women yet there is a lack of established and rigorous research protocols in the field; the research remains marginalised and researchers are isolated from the M&amp;amp;B 'mainstream.' In contrast, research into gendered media representations has a long history in gender, journalism, media, communications and cultural studies but approaches have not fully engaged in the implications for women professionals and leaders. The Seminar Series is a timely and innovative opportunity for M&amp;amp;B researchers to connect with scholars from other disciplines, media producers, editors and journalists; key audience groups (professionals, leaders, unions, networks representing young women); lobbyists and policy makers through a multidisciplinary knowledge exchange.
This groundbreaking Series will develop an international multidisciplinary network by bringing together a core group of scholars with diverse media stakeholders, lobbyists and policy makers. This will lead to a unique network and focal point for academics at varying career stages to engage across disciplines with diverse stakeholders for topical research into, and provide challenge to, gendered media misrepresentations of women professionals and leaders.The Series will develop: innovative theoretical, methodological and conceptual frameworks; M&amp;amp;B research capacity, curricula and research priorities and through instrumental dissemination will raise awareness and influence global challenge and change.
The Series reflects the global nature of the research issue. Keynote speakers and participants will be UK and international scholars and key stakeholders who will each bring expertise from regional, national and international levels. The Series will develop sustainable collaborative networks and research publications in M&amp;amp;B studies and maximise impact. The Seminar Series has 3 themes: 1. 'Gendered Media Misrepresentations: Why do they matter and how do we know?' 2. 'Developing Research Capacity for B&amp;amp;M Studies: Multidisciplinary methodologies, theories and concepts/analysing media texts and visual methods; and 3. 'Developing Priority Research Agendas and Maximising Impact'. 8 of the 1 day Seminars will focus on distinct but inter-related aspects of the Series' focus. The final Seminar will be a 1-day conference to consolidate knowledge exchange and research priorities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This first Seminar Series on gendered media misrepresentations of women professionals and leaders will create an international multidisciplinary network, supported by 'on demand' webcasts of seminars for knowledge exchange, and new research collaborations across a breadth of stakeholders. Significant collaborations between academics and diverse media stakeholders have been created, with potential for impact across disciplines and practice. Established, early career academics and postgraduate students from M&amp;amp;B, gender, journalism, media, communications, cultural studies will benefit from a unique collaboration of academics and media stakeholders: producers, editors and journalists; key audience groups (professionals, leaders, unions and networks representing young women), lobbyists and policy makers. This will develop research capacity, new knowledge and academic/practice outputs. The Series will develop M&amp;amp;B studies academics beyond those already engaged in media analysis research by providing opportunities to collaborate in developing research priorities and innovative theoretical and methodological approaches. The involvement of diverse media stakeholders will facilitate disruptive innovation; provide access for influencing policies and practice and opportunities to widen networks, facilitating the exchange of academic thinking and practice considerations to challenge gendered media representations. 
Outputs will be disseminated via: an edited book (with The International Leadership Association and Information Age Publishing Inc.). A Special Issue in Gender in Management: An International Journal, has been agreed with editors. Academic outputs will be submitted to journals e.g. Organization, British Journal of Management, Gender Work and Organization, Leadership Quarterly. Webcasts and the website will communicate information to a wide audience, facilitating global collaboration and networks. Research collaborations with international multidisciplinary and media stakeholders will produce sustained impact via capacity building, stakeholder organisation websites, reports and publications, contributions to debates on broadcast, print and social media and press releases for mainstream media and specialised professional publications e.g. The Gender Report on-line.
Key audience groups and how they will benefit from the research include:
General public: raising awareness of gendered media misrepresentations of women professionals and leaders will lead to changes in stereotypical thinking, progress a 'normalisation' of women in these roles, thus impacting on the economy and society.
Women in society: following the principle 'If She Can't See It - She Can't Be It', the research will influence the nature of media representations of women professionals and leaders, raising women's aspirations in relation to holding these positions, particularly through the dissemination of research outcomes via participating media stakeholders.
Employers: in raising awareness of gendered media misrepresentations of women, leading to moves towards a 'normalisation' of women as leaders and professionals, there is potential impact in creating more diverse workforces through gender mainstreaming and more diverse talent management strategies.
Secondary, Tertiary and Higher Education: shaping curricula and raising awareness of gendered media representations of women professionals and leaders in M&amp;amp;B studies (e.g. The Girls' School Association/College Principal/Head Teachers have agreed involvement); this will lead to progress in the 'normalisation' of women in senior roles, promoting young women's aspirations.
Organisations, Policymakers, Lobbyists - working with high profile stakeholders, findings will shape future policy on gender equality in society, spotlight priority areas and identify future research agendas.
Media producers: raising awareness of gendered media representations will influence the positioning of women at work in the media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29958</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>House of Commons Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>80C83AF1-EACC-4AFB-8E0E-1189AA2921AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Throughout the seminar series we have been careful to invite speakers and participants that represent different stakeholder groups, including young women from two schools in the north east; media studies scholars; editors and journalists who work across different media. We have developed a strong relationship with the Women's Media Center, Washington, D.C. and disseminated our work to parliamentarians and journalists at a seminar held in the House of Commons on 15th November, chaired by Ruth Cadbury, MP. This event was attended by journalists, early career researchers, and media producers.

One outcome of the event is that we are currently working with the media producer to create a short, provocative film in collaboration with a school in the north east. Our intention is that the film will become a resource for secondary school teachers. 

We are also liaising with Ruth Cadbury's office to run an event for a school, or schools, in her constituency to raise awareness of the implications of media representations on young women and men's career aspirations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings from the seminar series have informed two reports published by the Government Equalities Office:

Our principal findings from the Seminar Series so far have been communicated through the publications emerging from the series, and through the presentation of our work at the House of Commons seminar on 15th November 2016. The House of Commons seminar exposed our findings to parliamentarians, and a wider selection of media producers, including newspaper journalists. 

We continue to work towards creating non-academic impact through the network we have developed that includes media producers and secondary schools. Through this network we are designing the production of a short film, in collaboration with a school in the north east, which we intend to be made available for secondary school teachers teaching visual literacies.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B9EA39D3-BD3D-4F66-886C-F698F6057CB4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Whilst the seminar series is not a vehicle for gathering data, nevertheless the publications that have emerged from the series so far, an edited book and a special issue of the journal 'Gender in Management' have revealed the need for continued and increasing scrutiny of relationships between the media in its multiple forms and women's leadership. Women professionals and leaders continue to be represented in stereotypical ways. The presentations and discussions during the seminars attest to the need to describe and make visible women's (mis)representations in the media, yet also draw attention to the importance of situating their (mis)representations in the broader social, economic, historical, cultural, and political context as a means to gain insight into their development and evolution.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We envisage our greatest contribution will be to continue to work with seminar series stakeholders, in particular the young women who have attended the seminars, to raise awareness regarding the influence of the media on their career aspirations. We are already on the way to achieving some of our longer term benefits; as evidenced by our collaboration with the International Leadership Association in the publication of an edited volume. Once this is published, we will build upon this to disseminate the books' findings to practitioner audiences in the education and business contexts. Organizations with which we will collaborate to do this are seminar series stakeholders including the Government Equalities Office, Board Apprentice, Women's Media Center, (Washington DC), The International Leadership Association and the Geena Davis Institute on Gender and Media.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A3E99CCB-3FCC-47DB-B3E5-3B523F6894C4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.dur.ac.uk/business/research/management/critical-studies/projects/misrepresentation/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B5EB629C-2111-478C-8D78-757B98A3CB2A"><gtr:id>B5EB629C-2111-478C-8D78-757B98A3CB2A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Women managers, leaders and the media gaze</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Gender in Management: An International Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/53ccccf9cb0fe665804e385518e09c44"><gtr:id>53ccccf9cb0fe665804e385518e09c44</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mavin S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>17542413</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M001792/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>81456F7A-F893-4FBA-A440-D2F26CE7CADB</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/M001792/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>29958.08</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-10-22</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-01-10</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>0E4BEB28-6AB5-4D56-91C5-844906A155C8</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/M001792/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>20230.85</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-01-11</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-10-10</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>39B8C78D-8933-4158-88D3-165B9F15A254</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Leadership</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
