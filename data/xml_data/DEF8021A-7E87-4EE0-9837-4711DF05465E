Future developments will climb the frequency spectrum to embrace millimetrewaves, where for example 60GHz offers short-range communication with Gigabit bandwidths. Microwave wireless communications will move from the largely social voice/text media to a wide range of monitoring applications via sensor networks, and patient health telemetry /monitoring /control via on-body and in-body sensors and actuators will be a major user of this technology. Indeed medical and healthcare application of microwaves for treatment and communication is rapidly becoming a major worldwide growth area. Electronic implants to aid patents on a permanent or temporary basis are also seeing major growth, with international companies investing massively in R&amp;amp;D. Coincident with this technology there has been a massive increase in healthcare provision in the UK combined with an associated revolution in how treatment is offered to the patient. The simplicity and utility of technologies such as UWB, Bluetooth, GSM and 3G with voice, data, and streaming video offers much to healthcare. In the field of imaging short pulse microwave UWB offers non-ionising screening technology for cancer detection, whilst Terahertz (THz) radiation has enormous potential for a broad range of applications from health care to security, with spectroscopic materials analysis and atmospheric sensing of special scientific importance. It has already proven to be a valuable tool for applications including chemical spectroscopy (to detect biohazards and label-free sensing of genetic sequences), security imaging, non-destructive testing, cutaneous imaging and wireless communication at data rates exceeding 10Gb/s. This grant aims to focus our antenna, on/body propagation and metamaterial expertise into these areas by deploying short to medium term PDRA effort on feasibility studies or proofs of concept, which, if successful, would lead to full proposals being submitted.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-08-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1015952</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant finished in August 2013 and has supported (via PDRA support) the following research topics:

Status: resulted in publication of Chemical Society Review, (2012) and Chemical Physics Letters, (2013). Postdoc now taken lectureship at Univ. Bolton (2013).

? TAICHI - Terahertz Applied to gaining Insight into Chemical Harmonic Interactions, PI= Dr Robert Donnan. Project seeks to introduce two THz measurement systems from the electrical engineering community to the bio-chemistry community, and aims to demonstrate that quasi-coherent phenomena lay themselves open to detection that offers compelling insight into long-standing questions and grand-challenges in catalytic chemistry and structural biology. ERC - Consolidation Grant Application. Status: submitted Feb 2013, not funded.

? Currently 3 PhD studentships received based on this work: (i) identifying THz markers for dynamically tracking protein conformation; (ii) exploring the possibility of EBG-engineering of a hot surface so that the spectral emissivity envelope is re-shaped to give enhanced THz radiance (and is transformed to be coherent); (iii) devising means to improve laser-to-THz generation efficiency from photo-conductive antennas.
