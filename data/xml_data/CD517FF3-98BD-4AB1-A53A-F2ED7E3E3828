(Stage 2 in Fellowship in Creative &amp;amp; Performing Arts originally entitled 'Chronicle 2010' now known as CollabDocs.)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I025638/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Colllaborative Docs (Stage 2) is the second stage of the CollabDocs research project (formerly known as 'Chronicle 2010'.) The overall project looks at how documentary practice can take advantage of the generation of web technologies known as 'Web 2.0'. CollabDocs is concerned in particular with participatory media and collaboration. The practice-based research examines how the 'vernacular videos' that get posted, for example on You Tube, might be combined to tell larger stories, and what role a producer might play in bringing themed participatory videos together to meaningful effect. \n\nIn Stage 2 the Fellow will produce two distinct web-based participatory documentaries. The first - Are you happy? (Phase 2) - looks at what happiness means today. The second - Four Wheels Good? - looks at our love/hate relationship to cars. Both projects will start with a call to action, and diverse members of the public will be invited to contribute video content. These contributions will be edited and highlights presented in websites designed so that the video is contrasted in an engaging way with related online content. The latter content will be drawn in through publically accessible feeds. Such content could include stills from the photo sharing site Flickr or traffic news from the BBC. These various sources will be combined to produce a new kind of documentary, where the meaning is not fixed in a linear form by the viewpoint of a single director, but reflects multiple perspectives, and shifts as new data enters the system. The creative challenge for the project will be to design the flow of elements and the web interface so that the viewer can enjoy a satisfying experience; which combines storytelling, interaction and easily digestible information. \n\nA DVD will be produced to reflect the fellowship observations, critical reflection and findings, and showcase the web productions. The Fellow will also pursue a programme of in-person events and activities throughout the three remaining years of the Fellowship, but in particular in the final year, through which she will share the fellowship work and findings with interested parties in academia and industry.\n\n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The era of You Tube has seen a dramatic increase in video making and sharing. With the prevalence of miniature, low-cost video cameras and video recording features in many mobile phones we are witnessing a dramatic increase in what Henry Jenkins has called 'vernacular video'. For the most part these recordings are isolated statements or unmediated reflections on everyday life. \n\nThe Collaborative Docs project (Stage 2) looks as how these video utterances might be brought together to constitute effective public speech. It looks at how to engage participants, what a documentary product might look like which brings participatory video together with relevant facts and figures, as well as how to produce an engaging viewer experience from collective content. If we think of documentary as a means to reflect on contemporary life with a historic relationship to the public sphere it is possible to say that the Collaborative Docs project looks at how to turn isolated video statements into documentary content. \n\nThe project thus has both cultural and social relevance. Given the wider growth of collaborative practices in society it constitutes a timely experiment in cultural form. In social terms it demonstrates how what Sonia Livingstone has called 'publics' might be able to speak in a collective way around issues of contemporary concern and thus has significant potential for citizenship and social inclusion. \n\nIt can be expected that the project will be of particular interest within public service media and the third sector. Dissemination work will therefore include presentations and events which share project knowledge and insights with both these sectors. \n\nAdditionally, while the project does not in itself create a new product it provides a proof of concept that can be built on in the technical development of a scaleable product. Dissemination will therefore also include demonstrations to relevant technology companies. \n\nAs well as general relevance the particular themes that have been selected will make contributions to important contemporary debates. \n\nWith UK Government proposals to fast-track the inclusion of well-being and happiness measures into the Annual Household Survey, it is timely to explore contemporary views of happiness by revisiting the question, 'Are You happy?' originally posed by the anthropological filmmaker Jean Rouch on the streets of Paris in 1960. The outcomes are likely to be of interest among researchers in the disciplines - sociology, economics, psychology - that feed into the emerging field of Happiness Studies. \n\nFour Wheels Good will constitute an intervention into discourse around travel behaviour and potentially contribute to an understanding of the complex behaviours which influence individual decisions around travel. As such it potentially contributes towards a public policy agenda to reduce car travel. \n\n \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32499</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Searching for Happiness is Stage 2 of The 'Are You Happy?' Project - the practice output of the Fellowship in Creative and Performing Arts. 
The Project is a multi-year, multi-facetted exploration of the intersection between documentary and networked culture. Fifty years after Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin launched their seminal 1961 documentary, 'Chronique d'un Et&amp;eacute;', at a new moment of technological change, Rose has gathered footage from filmmakers and film enthusiasts around the world who she invited to revisit or restage the vox pop sequences from that film. 

Launched in May 2013 - Searching for Happiness takes advantage of the latest generation of web technology (HTML5) to investigate the potential of live data for the &amp;quot;creative treatment of actuality&amp;quot; (John Grierson's 1926 definition of documentary). Selected video contributions are combined through montage with social media - Tweets, Flickr images - drawn in 'live'. In this version of the project, entitled 'Searching for Happiness', the use of social media provides live re-contextualisation of the video content, re-inscribing some of the social and cultural surround that is lost within the filming process. Based on search terms, the social media is contingent, specific and emergent, so that the user-experience of the documentary changes from person to person and moment to moment. In this respect 'Searching for Happiness' offers an enunciation of documentary as live experience and open text.

Grounded by its reference to a previous moment of innovation, The 'Are You Happy?' Project provides a framework that elucidates the mix of continuity and novelty at play in digital documentary. The reference to Rouch also evokes his view of documentary as a process of collaborative meaning-making, which provides a context for a critical focus on the co-creative aspects of this work and of wider trends in crowd-sourcing documentary content.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0F3E16F-A097-4BE6-A3F9-D6371367232C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Showing the project has stimulated substantial interest in the potential of live data as a component of documentary.

The presentation employed Ivan Ilich's concept of &amp;quot;convivial tools&amp;quot; as a framework for thinking about participatory and &amp;quot;user-generated&amp;quot; documentary content. The presentation drew on examples, of practice that I'd been part of - BBC's Video Nation (access TV), Capture Wales (digital storytelling), My Science Fiction Life (collaborative cultural history), and work in the emerging field of collaborative online documentary - The Message and Mapping Main Street.

 

The framework of &amp;quot;conviviality&amp;quot; highlights ethics and social value, and encourages connections to be identified with historical practices - Mass Observation, the &amp;quot;shared anthropology&amp;quot; of Jean Rouch - and with wider contemporary cultural practice - DIY culture, participatory art, and Craftivism.

I was invited to speak to MA Students in Paris - a joint initiative of the Sorbonne and UCLA.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://teachingdocumentary.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Now the Field is Open - Presentation to Intro Day of Sheffield DocFest Devise to Deliver mentoring scheme</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43AE6653-B7AB-4030-9337-B586D0029B4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Q &amp;amp; A

I have been and continue to be invited to speak, present and consult in a variety of KE and industry contexts in the UK and abroad. I have repeatedly been invited to talk within the BBC - streamed live to three locations at a BBC Connected Studio development lab in 2013 for instance. I have been an advisor at Sheffield DocFest's Meetmarket (2013) and on the AHRC funded REACT Future Documentary Sandbox (2013), and I was the first UK curator on the MIT OpenDoc Lab _docubase - a key resource for practitioners of emerging documentary. In 2014/2015 I was an advisor on MIT Open Documentary Lab's Macarthur Foundation funded research - Mapping the Intersection between Two Cultures - Interactive Documentary and Digital Journalism. Within the scope of that role I attended a one-day convening at MIT OpenDocLab on the convergence between documentary and journalism online - the only UK academic in attendance - offering insight and chairing a panel in a gathering with representatives from the New York Times, The Guardian, the BBC, The Sundance Institute. At the same time, as Co-Director of the i-Docs project, I co-convene the i-Docs Symposium, co-host the facebook group and oversee the website. i-Docs is the prime UK meeting point for scholars and practitioners of emerging documentary, and my input to these sites provides and supports KE. These engagements provide practitioners with access to my research in a context where documentary is undergoing transformation within its form, market, distribution and exhibition. Practitioners need to better understand that context and the opportunities that it provides. Feedback has consistently shown that my work provides a valuable insight as they grapple with those changes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>971E3E01-955C-42C1-A018-A17779E4B217</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. My central research insight concerns the disruption to documentary which has come about in the context of digital. The impact is not only expressed at the level of form. Computerisation and the social, semantic and open web are between them producing an environment in which documentary tools, technology, funding, form, process, authorship and distribution are all reworked, and the audience become actors - capturing, liking, sharing, and potentially producing content. Documentary is transformed within a new media ecology. 

2. Lev Manovich and Henry Jenkins have both observed the tendency within digital culture for marginal twentieth-century cultural forms to be reinvented. My second key insight concerns the contemporary re-emergence and transformation of forms of community media and participatory art. Building (at times explicitly) on 20th century precedents in participatory art, community and access video, documentarists are seeking approaches to making purposeful digital work with people rather than about them. They adopt a range of modes - acting as facilitators, curators, collaborators. They experiment with architectures of participation, seeking ethical and aesthetic strategies; ways to be true to participants and engage an audience, to create the conditions within which a necessary story can be told, in a context of meaningful dialogue. 

3. In this new environment the role of the director/producer is often becoming a practice of co-creativity. I have explored this role in the growing repository of interviews with key practitioners published on the CollabDocs blog. One feature of this environment is an emphasis on process and face-to-face interaction with interactive media providing a stage for a public conversation. A co-creative approach to documentary provides a progressive re-working of documentary's historic role in the public sphere, as an open space for dialogue and a stage for the performance of citizenship. 

4. The fourth research finding concerns the potential for documentary within the 'ubiquitous data' that is both consequence and driver of the online environment. In particular I have noted the morphing of the character of video in the context of the latest web coding language, HTML5. Before that coding language became common web video was impervious to its life online; published online in a way that reproduced the conditions of the TV screen. Now, existing databases and live information drawn from social media can be connected to the documentary environment, offering opportunities for the production of new kinds of knowledge and application. 

The affordances of networked connectivity offer the potential to re-contextualise documentary material through mobilising the enormous co-creative potential of human discourse captured in the web. This has been a central theme of my web documentary, &amp;quot;Searching for Happiness&amp;quot;. That documentary has sought to find a form to shape live content into a coherent experience. The project points the way to the re-invention of documentary for the online environment and the creation of new visual and informational grammars.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The invitations that I continue to receive to speak, present, and participate in a variety of convenings both in the UK and internationally attest to the substantial interest that there is in the insights I have developed within the framework of the CollabDocs AHRC Research Fellowship within creative economy and pedagogical contexts. Documentary is in a process of transformation as described above as well as hybridisation with other genres. The intersection between journalism and documentary online is of particular note. Research is required to map these new landscapes and consider the reframing of both cultures. One might ask: how does the reader / user comprehend content where Journalisms's strict codes around impartiality and consent meet the looser, more creative framework of documentary? 

There is much interest among practitioners also in the community media and Access TV precedents of 21st century participatory documentary. Further work could address specific case studies and develop resources to equip documentarians with models and protocols so that they can to think about how to work effectively and ethically with non-professionals. This builds on the production experience of global collaboration within The are you happy? Project. 

Additionally there is significant interest among practitioners in the use of live data within documentary - a central exploration within the Searching for Happiness project. There is a project in development for CDEC Creative Catapult by my colleague Jon Dovey which builds on the findings from that project. This proposes the development of a platform for industry - The Context Engine - which would allow editors / users to plug live data into documentary content.
