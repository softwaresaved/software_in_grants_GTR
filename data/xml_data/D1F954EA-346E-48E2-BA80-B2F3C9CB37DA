&lt;p>ToM has been widely studied in young children and infants, and more recently its cognitive and neural basis has begun to be studied in adults. The main paradigm for this work requires participants to follow instructions from a speaker who does not fully share their visual perspective on the scene under discussion. Critical instructions have different meanings depending on whether or not participants successfully take the speaker's perspective into account. Previous work by the applicants, their collaborator at the University of Chicago, and others, shows that adults frequently show errors when following such instructions, and such difficulty is also observed in more sensitive measures, based on participants' eye movements during the tasks. By adapting these tasks, the new findings will provide insights about:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the extent and limits of adults' abilities to use their ToM&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how these limits vary between cultures (Western versus Chinese) &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how they change through children's development into adults&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>whether people who are good at ToM-use have generally better social abilities.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Public understanding of the science of communication and child development.
A primary non-academic impact of our work will be in helping people to understand a fundamental basis of social co-ordination in adults, how these abilities develop in children, and how they might vary across cultures. Exciting research on the ability of infants and very young children to &amp;quot;mindread&amp;quot; has received wide public attention, and provides parents and teachers with a basis for understanding early changes in children's social abilities. However, much less work has examined these abilities in older children or adults. Our work will address this gap in understanding by investigating fundamental aspects of social understanding, how such understanding is put to work during communication, how these abilities change through mid to late childhood, and how they vary between cultures. Our work will help us understand why it is that children and adults, who are clearly capable of understanding that other people have a different point of view from them, nonetheless fail in some circumstances to take these different perspectives into account. Such failures correspond to everyday experience of difficulty with communication, and it is of popular interest to know how and when such difficulties might arise and how they might be overcome.

Audiences of teachers, parents and the public at large will be reached through 1) outreach work that we undertake in collaboration with Birmingham Thinktank (the Birmingham Science Museum - see accompanying letter of support), where we conduct demonstrations and discussion sessions with visitors to the museum, 2) public seminars and discussion sessions at the annual British Science Festival, and 3) &amp;quot;debriefing&amp;quot; activities with schools where we test, which may involve a talk or a letter to staff/parents, explaining our research findings and putting them in broader context. In addition to these activities we will take opportunities to disseminate our findings more widely to the public. For example, the PI (Apperly) has appeared on local BBC radio to discuss research findings on &amp;quot;mindreading&amp;quot;, and his work has been highlighted in both New Scientist and Science magazines.

Capacity building
The named researcher, Jessica Wang, already has experience with running computer-based eye-tracking experiments using the Eyelink1000 system. This expertise will be extended to the conduct of &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; (i.e. not computer-based) experiments in which participants interact with another person. This will extend Jessica Wang's training to the Eyelink2 head-mounted system, and will bring the capacity to conduct such &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; studies to the Birmingham group.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>315992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have been used to communicate to the public about the scientific study of social perspective-taking during communication, and more generally about the contribution of scientific psychology to our understanding of everyday successful and unsuccessful communication. 
Our findings were presented in summary form, together with background contextual information, at a series of outreach events held at Birmingham Thinktank (science museum) during the course of the grant. These events involved researchers on the project presenting this material, and just as importantly, engaging informally with several hundred members of the public (adults and children).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C2CCCC70-6D5A-4453-8B9A-3E4DF17BDD85</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Basic paradigm.
The core paradigm for our project involved participants moving objects around a set of shelves, as directed by an avatar standing on the opposite side of the shelves, who could see some but not all of the items. Critical trials required participants to take the avatar's perspective into account when interpreting her instructions.
 
Key results.
- We found a strong effect of task instructions, which helps explain widely varying results in previous literature. Participants fail to take the avatar's perspective into account up to half the time, unless the task instructions explicitly tell them how her perspective constrains reference. Since real life rarely comes with such instructions, we believe that people often fail in real life because they do not spontaneously attend to how speaker's perspective constrains reference.
- Contrary to a previous high-profile paper, we found that participants from an &amp;quot;Eastern&amp;quot; culture (Taiwan) were just as egocentric as participants from a &amp;quot;Western&amp;quot; culture, and also showed equivalent &amp;quot;altercentric&amp;quot; biases due to tracking the perspective of the avatar.
- Adult participants showed stronger egocentric biases when the director's instructions to move objects were more complex, but not were not affected by the number of objects, or the number of objects that the avatar could not see.
- Children made more egocentric errors when the director's instructions were more complex, but this effect was equivalent in younger and older children, suggesting that this effect is independent from age-related improvement on the task.

- The findings from the developmental study are now published in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, in a special issue related to our topic.

- The findings from the first collection of eye-tracking studies has been presented as a paper at 2 international conference, as a poster at a further 3 conferences. The developmental study has been presented as a paper and a poster at 2 international conferences, the cross-cultural study has been presented as a poster at a specialised workshop. All 3 studies have been presented at a School seminar at University of Sheffield and University of Potsdam.

- The named researcher (Wang) has carried out 2 week-long &amp;quot;meet-the-scientist&amp;quot; events at Birmingham Thinktank (science museum), running demonstration of a simplified version of our key tasks.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The immediate audience for these results is a range of academic psychologists, linguists and communication scientists, interested in the relationship between perspective-taking and discourse. Our findings in relation to task instructions and task complexity will result in a synthesis of currently discrepant findings in the literature and will inform future work with this and related paradigms.

A medium-term audience consists of academics and industry workers (for example in the games industry) working on human-computer interaction. Our work provides important guidance on what can and cannot be expected for humans interacting with computer avatars as well as with other humans, and indicates ways for making such interaction more effective.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D94163CE-D7A7-41C9-AB52-37F112419C22</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/33208998-5A7B-458C-8DFC-8F1F7CAE76E5"><gtr:id>33208998-5A7B-458C-8DFC-8F1F7CAE76E5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Language complexity modulates 8- and 10-year-olds' success at using their theory of mind abilities in a communication task.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental child psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1bad307e546826cc7aec93d29c8aa80f"><gtr:id>1bad307e546826cc7aec93d29c8aa80f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wang JJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-0965</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J012238/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
