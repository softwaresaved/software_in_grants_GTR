post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other problems with anxiety.

&lt;p>The main objective of the current project is to identify parental factors that influence child psychological responses to trauma, particularly the development of PTSD symptomatology. To this end, a longitudinal investigation of parental responses to child trauma will be completed. Comprehensive assessments of parents and their 7-12 year old children will be obtained over a six month period following child exposure to trauma. Both general parental behaviours relevant to child anxiety and trauma specific responses based on models of PTSD will be examined. Parental behaviours post-trauma that predict good versus poor outcomes in children at six month follow up will be identified.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will inform the development of guidance for parents in supporting their child following trauma, and may identify aspects of parental responding that are potential treatment targets in interventions for child PTSD.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is relatively common for children to experience potentially traumatic events, and to develop PTSD symptoms as a consequence. Potentially, parents of traumatised children may play an important role in facilitating child psychological adjustment. Despite this, at present, there is no systematic psychological advice or support given to families following the experience of trauma. This may represent a significant missed opportunity, as providing parents with guidance on how best to help their child post-trauma has the potential to improve child outcomes. At the same time, systematic investigation of the role of parents in influencing child psychological adjustment following trauma has not been conducted, and therefore there isn't an adequate evidence base to support the development of empirically-driven intervention targeting parental factors. 

The proposed research comprises a comprehensive examination of parental influences in relation to child psychological adjustment post-trauma. In the event that significant parental influences are identified, preliminary work will be completed in relation to drafting guidance for parents of traumatised children. Consquently, there is clear potential for impact at multiple levels. Academically, the research is likely to be of immediate benefit to other researchers who are working to understand child psychological difficulties post-trauma; and may be of particular importance to those who are working to develop more effective psychological treatments for PTSD in children. In the longer term, the proposed work may have impact for policy makers, hospitals and other agencies who deal with child trauma, and for children and families who themselves experience traumatic events. Specifically, if the output from our research ultimately allows for a more informed approach to supporting traumatised children and their families it may: a) at a policy level, result in the routine provision of information for families affected by child trauma; b) provide guidance for professionals who routinely interact with child trauma populations; c) contribute to the development of psychological interventions for child PTSD that target parental behaviours of importance; and d) through each of these routes, be of value in aiding traumatised children in their psychological recovery. 

PTSD, and other psychological reactions to trauma, can be both highly persistent and extremely disabling. Child sufferers may experience broader adjustment problems, including school failure and social problems, in addition to the severe distress associated with their psychological difficulties. As such, our research has the potential for longer term positive impact on wellbeing in children experiencing trauma.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>348898</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Stellenbosch</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Psychology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Mark Tomlinson/Stellenbosch University</gtr:description><gtr:id>A48BD7C7-B718-4144-B5A7-07CFEC499674</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have agreed/obtained funding to develop a collaboration around the high risk populations that Prof. Tomlinson studies in South Africa.

However, initial key findings are as follows. 

1. Meta-analysis of data from the existing literature tracked the occurrence and severity of PTSD over the course of a year following trauma exposure in young people. Results indicated that PTSD symptoms (e.g., bad dreams about the trauma, feeling 'jumpy' or easily startled) are relatively common to experience within the first month of a traumatic event. For children who experience high symptoms of PTSD and meet criteria for a diagnosis, about 50% will show a reduction in symptoms to below clinical levels, across the 6 months after the event. However, there is little evidence of further change in rates of PTSD or symptom severity after 6 months. Therefore, if a child still meets criteria for a PTSD diagnosis 6 months post-trauma, it is unlikely that they would lose a PTSD diagnosis without formal intervention.

2. A study carrying out in-depth interviews with parents to investigate responses to their child's trauma highlighted the fact that parents use many positive strategies to support their child after a traumatic event, including; providing extra care, opportunities to discuss what happened, and making an effort to resume normal routines. However, they also sometimes provide support in ways that may prolong child distress, for example by advocating avoidance of trauma related places or activities, or being highly protective in order to prevent future harm. The way that parents respond to children following trauma are heavily influenced by parents' own feelings of helplessness and anxiety following the event.
Some parental responses were also influenced by their perceptions of care from medical staff; confusing or limited information about child recovery contributed to parents' anxiety and difficulty resuming normal routines. Parents described a need for more guidance and support regarding their child's physical and emotional recovery.

3. We have also generated evidence in relation to the potential for parents to influence child recovery following trauma, through the support they provide. First, a meta-analysis of the existing literature indicated that general negative parental responses to children following trauma (particularly overprotective parenting) are reliably associated with child PTSD symptom levels. Second, our own longitudinal research examined trauma specific parental responses, and found that how the parent particularly intervenes in relation to the child's initial posttraumatic distress is a relatively strong predictor of subsequent child symptoms 6 months later, even once the child's initial symptom levels are taken into account. In particular, the way that the parent perceives the child following the event (e.g., as damaged or vulnerable) was just as important as the way that they responded (e.g., by promoting avoidance of trauma material or forgetting). An overwhelming majority of parents reported needing more information about how to help their child posttrauma. Nonetheless, overall, parental responses were highly supportive and positive. 

4. We have extended our UK research to examine a high risk international population in South Africa, in a community where children are vulnerable to multiple traumas and comparatively severe events. This research has highlighted the need to consider contextual factors when attempting to understand parental responses to child posttraumatic distress. For example, parents from the community strongly encouraged avoidance of trauma related places and activities, frequently gave dire warnings to the child about their vulnerability and the likelihood of future trauma, and endorsed forgetting as a main coping strategy for the child. These responses would be considered problematic according the outcomes of our UK study, but may be highly appropriate when the actual level of ongoing threat that is present for families in the community is markedly high.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are relevant to clinicians and families supporting children following trauma.
