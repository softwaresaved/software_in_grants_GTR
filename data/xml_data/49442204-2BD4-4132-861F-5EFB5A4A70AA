The two decades since the fall of communism and the demise of the multinational USSR, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia have seen sustained efforts by international organisations (most especially the Council of Europe, OSCE and EU) to enact a credible national minority rights regime capable of preventing the emergence or resurgence of ethnic conflicts within this region. Minority rights are of course not simply an issue in relation to CEE: discussion of this region can be situated within the context of broader debates on integration of minority communities and the possibility of reconfiguring existing nation states along lines of democratic multiculturalism. One particular feature of recent minority rights development in CEE has been the adoption by several states of laws based on the principle of non-territorial cultural autonomy (NTCA). First elaborated in Austro-Hungary at the turn of the 20th century, NTCA is based on the premise that in an areas of ethnically mixed settlement, rights to minority autonomy cannot be allocated to particular territorial regions; rather, these rights must be allocated to public collectivities of persons, constituted on the basis of individual citizens freely opting to enrol on a national register and elect their own institutions with responsibility for minority schooling and other cultural affairs. This model has attracted growing interest from contemporary scholars and practitioners of minority rights, who see it as possible way of conceptually separating ethnicity from territory and thereby alleviating fears that greater minority rights might undermine the stability and integrity of existing states. For all of this interest, however, there is still a lack of detailed comparative research on NTCA that seeks to determine the factors and agendas behind the revival of NTCA laws, the actual roles performed by NTCA institutions that have been established and the implications that NTCA carries for identity and the construction of statehood and political community within the post-communist CEE region. The broad aim of the proposed research is to address this gap in the literature by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of debates and practices around NTCA in five states where the model has had particular salience in recent times: Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Russia and Serbia. The project will also set the findings from these CEE cases within a broader context through expert seminars involving academic theoreticians of NTCA as well as scholars and policymakers working in and on other states (e.g. Belgium, Canada, Israel, Turkey) where NTCA is either used or mooted as a model for managing ethnic diversity. The findings will be novel, interesting and relevant not only academically, but also for organisations engaged in the development of a European minority rights regime. From a range of settings spanning the entire CEE region, including EU member, prospective member and partner states, the research will give a fuller and more nuanced understanding of whether NTCA is helping to integrate communities or whether it in fact reifies ethnic divisions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is partly inspired by and builds upon a more historically focused study by the PI of NTCA practice in Central and Eastern Europe during the inter-war period, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council during 2003-2008 (additional funding was allocated to the original project in 2006 under the AHRC pilot non-academic user dissemination initiative). The latter project involved substantial policymaker engagement, and has since been showcased by AHRC as one of its impact case studies. Specifically, the funder noted the impact of the research in terms of: feeding into public policy on the role of minorities and multiculturalism; providing expert knowledge in the drafting of laws on cultural autonomy to CEE governments; and furthering understanding in international relations and policy (see: http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/What-We-Do/Strengthen-research-impact/Impact-examples/Pages/Public-policy-on-minorty-rights.aspx). In addition to briefing work and joint seminars with the governments of Romania and Armenia, the Council of Europe Venice Commission and the European Centre for Minority Issues, the project included participation by former UK Home Secretary the Rt Hon Charles Clarke, as part of his current work on issues of faith and multiculturalism. Mr Clarke wrote a preface to the final project monograph (Smith &amp;amp; Hiden 2012) in which he highlighted the salience of historical NTCA discussions to current debates in the UK, the wider Europe and beyond.

This new, more contemporary-focused project will engage actively with pre-existing academic-practitioner networks established during 2003-2008 and is likely to be of even more direct public policy relevance and benefit than its predecessor. Academic impacts have already been alluded to in the section on Academic Beneficiaries; in the practitioner realm, the project will benefit all of the aforementioned public and third sector actors, as well as other users such as the OSCE, European Commission, UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (sponsor of our previous policy briefing in Romania, under the auspices of ECMI) and national governments and autonomous minority institutions across Central and Eastern Europe and more broadly. Giving a clearer picture of the practices and everyday experiences and perspectives around NTCA will greatly assist the evaluation and formulation of minority rights policy within particular states and at international level and help to improve the effectiveness of public services. Dissemination of project findings through various media also has the potential to inform broader public understandings of national minorities, their identities and aspirations and their role in public life, thereby enhancing the quality of and potential for cross-cultural interactions within the societies concerned and more widely. The findings of the project will be brought to bear during 2015-2020 within a context of growing EU engagement with Serbia as a prospective member state and of efforts to further the minority rights agenda in the countries of the EU neighbourhood, as part of the current European Neighbourhood Policy approach of 'more for more'. Current regionally-based movements for devolution or even secession within the EU as well as ongoing discussions in relation to Kosovo and Turkey mean that NTCA looks likely to become an ever-more salient item on the European political agenda during this period. In so far as it can help to shift the frame of minority debates away from securitisation towards democratisation and participation, the research will also inform agendas of societal integration and help to foster an understanding of minority communities as a positive resource and source of innovation which can assist in the realisation of the EU's Europe 2020 growth strategy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>603010</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>International Glaucoma Association (IGA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ILA</gtr:description><gtr:id>B9CD9AA6-A150-4CC3-BF2A-6E6B758DDC44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The final co-authored report will be adopted in 2018, and will directly support the remit of the new ILA Committee, which is to: select key cases in the domain of land rights from different regions of the world; apply an interdisciplinary analysis of such cases; and &amp;quot;pay attention to economic factors and actors, with a focus on state and third parties, including multinational companies, and the role they are playing, positively and negatively, in the lives of Indigenous communities.

Here a workplan was discussed and guidelines drawn up for the work.
While our research project does not focus directly on the rights of indigenous peoples (as legally distinct from those of national minorities) in Russia, at least one of the case studies we encountered during our fieldwork touches upon this dimension. More broadly the work towards the report (and its consideration at the ILA Seventh Biennial International Conference ('International law and state practice: is there a North - South Divide?', Johannesburg, 7-11 August 2016) will provide additional valuable insights into (quoting the Committee's work plan guidelines) &amp;quot;what legal, quasi-legal and practical barriers potentially block the road from international legal standards to actual protection in a number of areas of the world&amp;quot;</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Research team member Federica Prina was invited by the Committee on the Implementation of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of the International Law Association (ILA) to participate in research on judgements on land and fishing rights of indigenous people in Russia.

Alexander Osipov has assisted with relevant contacts for our fieldwork in Russia. The Centre provided financial and administrative support to a conference ('Trans-ethnic Coalition-Building within and across States') organised by Smith in Uppsala in January 2015 with a large conference grant from the Swedish Social Science Research Foundation (Riksbanken Jubileumsfond) and its in-house periodical (Journal for Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe) published a special issue (2015/2) based on selected papers from the conference.
 
ECMI also provided matching funding towards the jointly-organised event which took place in Kyiv in June 2016, and which was badged as part of its regular EPP programme. The Centre also proposed additional speakers for the event and drew upon its existing contacts in order to decide upon the list of invited participants. ECMI also secured the agreement of its existing partner, the I.F. Kuras Institute of Political and Ethnic Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, to host the event.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>ECMI was included as a collaborative partner under the application for the current ESRC research project, and one of the project Research Associates, Federica Prina, formerly worked at the Centre.
 
In 2014 Smith was appointed to the Centre's International Advisory Board, and participated in its annual meeting in December of that year. Thereafter, the research team at Glasgow accepted an invitation to become part of the editorial team for ECMI's flagship annual publication, the European Yearbook of Minority Issues. This involves ... 
 

In partnership with ECMI our project co-organised and co-funded (using the grant detailed under 'further funding') an academic-practitioner seminar on minority non-territorial self-government, which took place in Kyiv, Ukraine on 2-3 June 2016 within the framework of ECMI's regular European Partnership Programme seminars co-funded by the Danish Government. The seminar was organised on the initiative of our project, and used to disseminate the findings of our wider research project to a range of stakeholders, including representatives of minority and human rights NGOs, public officials, academic experts and representatives of the European Commission and the Office of the OSCE High Commissioner on Minority Rights) engaged with current reforms in Ukraine. All members of the project team (Smith, Molnar Sansum and Prina) participated, as well as additional speakers and participants recruited through our contact networks.

In 2015 Smith was also engaged as a coordinator for the 'national developments' section of ECMI's flagship annual publication, The European Yearbook of Minority Issues (published by Brill and widely used by policymakers and experts). This role involves identifying the most salient country cases and topics to be included in the volume in a given year, identifying authors and soliciting, reviewing and approving articles for inclusion. Smith and Prina have worked together to fulfill this role during 2015-16.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Kyiv Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FDD512EB-0854-4998-87B2-5DADFE999686</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In June 2016, as part of our spin-off IAA project on Ukraine, we arranged a conference on 'Non-Territorial National-Cultural Self-Government: The Ukrainian Perspective' at the Kuras Institute of Political and Ethnic Studies at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv. This conference was co-organised with the Kuras Institute and with ECMI, as part of its Eastern Partnership Programme &amp;quot;National Minorities and Ethnopolitical Issues. Belarus - Moldova - Ukraine&amp;quot;. 

The conference brief was: to discuss the meaning of non-territorial cultural self-government, the shapes it can take and the opportunities it opens up; and to discuss future research, practical solutions, and the direction of future cooperation between scholars and practitioners in Ukraine and Europe. The event attracted 50 speakers and participants, including representatives of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine (responsible for minority issues), a range of national minority NGOs, the Office of the OSCE High Commissioner of National Minorities and - at our invitation - the Support Group for Ukraine (Political issues) at the DG Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations of the European Commission.

During the event we presented a panel outlining the preliminary findings from our research on non-territorial autonomy, giving an overview of arrangements in Hungary, Serbia and Estonia. The panel stimulated a lively debate among participants, and a variety of responses. It is clear that the idea of autonomy goes somewhat against the grain as far as current official policy making in Ukraine is concerned. However, several representatives of national minority organisations present at the conference (especially the Hungarian minority speaker) declared our findings to be of considerable interest and relevance to the current situation. The conference opened the way to continued contacts with this person, and informed the decision to try and engage more fully with minority organisations during the remainder of the project, which has prompted the joint activity organised with FUEN in May 2017. Overall the conference was useful in identifying various flexible ways in which the autonomy concept can be defined and applied to particular circumstances. This dimension was developed more fully in the working paper on the Hungarian minority that was subsequently drafted by David Smith and a Ukrainian colleague, and published by ECMI.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ecmi-epp.org/?p=2565</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Study visit by interns from Ukraine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>10A459D7-D2F3-4042-B0CD-618ED25279FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The first phase of the additional ESRC Impact Acceleration Account initiative developed under our project involved a one-week visit to Scotland (28 February-6 March 2016) by two policy experts from Ukraine working on minority rights issues in the country. One works as a local representative for the office of the OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities and for the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions; the other heads the National Minorities section of one of the country's largest policy think thanks, and regularly engages in dialogue with policy makers in Ukraine, as well as working with the OSCE and other international organisations. During the week we outlined our project to the visitors, presented some of our preliminary findings drawn from our core case studies elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe and together we discussed the potential applicability of NTCA practices to Ukraine's current reform process. A further strand of the activity was to acquaint our visitors with Scotland's own experience in the area of devolution and accommodation of ethnic and linguistic diversity. This discussion will feed into a joint briefing paper to be prepared ahead of the joint academic-practitioner seminar (phase 2 of the project) which will take place in Kyiv on 2-3 June 2016.

As part of the visit we also organised meetings with the International Affairs section of the Scottish Parliament, Beyond Borders Scotland (an Edinburgh-based NGO working on peace-building dialogue and conflict regulation), the former and current UK representatives to the Expert Committee of the Council of Europe's European Charter on Regional and Minority Languages (both of whom are Edinburgh-based). We also organised a visit to the Glasgow Gaelic School. As well as informing our work with the Ukrainian partners going forward, these activities also gave us the opportunity to showcase our research project to a variety of new audiences.

As part of this work we have also initiated cooperation with a further Ukraine-based expert working with the OSCE HCNM on issues connected with the Hungarian minority in western Ukraine. This expert later co-authored a briefing paper on this topic with David Smith, which was published by the European Centre for Minority Issues in September 2016. A further working paper on the autonomy structures of the Crimean Tatars, co-authored with one of the visiting policy experts, is also under preparation, and will be published in 2017.

As a result of this activity we are now in contact with the Head of the East European Section of the OSCE HCNM office in the Hague, who has expressed a strong interest in our research findings. We have exchanged emails on the topic of cultural autonomy in Central and Eastern Europe, and the Section Head and one of his colleagues have accepted our invitation to participate in our project seminar and Round Table with FUEN that are being organised in Cluj in May 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>6634</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ESRC Impact Acceleration Account</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Glasgow</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>ES/M500471/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>1B0C5AE2-A4AB-469A-A936-E5A698108D96</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5F70A8C8-04C3-45CB-9E8F-BBE1BD78AD6B"><gtr:id>5F70A8C8-04C3-45CB-9E8F-BBE1BD78AD6B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Minority Accommodation through Territorial and Non-Territorial Autonomy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/da614a99d401d7f63b0e51a0a44c5ad0"><gtr:id>da614a99d401d7f63b0e51a0a44c5ad0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith, D.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780198746669</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/376455D0-1E80-414A-848F-150CF6DD83F0"><gtr:id>376455D0-1E80-414A-848F-150CF6DD83F0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Position of National Minorities in Putin's Russia: Uniformity or Diversity?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c454c729c9bb311d43b143d4d7da9210"><gtr:id>c454c729c9bb311d43b143d4d7da9210</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Prina, F.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CC93119E-08A4-43F4-ACAD-14FA10C7B01C"><gtr:id>CC93119E-08A4-43F4-ACAD-14FA10C7B01C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Some thoughts about the intercultural strategies of the Hungarian Roma</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cb2f43fbe09f9b94d05efa738ba0b21d"><gtr:id>cb2f43fbe09f9b94d05efa738ba0b21d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Moln?r, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D5D5F33F-F495-4F89-99C2-6E92B55A493E"><gtr:id>D5D5F33F-F495-4F89-99C2-6E92B55A493E</gtr:id><gtr:title>National Cultural Autonomy: Russia's Model, the Tatars and Ethno-Cultural Education</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Tatarica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c454c729c9bb311d43b143d4d7da9210"><gtr:id>c454c729c9bb311d43b143d4d7da9210</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Prina, F.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FDA502C7-DEDD-4F9B-B264-6F4AF2B0BB51"><gtr:id>FDA502C7-DEDD-4F9B-B264-6F4AF2B0BB51</gtr:id><gtr:title>Routledge Handbook of Ethnic Conflict</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f0e6f2f52b3aecc428327496834decf9"><gtr:id>f0e6f2f52b3aecc428327496834decf9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3648AFF5-7D61-4873-82DA-C4EA836F75C5"><gtr:id>3648AFF5-7D61-4873-82DA-C4EA836F75C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transethnic coalition-building: definitions, practices and possibilities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8a3924c15daac42ab8076d5868168271"><gtr:id>8a3924c15daac42ab8076d5868168271</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith, D.
