Constructing an evidence base of contemporary Mediterranean migrations&amp;quot; seeks to conduct urgent data collection and essential analysis on the Mediterranean migration crisis and to make these swiftly and publicly available to policymakers, practitioners, migrant community support organisations, and the research community. 

EVI-MED will provide insights into the major humanitarian, social, economic and political implications for the principal countries of arrival - above all Italy and Greece - as well as Malta which is a central pillar of the search and rescue effort. The project is also relevant to other potential countries of reception and settlement in Europe, including the United Kingdom. This will be achieved through a diversity of research methods, including:

A) The collection and standardization of a broad range of secondary data on migration, including statistics provided by search and rescue organisations and national and European bodies which will be integrated with data-sets made available by international NGOs, to create a synthetic database on migration trends and characteristics of flows.

B) A survey of individual migrants - with at least 750 participants across Sicily, Greece and Malta - providing insight into profiles, routes, experiences and migration plans. This survey data will be complemented by 45 in-depth interviews focusing on migrant life-histories, decision making and use of networks.

C) A systematic mapping of the 'reception systems' in Sicily, Greece and Malta, identifying governmental and non-governmental actors involved in the identification, management, reception, integration and potential return of migrants who make the journey across the Mediterranean.

D) Overall analysis of the migration and reception situation, derived from the above data-sets and integrated with further interviews with experts and practitioners, the contribution of international advisors, and the evidence emerging from the existing literature and other research and ongoing research activities. 

The project benefits from close collaboration with a number of well-established specialist organisations, including the Greek Council for Refugees, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), Migrant Report, Borderline Sicily, People for Change Foundation Malta and with expert knowledge of countries of origin provided by the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat (RMMS), a project of the Danish Refugee Council working in the Horn of Africa and Middle East. 

EVI-MED's wide-ranging engagement platform capitalises on the network of collaborations and partnerships established with Middlesex's Mediterranean Observatory on Migration Protection and Asylum (MOMPA) - a joint initiative of Middlesex University London and Middlesex University Malta.

The project outputs - including data-sets, policy briefs, academic articles, situation reports, interactive maps - will be made available through the project website, in order to advertise them as widely as possible through EVI-MED's 'engagement platform', networks and social media provided by partners and collaborating organisations. Other outputs include conferences, knowledge exchange events, consultations and briefings with national and European policymakers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>EVI-MED aims to generate a positive impact for the following groups.

Beneficiaries include all 28 EU member states and migrant receiving states/countries of resettlement including Norway, Switzerland USA. 

(5) Migrants/Refugees and others in countries of origin. Refugees, family migrants, economic migrants and others will benefit from the provision of a map of services and public database on access points and areas of high danger; which will also strengthen the capacity of the organisations supporting them. 

(6) NGOs including relief agencies and migrants centres will benefit from 'data validation' and analysis of information and data on flows and services. This will enable the more effective use of funds and better planning for reception, integration and future return scenarios. Key beneficiaries include: Italy: Borderline Sicily, Caritas, Emergency, MSF, JRS. Greece: Greek Refugee Council, MSF, Migrant Files. Malta: Aditus, Catholic Church's Emigrants' Commission, Jesuit Relief Services; Migrant Offshore Aid Station; MSF; SOS Malta; Victim Support.

(7) International Organisations (IGOs and INGOs) will benefit from 'data validation' and analysis and joint dissemination efforts. Key beneficiaries include: International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD); ICRC; IOM; International Maritime Organisation; UNHCR.

(8) Private Sector. Evidence used to inform search and rescue efforts will impact on management of traffic across the Mediterranean and benefit commercial shipping and the tourist industry, especially in the Aegean islands and Lampedusa.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161445</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Parliament Information Office</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>EVI-MED Partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>B74D86EB-B54F-4F94-971D-1D2C209E81AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>European Parliament Information Officer - hosted an event and social media campaign; Living with Migration; 28 October 2015

This softening/hardening is evident in the contest between effective border management and the protection of human rights, above all the right to asylum. What academic scholars have not recognised, however, is the differentiating and, at times, polarising effect that this dynamic has had on the provision of services, above all in matters of migrant reception. This paper presented by Professor Brad Blitz reports on a current project funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council and UK Department of International Development (DFID) which aims to conduct urgent data collection and essential analysis on the Mediterranean 'migration crisis' and to make findings swiftly available to policymakers, practitioners and the research community. This paper includes three case studies from Greece, Italy and Malta, providing an insight into the profiles, routes, experiences and plans of individual migrants and maps the 'reception systems' in these countries. This paper informs our understanding of the hardening and softening of borders within the European Union and the management of humanitarian protection in both countries of arrival and relocation within the European Union. This presentation generated a podcast, blog post and further research projects including collaboration on November conference organised by the New Europeans and Federal Trust in London; and a forthcoming conference in Greece in July 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/events/migration-protection-and-reception-crisis-mediterranean</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Summer School -  The Refugee Crisis &amp; the European Union's Response: Context, Management &amp; Challenges, University of Barcelona, 18 -23 July 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7A9C3512-CF64-4C8F-B121-74B6B8B6FFC4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Summer School - The Refugee Crisis &amp;amp; the European Union's Response: Context, Management &amp;amp; Challenges, University of Barcelona, 18 -23 July 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Brad Blitz LBC radio interview with Ian Payne LBC News, 15:34 and 15:51, 27 December</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>75CDB652-130D-4AF7-B084-8AB7C0530A43</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Brad Blitz LBC radio interview with Ian Payne (LBC News, 15:34 and 15:51), 27 December</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CIDOB, Barcelona.

The session brought together two projects (funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council), currently working in parallel and investigating the Mediterranean migration crisis as this unfolds in three main locations, Sicily, Malta and the Eastern Aegean islands. Based on original quantitative and qualitative field-research we offered a critical comparative review of the technologies used to monitor migration in these regions. We focused on the procedures of screening, defining and categorising subjects and on their effects in the production of migrant/refugee subjectivities and taxonomies. The representation of subjects in terms of economic migrants/refugees, age, gender and kin relationships, has a bearing on the ways they are designated as being worthy of protection, or not, and recipients of resources from the state, NGOs and civil society. In addition, Alessio d'Angelo provided a 'critical map' of Sicily, discussing and visualising a rapidly evolving scenario and raising questions about the near future and lessons to be learned.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://evimedresearch.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/imiscoe-spring-conference-2016/#more-52</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The migration crisis: is the whole world moving around and about to crash into Europe's borders?, talk by Eleonore Kofman, George Monoux School, Walthamstow, 12 June 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0F5AD0F-CE51-417C-8621-946BFF954DBB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The migration crisis: is the whole world moving around and about to crash into Europe's borders?, talk by Eleonore Kofman, George Monoux School, Walthamstow, 12 June 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'The Past and present - Forced Migration in the Western Balkans Region', Conference on the Long-Term Effects Of Forced Migration In Bosnia And Herzegovina, Serbia And Kosovo -Gender Perspective Of Psychosocial Health Among Returnees, Refugees And Internally Displaced Persons, Hotel Europe, Sarajevo,  15 November 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB318186-DCDF-44A0-9F0A-7D2C80F2D7DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'The Past and present - Forced Migration in the Western Balkans Region', Conference on the Long-Term Effects Of Forced Migration In Bosnia And Herzegovina, Serbia And Kosovo -Gender Perspective Of Psychosocial Health Among Returnees, Refugees And Internally Displaced Persons, Hotel Europe, Sarajevo, 15 November 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.rrpp-westernbalkans.net/en/News/Conference-on-long-term-effects-of-forced-migration-.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> 'Group Specific Dimensions of Re-integration  - Return and Reintegration in the Migration Context', Expert Forum, Deutsche Gesellschaft f?r Internationale Zusammenarbeit, Eschborn, Germany,  1 March 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1629763D-F872-4ABF-B151-92538E408097</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Group Specific Dimensions of Re-integration - Return and Reintegration in the Migration Context', Expert Forum, Deutsche Gesellschaft f&amp;uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit, Eschborn, Germany, 1 March 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Refugee crisis or reception crisis?

Chair: The Rt Hon the Baroness Amos
Recent disturbing scenes in and around the Mediterranean have highlighted the huge challenges faced by Europe in general and the EU in particular in dealing with the challenges of migration. The tens of thousands risking their lives by desperately trying to cross into Europe from North Africa and Turkey have put under new strain current policies at national and EU level, and tested the concept of European solidarity to its limits and beyond. Franco-British relations are once again being damaged by thousands of immigrants gathered at Calais to try to cross into the UK. Routes from Turkey through the Balkans are also generating major political strains. Immigration has 
become an even more toxic political question in many countries, feeding nationalism and populism, and in some cases Euroscepticism. The underlying paradox is that many countries in Europe will increasingly need significant levels of immigration as their working populations fall.
The reality is that, whatever the current economic and social problems of Europe, it offers dramatically better life chances for millions of people in the Middle East and North Africa affected by conflict, poverty and poor governance. The numbers of genuine refugees fleeing war and persecution in Syria, Iraq, Eritrea and too many other countries of the region are swelled by economic migrants willing to risk death for a chance of a better future. 
Once in Europe, the experience may be disappointing but the chances of forced return are small.Current policies are attempting to tackle the issues from many angles: dealing with the root causes of poverty and conflict; humanitarian aid on the spot for those who have fled their homes; measures to target people traffickers; interception of boats at sea to save lives; humane reception arrangements for those who successfully make the crossing; identification and separation of genuine asylum seekers; return of others to countries of origin; 
burden-sharing between European countries and help for the countries in the front line. However,there seems little 
current chance of reducing the flow, or of a political response including more generous relocation and resettlement policies. This raises some key questions.
Can the flow be reduced in the absence of peace settlements to the main conflicts, particularly Syria? Why is
diplomacy still struggling to make an impact here? Can Europe make enough of a difference to good governance and economic devel
opment in the affected countries (whose high population growth rates are making the problems worse) to persuade more people to stay where they are and,if so,how? How are patterns of migration likely to evolve in the next few years? Can more humane and ge
nerous resettlement arrangements, including fair and legitimate burden-sharing, and better legal ways of moving to Europe, be put in place without increasing the pull factors? How can Europe control immigration sufficiently to combat xenophobia and populis
m, and allow immigrants of choice to contribute to economic growth? Does the current situation threaten internal freedom of 
movement within the EU, as national governments try to control their own borders? This conference will bring together politicians, 
officials, experts and others from across Europe and more widely to examine the dilemmas and make policy recommendations in this most difficult of areas.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ditchley.co.uk/assets/media/Conference%20Description%20Europe%20and%20migratino.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Restrictions on migration of family members and implications for family life, Migration and Families in Europe: National and Local Perspectives at a Time of Euroskepticism' Plenary speaker, 7-8 February 2017, Manchester University - plenary address by Eleonore Kofman</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0B7E5CCC-3627-4D45-8AD8-A50ECCE3B109</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Restrictions on migration of family members and implications for family life, Migration and Families in Europe: National and Local Perspectives at a Time of Euroskepticism' Plenary speaker, 7-8 February, Manchester University, plenary address by Eleonore Kofman</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> EU Valletta Summit on Migration  11-12 November 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3D4969D8-7C49-4DA9-B983-64B79B699897</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Valletta Summit on Migration held in Valletta, Malta, on 11-12 November, and brought together European and African heads of state or government in an effort to strengthen cooperation in the area of migration.

2. The nature of migrants' journeys including evidence of abuse, ill-treatment and illness en route. 

3. The development of multi-actor governance based on complex interactions between international organisations, national governments, local authorities, formal NGOs and civil society associations involved in the reception of asylum seekers and refugees

4. The different ideas and modalities of reception

5. The need for socially disaggregated data for adults and children

6. Gendered mobilities, protection and vulnerabilities in Greece and Italy.

7. The impact of EU policy, in particular the EU-Turkey statement, and the changing relationship between internal dispersal, relocation and family reunification under Dublin.

8. Increasing applications for asylum in Mediterranean countries and formal/informal integration processes
