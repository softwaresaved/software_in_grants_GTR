The citizens were not that different either; they were ready to pay in order to get the 'true' time in their homes. The most common technologies involved electric systems. There was, however, one odd case, the case of Paris, where time was distributed to the city's public clocks and its citizens' homes through a pneumatic system. It literally was pumped through pipes in the form of compressed air. And this system continued to work for almost half a century, between 1880-1927.\n\nBut how did it really work? What led to the installation of such a system? Where were the public clocks located and why? Which neighbourhoods did the pneumatic system serve? Where were their factories located? How did the pneumatic time distribution system work, and, above all, how was it maintained? What drove people to pay to get connected to pneumatic time pipes? Why did the city government have this system installed? How did the general public feel about it? And what led to its disappearance?\n\nThis research addresses these questions through original archival research on the histories and geographies of pneumatic time distribution in Paris from an everyday urban point of view. It focuses on how this technology worked, was used, maintained and talked about. And it refers to all these elements as the city's 'temporal infrastructure'. Therefore, it not only fills a significant research gap by providing the first comprehensive account of this technology, but also proposes a new way of looking at and understanding cities through the prism of temporal infrastructures.\n\nThis research makes key contributions in three areas:\n\ni) Empirical and conceptual contribution to the academic literatures on history of timekeeping and time distribution, urban infrastructures, historical geographies of cities, history of mass consumption, and history of technology;\nii) Strengthening partnerships between academic institutions and the third sector (museums, in particular) - both within and outside the UK - through collaborations in research, PhD studentships, and exhibitions; and\niii) Developing Royal Holloway as a major international hub for research, collaboration and PhD studentship in the study of temporal infrastructures of cities in a variety of historical periods and geographical contexts.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's potential impacts for non-academic user groups are: i) Engaging a wider and actively contributing public through an open resource project website; ii) Strengthening partnerships between academic institutions and museums - both within and outside the UK - through collaborations in research, PhD studentships, and exhibitions; and iii) Developing Royal Holloway as a major international hub for research, collaboration and PhD studentship in the study of temporal infrastructures of cities in a variety of historical periods and geographical contexts.\n\nThis research will benefit two non-academic user groups: a wider public interested in time and timekeeping technologies, and, more specifically, museums. The first group will be engaged through the creation and maintenance of a project website as an open resource site. This means that it will not only make research findings available to a broader public, but will also enable them to actively contribute if they wish to.\n\nIn order to engage the second group, the PI will build on the Royal Holloway Geography Department's very strong track record of collaboration with the Science Museum, with the possibility of collaboration for doctoral studentships in the domains of urban temporal infrastructures, and technologies of time regulation and distribution.\n\nSince the research involves archival research in museums in France, the PI will also seek to make new connections and explore the potential for exhibitions on such themes as 'Technologies of Time'; 'Representing/Advertising Time'; or 'Consuming Time'.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>165100</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCD058CA-F919-4A8D-B0F6-30772A91B7E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interim findings of the project were presented to the members of the Electrical Timekeeping Group on 14 September 2013 at Guildhall Library, London.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings of the project included the following:



1. Detailed information about the different technologies for time distribution towards the end of nineteenth century in Paris. These included electric and pneumatic systems; the former was initiated by Observatory scientists as a public service, while the latter was introduced by an entrepreneur to make profit.



2. An understanding of the geography of pneumatic time distribution networks. These were located strategically in the 'showcase' neighbourhoods of Paris which were under development at the time.



3. Information on the reception of this time distribution service by the public. The Parisians had a love and hate relation with their pneumatic clocks; they cherished them, missed them when they were removed from the boulevards (as, for example, was the case during military parades), but also fiercely criticised the system whenever things went wrong.



4. The dynamics of the development of a market for time in main nineteenth century Western cities.



5. More generally, a good understanding of the main uses of pneumatic technologies in nineteenth century cities, and the place of Paris among them.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project will no doubt be useful for curators working on time, temporal infrastructures, and nineteenth-century Paris.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>94CE6D00-7654-47A4-A5EC-17EEC87C152D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture/ Heritage/ Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://pumpingtime.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E28C2B81-2A5C-4BCE-B3B9-354A4FB5B0B1"><gtr:id>E28C2B81-2A5C-4BCE-B3B9-354A4FB5B0B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>'The Modern Atlas': compressed air and cities c.1850-1930</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Historical Geography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5e5beed6850b2d98b50e959c16bb543d"><gtr:id>5e5beed6850b2d98b50e959c16bb543d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dikec, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H039414/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8990E5FE-B44F-4A5B-8FDE-0610A5BE98C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
