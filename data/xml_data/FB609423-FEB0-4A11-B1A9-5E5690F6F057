The ICG was formed in 2002 through a strategic investment from the university, and now hosts 50 researchers making it one of the largest extragalactic astronomy groups in the UK.

Cosmology and astrophysics are experiencing a golden age of discovery driven by new experiments and theoretical advances. However, we still face three fundamental challenges before a more complete model of the Universe can be achieved, including &amp;quot;What is the origin and distribution of structures in the Universe?&amp;quot;.

We will address this question by investigating models of inflation in the very early universe. This tests the laws of physics at extremely high energies where we need to account for the effects of both general relativity and quantum physics. String theory could offer a consistent picture of the very early universe, and we will test such ideas through the distribution of primordial density and metric perturbations that would be generated from quantum fluctuations during a period of inflation. We will make detailed predictions for observable quantities in the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Over recent years the ICG has established a comprehensive public engagement programme, with full-time outreach officer since 2012, including:

1) Providing popular talks to numerous local astronomical societies, local schools, festivals, and public events. The ICG delivered major BBC `Stargazing Live' eventa at Portsmouth Spinnaker Tower in January 2012 and on board HMS Warrior in 2013. We also include public talks in our professional meetings, e.g., in Nov 2011, Carlos Frenk gave a popular talk to 300 people. We will continue to deliver such popular talks at roughly one a month.

2) Contributing work experience for school students (short work visits or longer Nuffield summer bursaries). Local pupils to attend our annual &amp;quot;Cosmology Masterclass&amp;quot; to provide pupils with additional material for their physics GSCE modules. We will continue this engagement with schools, building upon our strong relationship with local teachers, SEPNet and the University school liaison officer.

3) Continuing to engage local and national media. ICG has obtained excellent local exposure with frequent articles in the Portsmouth News, many radio interviews and features on local TV news. Nationally, our staff are featured in science magazines, newspapers, and BBC science shows. We will continue to liaise with the university media office and offer all staff and postdocs professional media training.

4) Deployment of the latest technologies, e.g., ICG members are deeply involved in Galaxy Zoo (GZ), which has had phenomenal impact, including the education of GZ users via blogs and forums and the development of online teaching materials. Portsmouth is an official member of the Zooniverse &amp;quot;Citizen Science Alliance&amp;quot; and we will strengthen our involvement in a broad range of citizen science projects. We will continue to engage with these new technologies and plan to make them central to our impact agenda.

5) Engaging policy makers: Bob Nichol has lobbied STFC &amp;amp; DIUS as Chair of the STFC Far Universe Advisory Panel (FUAP). David Willetts visited the University of Portsmouth in July 2011 to discuss a range of issues including science funding, immigration and EU competition rules. We will continue this engagement with policy makers, including local MPs.

We support all staff to consider commercial applications of their research. Portsmouth is a member of the South-East Physics network (SEPnet) which is developing a new employer engagement and impact development programme. The University Research and Innovation Services provides all staff with access and training on knowledge exchange and innovation. We are in discussion with STFC Innovation Partnerships Scheme and we will host a session on industrial applications of astrophysics research as part of the National Astronomy Meeting in 2014.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>206811</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Work Experience Programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CB4D2686-F640-4FA4-9910-A05AFC95F5F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2014, 2015 and 2016 the ICG held a work experience week for Year 10 pupils to experience a cosmology research environment.
