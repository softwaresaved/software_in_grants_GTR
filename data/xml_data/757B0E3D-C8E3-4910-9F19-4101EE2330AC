is an AHRC Research Networking project that aims to explore how cultures are translated through research and data collection processes. Many researchers nowadays find themselves in research contexts where there are multilingual communities, or they are working on projects that involve people and/or events in other cultures. In these situations, they often find that they need to conduct interviews in another language, or use a language which is foreign to interviewees; or they may be required to interpret or translate a dialogue, event or document from one language to another. In these contexts researchers are often faced with methodological, practical, and ethical dilemmas as to how to interpret and explain differences in linguistic intent and meaning. Similarly, participants in these projects sometimes feel that they have been misrepresented through processes of translation and interpretation. Thus, the potential for misinterpretation and misunderstanding in translating cultures-through language-is immense. Yet little information about these linguistic processes is available, either in the literature or via research methods training programmes. 
This research network project aims to address this research gap by inviting 36 researchers to discuss the complexities and challenges they face in researching multilingually. We aim to expose-in three two-day seminars-best practice and pitfalls in researching multilingually. Researchers will be invited to discuss research design, instruments, data collection and generation, interpretation and translation, and writing up of research. The project team will synthesise the emergent findings and develop recommendations and guidelines for researching multilingually. 
These outcomes will be disseminated to the AHRC research community, public/private/third sector research organisations, and Doctoral Training Centres via a workshop. Network project findings/outcomes will also be posted on the network website so that they can be implemented by all researchers, and researching training programmes, e.g., in higher education. The network project will also result in international conferences and publications. An intended development will include a follow-up project where selected researchers' seminars will be published in a special issue of an international, peer-reviewed journal and an edited book. Overall, the outcomes of the research network project will result in improved understanding, reporting, and representation of people of other languages and the cultures in which they reside.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research network project &amp;quot;Researching Multilingually&amp;quot; will impact a range of stakeholders: 1) academic researchers across a range of disciplines, offering access to new research epistemologies, methodologies, and research tools in researching groups and individuals in more than one language; 2) research training institutions (e.g, universities/higher education organisations, AHRC/EHRC community, DTCs), who will have new teaching and research tools to train researchers; and 3) research participants themselves, who will benefit from the awareness raising and research tools that emerge from this project in that researchers will be better equipped-theoretically, methodologically, and reflexively-to engage in dialogic processes as they seek to translate cultures and the people residing within them in the writing up of their research. In particular, people in marginalised groups will benefit as researchers directly confront issues of power and representation. 

The resultant outputs-a website, a workshop, and research publications-will provide better knowledge for organisations/institutions involved in public consultation and policy development, the result of improved research methods for translating cultures, and thus, better representation of the voices of those within them. 

These outputs will be realised for both immediate and long-term use. On completion of the three two-day seminars, the research team will synthesise findings and develop recommendations. These will be made available on the project website, and disseminated to the AHRC community and DHTs through a workshop. The research team will endeavour to include community groups-including public, private, and third sector groups, accessed through their research networks and those of seminar participants-in the workshop. Further workshops may be arranged where required (time and funds permitting). Further impact will also be realised through the links we will establish with the University of Birmingham's MOSIAC team. The project team have plans for longer term outputs, which include two publications-a special issue of a journal and an edited book (the proposals for which have already been negotiated and agreed). These publications will draw on the best of the seminar presentations of researchers participating in the network.

Because the project includes research that is interdisciplinary, multiple beneficiaries within the commercial private sector, policy-makers nationally and internationally, and local government agencies and regulators are all likely to benefit from these research outcomes. As the research network project will generate new knowledge (methodologies, tools, and techniques for researching multilingually), the project outputs will result in improved understanding and representation of people and the cultures in which they reside, thereby improving the knowledge base on which economic, social, and political decisions by governments and private and third sector organisations are made. Thus, improved effectiveness of public services and policy, and improved quality of life for these translated cultural groups (including health and welfare needs) are an inevitable outcome of this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22679</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This was poster was developed for the 'Final conference, ESRC RDI project Researching multilingualism, multilingualism in research practice'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8AA60A9B-646A-4582-9C3E-5F1D4AA71782</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The poster was the seed for further discussions on reflective practice and reflexivity in multilingual research design.

The first concerns the importance of the findings in highlighting the little-discussed area of how researchers might harness their multiple linguistic resources, and those of others, in the research process (from research design, to data generation, analysis, reporting/representation/publishing). Our researcher network project has provided researcher resources, e.g., a website (which includes seminar presentations, related publications, researcher profiles), our own publications (including a special issue of a journal), and doctoral training materials, to develop and enable researchers to be purposeful in their decisions concerning the available multiple language resources. These research outcomes have the potential to ensure researchers are more aware of the complexities and possibilities when there are multiple languages at play in the research site, thus ensuring the representation of voices that might otherwise be marginalised or silenced in research contexts.

The research has also led to further research collaboration Our research team plays a key role in developing further the concept of &amp;quot;researching multilingually&amp;quot; through the AHRC-funded large grant &amp;quot;Researching multilingually at the borders of language, the body, law and the state&amp;quot; (AH/L006936/1). We also continually receive international invitations to present our research and workshops on &amp;quot;researching multilingually&amp;quot; researcher processes and development, e.g., in the UK, Finland, Slovenia, Switzerland, and New Zealand, some of which have led to further research collaborations. This engagement indicates the importance of and need for developing researcher awareness of this neglected area in research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DE628353-C58E-433E-BBDC-B86C18212647</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research is no longer a monolingual endeavour. From our findings we have developed and articulated understandings of how researchers can and do harness their multilingual researcher resources in research sites where multiple languages are present. We have clarified procedures for &amp;quot;researching multilingually&amp;quot;, which we define as the &amp;quot;use of more than one language in the research process and its dissemination&amp;quot; (Holmes et al., 2013, p. 286). Our research has highlighted and responded to a little-discussed area of how researchers use their (multi)linguistic resources in the research process (from research design, to data generation, analysis, reporting and representation), in multiple contexts (research/researcher/researched spaces), and across a wide range of relationships (co-researchers, research participants, supervisors, funders, interested third parties). We have produced publications and pedagogical resources that a) inform and support researchers in developing awareness of the multiple language resources they have available (within themselves, as researchers, and around them), and b) develop their purposefulness when making choices about how to use their linguistic resources when researching in contexts where multiple languages are at play. We have also developed a website which includes the researcher profiles of more than 50 researchers, internationally, who describe their developing &amp;quot;researching multilingually&amp;quot; awareness processes and practices. 

The profiles of the researchers in our researcher network highlight the importance of this under-discussed area of research. There is scope to expand the interdisciplinarity of the research into domains of healthcare, communities and social services policy, business, security and diplomacy, and to explore and understand the potential role of the creative arts in this undertaking. There is also a need for developing awareness in research contexts, e.g., primarily within universities and among research-funding providers, by opening up a dialogue on multilingual processes within supervision and examination, and multilingual representation within researcher reports/theses and publishing. The policies that may prevent or support researching multilingually processes within researcher development institutions also need further scrutiny. 

The research has resulted in an international researcher partnership through the AHRC-funded large grant &amp;quot;Researching multilingually at the borders of language, the body, law and the state&amp;quot; (AH/L006936/1). Within this project our research team play a key role in developing further the concept of &amp;quot;researching multilingually&amp;quot; by exploring the researcher practices across a set of interdisciplinary case studies. We have also developed research collaborations and partnerships internationally through invitations to present our research and deliver practical workshops (e.g., with MOSAIC at the University of Birmingham, the University of Helsinki, the University of Primorska, Slovenia, etc.). The pedagogic resource we developed has been used in doctoral researcher development internationally in summer schools, seminars, at VITAE, and Research Council Doctoral Training Centres (e.g., in the North-east of England). 

Overall, the research has demonstrated the importance for researchers of knowing how to harness their own and others' linguistic resources in the research context, knowledge that is crucial in situations where people, e.g., immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and those in multilingual/multicultural communities, are disempowered, excluded, and silenced by language-and may we add, researcher-policies and practices that neglect the multiple languages at play.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research outcomes will be further explored and interrogated through the large grant project (AH/L006936/1). We plan to a) develop further conceptual and methodological approaches, tools, and methods for researching translation and representation processes and practices (dialogic, mediated, textual, performance) from one language to another in interdisciplinary contexts; b) explore the ethical issues that emerge in data collection and representation (textual, visual, performance) where multiple languages are present; and c) investigate how multimodality (e.g. visual methods, 'storying', performance) complement and facilitate multilingual researcher processes. This research will enable us to develop pedagogic materials delivered through Research Council and other researcher development workshops internationally. 

We plan multiple publications that will impact researcher development and policy vis-&amp;agrave;-vis researching multilingually practices, e.g., in educational institutions, researcher training development contexts, professional organisations, and in contexts of security and movement of peoples across borders.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B4BEA6F9-E70C-48F8-992E-572A74427C80</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://researchingmultilingually.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Acknowledging and making space for multilingual research design and practice: Towards a policy statement (presentation)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8EF1B7B6-136B-4580-A529-7F4EE291BB05</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Researching Multilingually website (www.researchingmultilingully.com) is the virtual home of the Researching Multilingually project.
