Automatic translation has benefitted from increasing amounts of monolingual and translated data, from advancements in core modelling algorithms, and from a growing understanding of how best to integrate automatic translation into large-scale language processing systems. Despite these improvements, even the best SMT output is rarely of human quality. Any casual inspection of MT output will quickly find syntactic and semantic errors that only a machine would make. New modelling techniques, capable of extracting the best possible models from all available data, are needed.

This proposal aims to overcome one of technical barriers to delivering 'human quality' statistical machine translation (SMT): the production of grammatical output. We propose here to use multiple grammars in SMT. One grammar is focused on translation of the source language, as in current practice. The second grammar is focused on production, with the aim of producing fluent and grammatical sentences in the target language. We will develop a decoding framework in which translation and production are closely linked but independent processes driven by these two grammars. Our systems will be based on state-of-the-art syntactic SMT, and our aim will be to dramatically improve the fluency of the translation output, particularly in situations where the original source language text is noisy and difficult to translate fluently.

This work will be of value to UK industry. The UK translation and interpretation market was estimated at EURO 290M - EURO 434M in 2009, and UK localisation and language service providers are strong competitors in the worldwide language industry, forecast to grow to EURO 16B by 2015. Reducing the cost of high-quality translation is a concern for this industry which we will address directly, in that improving target language fluency is a key factor in translation post-editing efficiency. 

In academia, SMT systems are now used to build systems incorporating speech recognition, speech synthesis, and dialogue systems. Researchers at Edinburgh University, Heriot-Watt University, Oxford University, Sheffield University are among universities with groups working on these problems. Our project will enable SMT researchers to apply their expertise in translation grammar induction, large-scale language modelling, and parameterisation to target language production.

Motivated by these needs, our research hypotheses are that: (1) modelling techniques from syntax-based SMT can be used to build stochastic production systems; (2) production quality can be improved using 'Big Data' and machine learning statistical modelling techniques; and (3) target language production systems can be integrated into syntax-based statistical machine translation systems using risk-based decoding procedures, yielding improvements in translation quality, robustness, and fluency. The novelty in this proposal is in: (1) the use of separate grammars for syntax-based statistical machine translation, one grammar for translation and a second for production; (2) coupling them into a risk-based consensus decoding procedure; (3) incorporation of phrase-based production grammars and search procedures; (4) an explicit focus on fluency.

Our research will yield new models and algorithms in the form of open source software and systems. We take the view that the best pathway to economic impact for this type of research is by: publishing research results; releasing software and data under generous Open Source licenses for unconstrained use by industry; and by training students and PDRAs who can take their skills and knowledge from the university to industry. We believe this is the broadest and surest way to enhance the research capacity, knowledge and skills of businesses and organisations. All results of this research project will be distributed in the public domain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our pathways to impact will follow our close links with the UK language technologies industry; with international sponsored research programmes; our participation in the Cambridge Language Sciences Initiative; and our involvement in undergraduate and post-graduate teaching in the Department of Engineering and Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. Our impact activities are: 
1 Publication, Release of Open Source Tools and Data, Participation in International Evaluations
Our main focus is academic impact in the form of traditional peer-reviewed publication. However, the machine translation and natural language processing (NLP) research communities rely heavily on shared experimental infrastructure. Substantial research effort within the field is devoted to: distribution of open source software; creation of common data sets to train and evaluate systems; workshops and short courses for research students; and participation in international competitions evaluated by impartial third-party judges. Publication impact is greatly enhanced when research results are used in a good evaluation system and when the software and data underlying the publication are released with accompanying tutorial documentation. This enables others in the field to quickly replicate and assess the published results. We will participate in all these activities.
2 Involvement of Undergraduates, MPhil Students, and PhD Students in Sponsored Research
- PhD students in the Cambridge Engineering Department and the Computer Laboratory will be offered opportunities to work on the project.
- Students on the Cambridge Advanced Computer Science MPhil are given a project option. We will offer suitably scoped research projects based on topics in this proposal. These will be closely tied to the main themes of this proposal, with suitable resources and a limited agenda so that students can finish successfully within their course
- Cambridge Engineering students are required to do a Fourth Year Project. We will offer projects in Information Engineering to interest students. Projects are scoped for the skills and abilities of students. We offer software engineering projects, e.g. iOS/Android applications for mobile interaction with server-based SMT systems. Research-minded students can undertake projects on specific technologies or translation problems.
3. Cambridge Language Sciences Initiative 
Cambridge Language Sciences was established in mid-2012 as a University-level Strategic Research Initiative. These Initiatives are intended to influence national and international research, policy and funding agendas; to strengthen internal cross-disciplinary research collaborations; and to provide a platform for large-scale funding applications, recruitments and international research partnerships. Human Language Technologies has been named as one of the key Research Themes within the initiative. There are regular seminars, workshops, and discussion groups, which are widely attended, and to which we will contribute research results from this project.
4. Interaction with Industry
We take the view that the best pathway to economic impact for this type of research is by: publishing research results; releasing software and data under generous Open Source licenses for unconstrained use by industry; and by training students and PDRAs who can take their skills and knowledge from the university to industry. All results of this research project will be distributed in the public domain. This is the best way to ensure they can be easily used by industry. We have two additional, specific paths to commercialisation and exploitation of scientific knowledge:
- Close ties to Language Weaver / SDL plc, a UK language technologies and language services provider 
- Cambridge Enterprise Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of the University of Cambridge responsible for the commercialisation of technology arising from University departments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>390378</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Amsterdam</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Research on multilingual multi-modal models</gtr:description><gtr:id>D9465C7A-F62D-4786-A23C-69776DEF4991</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration has so far resulted in a pre-publication on http://arxiv.org as listed above and has further led to a new shared task at the annual Workshop for Machine translation (http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/multimodal-task.html) which will help to promote further interest and activity in this field.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborators have provided the main software for this project as well as the infrastructure to carry out the necessary experiments.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We contributed to this collaboration by providing input in regular meetings and discussions, setting up baseline systems, carrying out analyses of system outputs and revising article drafts.

The MT Marathon took place on 12-17 September 2016 in Prague, Czech Republic, organised by the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (&amp;Uacute;FAL) of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague.

Dr Adri&amp;agrave; de Gispert (RA on this grant) gave an invited keynote lecture titled `Directed MT Research for Commercial Settings' . Dr de Gispert is part-time on this grant, with the remainder of his time spent as Senior Research Scientist, SDL Research, Cambridge, UK. Dr de Gispert spoke about successful strategies for migrating research from academia to industry. 
Abstract: 
Successfully deploying MT systems in commercial settings offers challenging problems not usually encountered in academic research. Customer and use case requirements need to be considered along with general translation quality. When training and optimizing MT systems, factors like decoding speed, memory and disk footprint, usability, robustness, ability to train with relevant data, or training time, are key to success. In this talk I will present recent work done at SDL Research to bring MT to users, and discuss other aspects of doing research in industry</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/mtm16/keynote.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cambridge Conversations in Translation: Translatin and Technology</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8305639D-CD1D-4C8A-BA8E-938C95123A56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Cambridge CENTRE FOR RESEARCH IN THE ARTS, SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (CRASH) is running a year-long programme on Translation.

Overall Aims of the `Conversations in Translation Programme`
In recent decades, the theory and practice of translation has become an increasingly prominent area of academic discussion and debate. Offering important opportunities for interdisciplinary research, this flourishing field inevitably promotes interactions across and within a wide range of different discourses. However, the University of Cambridge currently has no institutional infrastructure devoted to such work, and those interested in translation tend to be confined to informal fragmentary clusters that rarely converge. The Cambridge Conversations in Translation (CCiT) research group seeks to rectify this by providing a forum in which anyone and everyone with an active interest in translation can meet to exchange ideas about this rich and complex subject.

A series of panel discussions and workshops will bring together practitioners and scholars from fields as diverse as literary studies, linguistics, theology, history, music, philosophy, and anthropology to consider and respond to what we anticipate will be provocative insights from our invited speakers. The resulting discussions will encourage an engagement with both practice and theory as they draw on the experiences of professional translators alongside more speculative theoretical frameworks and methodologies.

Translation and Technology (Panel Discussion)

In recent years, the art of translation has witnessed an unprecedented technological revolution. For many people, websites such as Google Translate are rapidly becoming the primary resource for obtaining a rough-and-ready translation of a given source-language text. If a Hungarian rendering of the first sentence of this current paragraph is required, then it can be obtained instantaneously: 'Az elm&amp;uacute;lt &amp;eacute;vekben, a muv&amp;eacute;szet ford&amp;iacute;t&amp;aacute;s tan&amp;uacute;ja technol&amp;oacute;giai forradalmat'. The need for long years of patient tussling with conjugations, declensions, and the mysteries of vowel harmony is (seemingly) eliminated. However, few of the so-called 'na&amp;iuml;ve users' of these online translation systems know how they work. And even if they are dimly aware that some kind of modelling is being deployed, they generally do not know how or why it is applied, or whether a given system is rule-based, example-based, or statistical in nature (Trujillo 2012; Bhattacharyya 2015). Yet in order to evaluate the significance of any such systems, it is important to understand how they are trained, what kinds of bilingual corpora are used, and which particular kinds of linguistic patterns are modelled. There are also important distinctions between the kinds of texts translated. Machine translation systems struggle with poetry, but cope more successfully with certain kinds of genre-specific technical writing.

This discussion panel will explore different aspects of the impact of recent technology on the art and craft of translation. It will assess the professional contexts of use of machine translation systems, and it will offer a chance to reflect upon the overarching anxiety that such systems pose a potential threat to human-produced translations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/26901</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The data set includes two NMT models trained on the English-German WMT'15 parallel data, a German NPLM language model, and an n-best list and translation lattices generated with HiFST for the WMT'15 test set.

The SGNMT tools are being used by students on the MPhil in Machine Learning, Speech, and Language Technology. University of Cambridge. Two MPhil dissertations in in the 2015-16 academic year were done using SGNMT. Marcin Tomczak did a thesis titled `Bachbot` on automatic music generation. He trained sequence-to-sequence neural models to generate scores for Bach chorales, and also implemented constraints on valid compositions using weighted automata (acceptors). SGNMT allowed him to use the neural models to generate scores that obeyed the `grammar' of the musical form. This is a particularly pleasing application of machine translation technology to a completely different problem domain. Jiameng Gao did a thesis titled ` Variable length word encodings for neural translation models.` This is a more straightforward machine translation thesis involving the use of transducers to combine word-level and sub-word-level models.
