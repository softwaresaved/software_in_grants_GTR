This depends on controlling the electronic properties of the material AND on making such material cheaply. In ordinary three-dimensional materials like silicon, control is achieved by introducing impurities into the material (&amp;quot;doping&amp;quot;). It is not possible to dope graphene conventionally without destroying some of the electronic properties that make it so attractive in the first place. An alternative is &amp;quot;transfer doping&amp;quot; where we place certain molecules on top of the graphene sheet and they add or remove electrons without damaging the sheet's superb electrical properties. We will also need to examine the effects of the substrate that the graphene sheet lies on.

In this project we will investigate the electronic structure of graphene on different substrates and with different molecules on top of it. This will be done using a technique called &amp;quot;angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy&amp;quot;, or ARPES, in which we knock electrons out of the graphene using soft X-ray photons and calculate their momentum and energy to build up a complete picture of the electronic structure. However, we will be using advanced ARPES systems at major X-ray facilties in France, Italy and elsewhere which are capable of making these measurements on tiny length scales - less than one micrometre. This will enable us to work out changes in the electronic structure of graphene made in a very cheap and simple way in our lab using the same techniques likely to be employed by the electronics industry. Unlike expensive crystalline substrates, our samples are made on cheap metal foils and are not uniform so we need spatial resolution in the ARPES measurement.

A key part of our project is building up collaborations with theoretical physicists who will be able to help us understand and predict the changes of electronic properties of our cheap, industrially relevant graphene. Such a predictive ability will be a big step forward in bringing graphene to real-world applications in areas such as information technology, advanced detectors and energy efficiency.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Graphene has the long-term potential to revolutionise electronics, with a correspondingly broad base of beneficiaries. How could our work contribute to this wide impact? We see a chain of beneficiaries arising from this project. Initially we will contribute to the understanding of the electronic structure of graphene as it is likely to be mass-produced, on cheap metal foil substrates, and of the effects of transfer doping by adsorption or contamination. This fundamental knowledge will benefit scientists in the field and guide further experimental and theoretical work (see &amp;quot;academic beneficiaries&amp;quot;). We will ensure this impact by dissemination, including organising a follow-up meeting to our successful workshop in Warwick, and direct collaboration development during the project. Subsequently, the knowledge developed will feed into more technologically orientated work - for example, by providing more accurate electrical conduction parameters to engineers designing graphene-based devices. The recently announced Graphene Hub, publicity activities organised through the syncrotron facilities and business engagement partners (Science City, Warwick Ventures), and our own outreach work will all help in ensuring effective knowledge transfer beyond academic materials science. During the project we will continue to contribute to our successful schools outreach programme across the Physics and Chemistry departments (outlined in the impact plan).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>42938</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>DIAMOND Light Source Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Diamond</gtr:department><gtr:description>Nano-ARPES facility at Diamond Light Source</gtr:description><gtr:id>BDC875C7-7A1F-4617-A37F-786CA191FD79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>paper submitted to 2D Materials including data from commissioning beam time.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Experience and expertise in materials and nano-ARPES.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Use experience from our nano-ARPES work on graphene to assist in commissioning of new branch of I05 beamline at Diamond Light Source - Dr. Pavel Dudin.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Strathclyde</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Theoretical collaboration - Dr. Paul Mulheran</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F96993E-0CD1-40A0-9CDB-4B6DDED06EA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper in APL Materials.

We have provided some fundamental insights into the electronic structure of real graphene with surface contamination as well as graphene doped deliberately by atomic adsorption. We are publicising the results at the moment: several invited talks at international conferences and working towards high-impact papers. Subsequent impact will flow from these efforts. We also developed important European connections, notably by winning time at two major facilities (the Elettra and Soleil synchrotrons in Italy and France respectively), invited attendance at EUROCASE conference 2013 (Chantilly, France) and an invited seminar at Technische University Eindhoven (July 2014). Our synchrotron experience has been fed into developments at the I05 beamline at Diamond Light Source.
Furthermore, graphene oxide supports for transmission electron microscopy developed and exploited during this project are now commercially available, fabricated in the UK and developed with the help of a PhD student placement via the Midlands Physics Alliance Graduate School (MPAGS). Finally the microscopy aspect of our work (including many beautiful images) has led to several schools outreach activities, including hands-on microscopy in primary schools and participation in a Smallpeice Trust physics/engineering workshop.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6314D9C6-BF81-44C9-9009-37BC5E7933FF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Graphene is a remarkable material, a honeycomb of carbon atoms just one atomic layer thick. Because it is as thin as any material can be, other atoms and molecules stuck on to it can change its properties drastically. A really critical property is the electrical conduction of graphene. We have shown that the electrical properties of graphene can be controllably altered by adding oxygen or nitrogen atoms to the honeycomb of carbon. We have performed these experiments on graphene fabricated by a cheap and scalable method, so our results are applicable to graphene material presently under investigation for industrial scale applications such as for advanced electronics, sensors and solar power. We were also able to distinguish between the effects of oxygen present on graphene just due to natural exposure to air and oxygen atoms adsorbed on the graphene deliberately. We have developed theoretical collaborations both within Warwick and beyond to further understand graphene growth and electronic structure.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results are important for the many researchers in industry and academia looking to exploit graphene as an electronic material. We have also developed important collaborations with theoretical physicists both in Warwick and externally which are producing on-going new predictions of graphene's properties in the presence of real defects and adsorbates. During this work we also developed a lot of expertise with using graphene oxide (GO) to support nano-sized samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These GO TEM sample supports are now commercially available and manufactured in the UK.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>228365E6-B877-4D6F-A802-7774031B1A6A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.warwick.ac.uk/graphene</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AAD2F5F9-FDC5-453D-9B71-D6D7A4024FF6"><gtr:id>AAD2F5F9-FDC5-453D-9B71-D6D7A4024FF6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Size-dependent mobility of gold nano-clusters during growth on chemically modified graphene</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>APL Materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/45608e8430a6343bffb073dffc6df9f6"><gtr:id>45608e8430a6343bffb073dffc6df9f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bell G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4D6EF766-0278-4492-9E7F-EFA66BAEBCEF"><gtr:id>4D6EF766-0278-4492-9E7F-EFA66BAEBCEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effect of oxygen and nitrogen functionalization on the physical and electronic structure of graphene</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nano Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/633c018bb2b609887a09633910b64780"><gtr:id>633c018bb2b609887a09633910b64780</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marsden A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/81A7BCDD-4489-45D9-B3EE-2D89ABBB63A6"><gtr:id>81A7BCDD-4489-45D9-B3EE-2D89ABBB63A6</gtr:id><gtr:title>van der Waals epitaxy of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride on copper foil: growth, crystallography and electronic band structure</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>2D Materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7df0bc168653e30ae5dbe3eedd03ffae"><gtr:id>7df0bc168653e30ae5dbe3eedd03ffae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wood G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/55E323D7-FB45-4497-9437-4743FA7CD600"><gtr:id>55E323D7-FB45-4497-9437-4743FA7CD600</gtr:id><gtr:title>Weak mismatch epitaxy and structural Feedback in graphene growth on copper foil</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nano Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/43a2ebaa30f1003f8f81713bf1dbb908"><gtr:id>43a2ebaa30f1003f8f81713bf1dbb908</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilson N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C65A6AFE-8623-4A18-BD8D-D5F972C44229"><gtr:id>C65A6AFE-8623-4A18-BD8D-D5F972C44229</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is graphene on copper doped?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>physica status solidi (RRL) - Rapid Research Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/633c018bb2b609887a09633910b64780"><gtr:id>633c018bb2b609887a09633910b64780</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marsden A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K005200/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
