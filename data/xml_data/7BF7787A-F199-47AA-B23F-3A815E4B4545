It is timely because there have been considerable changes over the last decade both in the identification of hearing loss at birth and in the provision of sophisticated hearing aids&amp;nbsp; - cochlear implants and digital sharing aids - that offer the possibility for deaf children to have greater access to spoken language.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These positive changes would be expected to have a significant impact on the development of literacy, both in terms of rates of progress and on the underpinning developmental mechanisms such as use of phonological skills in reading and spelling. In order to understand the impact of these changes, children's performance in a range of reading and spelling tasks will be compared with the performance of deaf children who were assessed ten years ago.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim will be not only to find out whether reading and spelling have significantly improved but also whether the way that deaf children learn to read and write has fundamentally changed. Our research will show what best supports the development of literacy for deaf children.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The findings from this study will have a number of impacts. First, they will add to long-term evaluation of the effectiveness of early diagnosis of hearing loss and the provision of appropriate aiding. For example, if children receive a cochlear implant at an early age are able to develop secure reading and spelling skills as they progress through school, this will contribute to the evidence about the value of cochlear implantation.

Secondly, the findings will provide evidence about the way that young deaf children are learning to read and spell in primary school and, more particularly, about the whether this process has changed as a result of early diagnosis and interventions. This evidence will be invaluable to those who are supporting literacy in the classroom. For example, if deaf children who receive effective early aiding and support show extensive use of phonological coding, this would suggest that a phonics-based approach to reading will be appropriate for them, as it is for the majority of hearing children. If children implanted later and those with conventional hearing aids show less reliance on phonological coding then alternative approaches to reading may be appropriate. The study will also show whether speech-reading ability continues to be an important mediator of reading success for deaf children. If so, this would provide further evidence for the idea of developing speech-reading skills to support reading.

In order to ensure that the findings of this study have an impact in practice, it is essential that they are communicated both to fellow researchers and to teachers of the deaf and language and speech therapists who work with deaf children. We will follow the successful communication strategy used in our previous ERSC-funded project (Harris &amp;amp; Terlektsi, 2011). We will aim for one or more publications in relevant psychology journals (e.g. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education) and one publication that summarises the findings in a less technical way. The best place for the latter kind of report is in the Journal of the British Association of Teachers of the Deaf (BATOD) and/or Deafness and Education International. 

We will also ensure that the findings are widely disseminated in oral presentations to practitioners. We will do this through a presentation at the Ear Foundation twilight lectures. These are made available over the internet as well as to members of the audience and they attract teachers of the deaf, language and speech therapists and members of cochlear implant teams. We will also present the results at one or more cochlear implant conferences hosted by the Ear Foundation and at the next International Conference on the Education of the Deaf to be held in 2015. We will also present key findings and explore their practical significance at INSET days. We have adopted this latter strategy with the findings from the previous ESRC-funded study (Harris &amp;amp; Terlektsi, 2011) where it has proved to be a very effective way of bringing the findings to the attention of teachers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>316487</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop for teachers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E47E67B3-8095-438A-AC14-B1CD8E87D368</gtr:id><gtr:impact>80 teachers of the deaf attended a workshop reporting the latest research on deaf children's literacy.

This was the first study to make a direct comparison of children recruited before and after the widespread availability of cochlear implants and digital hearing aids and the introduction of newborn hearing screening. 

The results showed that better and earlier provision of hearing aids had significantly improved the children's oral language skills and English vocabulary scores had improved by two years. However, contrary to what we had expected, children in the new cohort were not reading better than children in the earlier cohort and analysis of their performance suggested that this was because their phonological skills - knowledge of sounds that make up words - had not improved to the level shown by hearing children of the same age. This finding strongly suggested that many deaf children will continue to require support to develop their phonological skills.

The study also highlighted a particular difficulty in reading comprehension for the deaf children. As a group they made no progress at all in their ability to read and understand a simple passage between the second and third assessments, which took place one year apart when the children were 7 and 8-years-old. This difficulty in understanding reflects that fact that many children with severe-profound hearing loss lack the kind of everyday vocabulary knowledge that hearing children take for granted, such as what a fancy dress party is. The importance of vocabulary knowledge was also highlighted by our analysis of what predicted children's ability to learn to read. For the deaf children, English vocabulary was a very strong predictor of both single word reading and reading comprehension and was a much stronger predictor than for hearing children. The second predictor was speechreading - or lipreading - ability, confirming previous findings that visual information from the movement of the tongue and throat can help deaf children learn about speech sounds. 

Taken together the results of this study show that many deaf children require structured support to develop their literacy skills and they suggest the need for an intervention that will enable classroom teachers to provide this. We have discussed our findings with Professor Amy Lederberg, Principal Investigator at the Center on Literacy and Deafness (CLAD) at Georgia State University. CLAD has received significant US government funding to develop a curriculum for deaf children in first grade to supports the development of their language and literacy skills. The curriculum focuses on developing children's vocabulary, their knowledge of speech sounds and the relationship between sounds and letters. As such, the curriculum includes the skills that our research has identified as crucial for deaf children to master in their early years at primary school. We are currently exploring the feasibility of adapting the curriculum for children in England and running a pilot evaluation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings are of direct relevance to Teachers of the Deaf and Speech and Language Therapists who work with deaf children. The next stage in taking these findings forward is to develop a structured approach to teaching the key skills that we have identified as crucial for learning to read among deaf children who are in the early stages of learning to read. It is important that this is a joint enterprise between education professionals and researchers as any intervention must be easy to implement and incorporate into other classroom activities. The curriculum developed by CLAD could act as a useful starting point, together with the good practice that has already been established in schools for the deaf and specialist resource bases.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>10B66EB4-DDF3-4DFA-B7F5-B762E8368484</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9EC1208F-EB4F-4D50-B609-203CEFAA406F"><gtr:id>9EC1208F-EB4F-4D50-B609-203CEFAA406F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Concurrent and Longitudinal Predictors of Reading for Deaf and Hearing Children in Primary School.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of deaf studies and deaf education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/da255050404c975334359f21f4f0cb44"><gtr:id>da255050404c975334359f21f4f0cb44</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harris M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1081-4159</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9813B75A-0AA6-4812-A50F-6F4C8E9C0882"><gtr:id>9813B75A-0AA6-4812-A50F-6F4C8E9C0882</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies in Language</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/32f4e33b3113f07e220578daccb57f20"><gtr:id>32f4e33b3113f07e220578daccb57f20</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harris, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780190241414</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E1EFE208-BDE4-4819-BAB3-BFD810399520"><gtr:id>E1EFE208-BDE4-4819-BAB3-BFD810399520</gtr:id><gtr:title>Literacy Outcomes for Primary School Children Who Are Deaf and Hard of Hearing: A Cohort Comparison Study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/da255050404c975334359f21f4f0cb44"><gtr:id>da255050404c975334359f21f4f0cb44</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harris M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1092-4388</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/93976B8F-3540-40B5-A3B9-AE9321CD717E"><gtr:id>93976B8F-3540-40B5-A3B9-AE9321CD717E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Impact of New Technologies on the Literacy Attainment of Deaf Children</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Topics in Language Disorders</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/da255050404c975334359f21f4f0cb44"><gtr:id>da255050404c975334359f21f4f0cb44</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harris M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K005251/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
