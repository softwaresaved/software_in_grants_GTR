Biotechnology sector. A direct link to an innovative UK biotechnology company, and a letter of support from a large
pharmaceutical company (Astra Zeneca) are clear indications of this. Ingenza's investment shows that the biotechnology
we are developing is of importance and utility to the UK industrial biotechnology sector. We see the technology as enabling benefit by the production of new pharmaceutical lead molecules for diseases which are hard to treat using small molecule
therapeutics.
How might they benefit from this research? The Industrial Biotechnology sector will benefit from adopting new but de-risked
technology. They will benefit from exchange of people and of ideas. The cell based process for the production of complex
cyclic peptides will give rise to new materials which we will test for bioactivity in a number of disease targeted screens. We
have extant screening collaborations with Merck in the US and academic groups in the UK and Europe. These compounds
can then be developed for commercial application and can be licensed or co-developed by industry.
Cyclic peptides are now recognised to be particularly powerful molecules in modulating protein-protein interactions</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>141116</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>145781</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Follow on Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/M013669/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6C905FF9-F419-4CCD-BF10-CC9A5D66472F</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>142000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>IBIOIC Exemplar</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>NA</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>097FCE2A-AD99-4E73-A26D-998E142ECEC8</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>455000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Scottis Enterprise High Growth Spinout Programme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Scottish Enterprise</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>NA</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B7A47BDA-6C86-4692-8F73-D4BB8FC229E7</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1600000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Innovate UK</gtr:department><gtr:description>IB Catalyst</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of the UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>48487-341231</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>288ACCB0-81A9-4540-8B5D-0C81C81703E3</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The study allowed a very valuable assessment of the more readily achievable as well as the more challenging steps in establishing a recombinant bacterial system to overproduce and diversify mature patellamide-like products using recombinant E.coli. Clear potential of the recombinant E.coli system to produce PatE using a scalable in vivo system was shown for future application, provided that fairly typical molecular biology hurdles can be overcome. Individual key enzymes of PatE maturation were shown to behave very differently when expressed in E.coli. For example, while heterocylase activity upon PatE could clearly be demonstrated in vivo, expression of other targets did not yield soluble enzyme. The study provided very valuable data on the availability of alternate patellamide processing enzymes, such as oxidases and prenylase activities to potentially impact activity and bioavailability of resulting products. It is notable that the new C-prenylases discovered were a direct result from the collaboration established with Prof Sivonen group and Dr Wael Houssen during his 3 months placement funded by SULSA. The study also established a variety of adaptable expression vectors that can be used as a platform for future reconfiguration of individual gene expression, choice and location of regulatory regions, substituted codon bias or introduction of novel patellamide core sequences. The market potential for the patellamide products remains very significant with an ongoing high level of pharma company interest in these anti-tumour compounds.

This project aimed to develop an in vivo platform to increase the level of patellamide-like compounds production using engineered E.coli, to allow access to &amp;gt; 100 mg of material and thus demonstrate that a patellamide production process could be made economical and feasible to meet future manufacturing needs for pharmaceutically relevant patellamides. The native gene cluster that produces both the PatE precursor peptide itself, and the enzymes necessary for PatE processing and maturation, was used as the source of genetic material. Genes of the cluster were cloned and expressed in E.coli and their individual and concerted activities assessed. We aimed to 1) show novel, scalable patellamide production that could overcome yield limitations, 2) demonstrate the ability to introduce gene orthologues to modify patellamide structure using synthetic biology, 3) demonstrate potential to generate libraries of modified cyanobactins incorporating unnatural amino acids. The project aimed to provide a basis to expect that a class of bioactive molecules, of very high interest to the pharmaceutical industry, could serve as viable leads for new drugs, able to be adapted by enzymatic modification and produced using a platform manufacturing method with a cost of goods acceptable to allow progression to clinical evaluation and launch.
Outcome of study 
What did you achieve and is it what you set out to do? If not why? Where are the gaps? What are the deliverables of the study?
Important feasibility demonstrations below, all key deliverables of the project, were achieved during the project.
1. Genes of the Pat cluster were cloned and a series of single and dual cassette expression vectors designed and revised as necessary to express the individual genes and to demonstrate concerted expression of Pat cluster genes.
2. The necessary biological and analytical assays to identify and characterise the products of E.coli engineered with Pat cluster genes were defined and demonstrated. 
3. Unnatural amino acids were successfully introduced to modify the PatE peptide using both an intein based method and modified tRNA/amber codon approach.
4. Successful heterocyclization of the target was demonstrated in vivo.
5. Genes encoding additional enzyme activities (prenylase, thiazoline oxidase) able to modify the structure and potential efficacy of PatE were cloned and expressed in E.coli and the gene products demonstrated to be active. These targets were revised from the original plan which included the isolation of genes encoding Pat transporter proteins. These were considered unnecessary since the PatE protein did not prove to have antimicrobial activity towards E.coli.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project team established a strong basis of synergy from which to continue this work and were accordingly successful in securing a follow on 3 year IB Catalyst award which will complete the establishment of the scalable heterocycles containing cyclic peptide production system as well as demonstrating the potential to extensively diversify the target compounds.
