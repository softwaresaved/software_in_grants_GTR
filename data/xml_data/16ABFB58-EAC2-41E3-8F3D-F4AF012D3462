The application of composites in primary lightweight structures has been steadily growing during the last 20 years, increasing the requirement for new and advanced composites technologies. Recent examples include large civil aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350, high performance cars, such as the McLaren 650S, and civil infrastructure, such as the Mount Pleasant bridge on the M6 motorway. 

FRPs are made of thin layers (plies) of plastic material with embedded high stiffness and strength fibres. The plies are bonded together in a stack by applying heat and pressure in a process known as &amp;quot;curing&amp;quot;. The resulting assembly is the FRP laminate. The main reasons for the increasing usage of FRPs in several engineering fields are the superior in-plane specific stiffness and strength with respect to traditional alloys and the long-term environmental durability due to the absence of corrosion. Another key advantage of FRPs is that they can be tailored to specific design loads via optimising the orientation of the reinforcing fibres across the laminate stack. 

FRPs are, however, prone to delamination, i.e. the progressive dis-bond of the plies through the thickness of the laminate. This is due to the fact that standard FRP laminates have no reinforcement in the through-thickness direction, so the out-of-plane mechanical properties are significantly lower than the in-plane ones. According to the US Air Force, delamination can be held responsible for 60% of structural failures in FRP components in service. Impacts are the main cause of delamination in FRP laminates with energies usually in the order of 20J, sufficient to produce multiple delaminations in FRP plates. A representative scenario for such energy level is that of a 2cm diameter stone impacting a laminate at a speed of 110 km/h. In aerospace impact scenarios can be much more severe. For example, the certification of turbofan engines requires the fan blades to be able to withstand an impact with a bird whose mass is in the order of a few kilograms at speed in excess of 300 km/h, with impact energies of thousands of Joules. 

Introducing through-thickness reinforcement in FRPs is a viable strategy for improving the through-thickness mechanical properties and inhibiting delamination. Z-pinning is a through-thickness reinforcement technique whereby short FRP rods are inserted in the laminate before curing. Z-pinning has been proven to be particularly effective in inhibiting delamination under quasi-static, fatigue loading and low velocity/low energy impact loading. Nonetheless, little is known regarding the performance of Z-pinned laminates withstanding high energy/high speed impacts, whose effects are governed by complex transient phenomena taking place within the bulk FRP laminates and multiple ply interfaces. Overall, these phenomena are commonly denoted as &amp;quot;high strain rate&amp;quot; effects. 

There is some evidence that Z-pinning is beneficial also for high-speed impacts, but this is not conclusive. The current lack of knowledge may be circumvented with overdesign and expensive large-scale structural testing, but this is not a sustainable solution in a medium to long-term scenario. 

This project aims to fill the knowledge gap outlined above, by combining novel experimental characterisation at high deformation rates with new modelling techniques that can be used for the design and certification of impact damage tolerant composite structures. The development of suitable modelling techniques is particularly important for industrial exploitation, since it will reduce the amount of testing required for certification of composite structures, with a significant reduction of costs and shorter lead times to mark</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68836</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The interim findings generated in this project have been disseminated to the industrial consortium supporting the grant, which comprises Rolls-Royce plc, BAE Systems and Hexcel UK. A wide range of experimental data have been generated and now the research is focussed on modelling techniques. Two papers have been submitted to high-impact composites journals and those are currently under reivew. 
So far, it has been demonstrated the the delamination suppression function of through-thickness reinforcement is hindered by high strain rates at all mode-mixities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B3D06B73-1AF1-4E0C-8D69-23EA718CE3D4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through-thickness reinforcement (TTR) consists in the introduction of reinforcing tows orthogonal to the plane of a composite laminates. These tows strongly enhance the fracture toughness of the material, reducing its susceptibility to impact. However, most characterisation and modelling techniques for TTR composites are based on quasi-static loading condition, while the actual in-service scenario involve relatively high speed impacts. Preliminary tests on TTR coupons in split Hopkinsons bars have pointed out that the TTR performance worsen in dynamic regimes. This experimental evidence is novel and it has important implications on the way TTR composite structures are designed and deployed in service. The results gathered so far apply only to the suppression of mode I delamination and a comprehensive experimental campaign is currently carried out to verify whether a similar performance knowckdown arises also in mixed-mode and mode II condtions. Similarly, novel dynamic simulation methods are currently under development to capture the behaviour that has been experimentally observed so far.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The application of TTR in composite structures is key for the certification of impact tolerant aerospace components.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D11CB25D-9C5E-4B62-AE9D-B3CAE55B06D9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4D3B6B29-44F6-49FF-B9D2-521089F0AB84"><gtr:id>4D3B6B29-44F6-49FF-B9D2-521089F0AB84</gtr:id><gtr:title>Micro-mechanical finite element analysis of Z-pins under mixed-mode loading</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/37ad02443c8a13325ab1a72e307dd092"><gtr:id>37ad02443c8a13325ab1a72e307dd092</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M014800/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
