As a consequence molecular dynamics (MD), which originated in the 1950s as a branch of statistical mechanics, has become a key technique in many areas of applied science, including chemistry, physics and biology, and is also an emerging method in many applications in materials science and engineering. MD poses fascinating challenges to mathematicians, since the systems are large, complex, multiscale, and in particular discrete. Systematic research on discrete models is still in its infancy. A Bath team of mathematicians and scientists has identified three problems we would like to understand in great detail: (i) Minimal energy path connecting the minima of a protein energy landscape: Many systems in chemistry and biology can attain several configurations. A change from one configuration to another is a rare but normally important event. How can we calculate the corresponding trajectories in a reliable way? (ii) Dynamic phase transitions: A fascinating new topic are phase transitions in trajectory space, which are motivated by glassy materials. We aim to develop the first steps toward a mathematical theory of such space-time phase transitions. (iii) Multiscale modelling of martensitic phase transitions in NiTi: Many materials and substances are modelled by highly complex energy landscapes. While the first topic aims at understanding trajectories in such a landscape, we also seek to model the landscape for one particular material with data from ab initio calculations. This activity will - foster emerging mathematical research on multiscale problems in physical chemistry in the UK, - explore new scientific areas and prepare the ground for subsequent applications,- and expose users of MD to state-of-the-art mathematical techniques. We envision this activity as a nucleation point for a long-term two-way interaction between scientists and mathematicians. The vision is that mathematical contributions potentially lead to more robust and efficient techniques in MD simulations, while the input from the Sciences serves as a paradigm for complex systems and may stimulate the development of new mathematical tools dealing with complexity. For example, the analysis of DNA dynamics is a challenging test case for mathematical algorithms to compute Hamiltonian trajectories. We aim to apply methods recently developed in Bath to such a test case, namely the protein G (9) which, despite being relatively small (56 residues), nevertheless includes typical secondary structure elements of proteins, one alpha-helix and two beta-strands. We believe that such interdisciplinary interaction will be very fruitful in MD, which will be a dominant technology in this century.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiary is the mathematical community, which can establish closer links with chemists and physicists working in molecular dynamics (MD). MD has become a key technique in many areas of applied science, including chemistry, physics and biology. It is also an emerging method in many applications in materials science and engineering. This wide range of application areas, in conjunction with the fact that the MD systems are large, complex, multiscale, and in particular discrete, makes this area a challenging and fascinating research field for mathematicians. A direct impact will be that the proposed activity fosters systematic research on discrete models, which is still in its infancy, in particular when compared to the great expertise in the UK in the analysis of continuous models in fluid dynamics and continuum mechanics. This grant will help the mathematical community working on MD to form links with leading partners abroad. In addition to leading to results that will be published in international journals, this will increase the visibility of the UK's community in this growing area. More generally, this activity will contribute to current activities which aim to establish a new interface at the mathematics-chemistry community. This interface is far less developed that its counterpart between mathematics and physics or mathematics and biology. There are now increasingly activities at the maths-chemistry interface, for example a thematic year Mathematics and Chemistry at the IMA in Minnesota or a workshop in Oberwolfach in 2008. The proposed activity will strengthen the UK's position in this field. Medium-term benefactors can be physicists, chemists and biologists, since models very similar, sometimes even identical, to the one to be investigated, describe the dynamics of materials or DNA. This field is very suited for mathematics to make contributions; for example, the discussion in the physics community regarding the (non-)existence of travelling waves for the Frenkel-Kontorova lattice could be answered positively for a range of velocities by Kreiner and Zimmer. A long-term benefit might be any sector relying on a precise understanding of the dynamics of atoms and molecules. This includes the pharmaceutical sector, where enormous advantages could be achieved by reducing the number of experiments and trials by a selection principle based on analytic considerations. In material science, exactly this approach has proven to be successful in the case of the identification of new smart materials. Collaborations will form a centerpiece of the proposed activities; see the Section `Communications and engagement' in the impact plan for their impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16187</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We developed an open source code for transition state theory, see http://suttond.github.io/GeometricMD/. This code has been downloaded 240 times in the first week alone. It is an implementation of a theoretical idea developed in this project. The code is now for example used by chemists to find transition paths in phase-transforming materials. 

Computational material scientists in the US now start to employ insights from the thermodynamic scale-briding approach we developed for diffusion for phase field simulations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B588E4FC-A8FD-4C16-B9EB-167D765FF6AF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>One outcome of the research funded by this grant is the analysis of a microscopic model for moving phase boundaries, and an effective description of the ensuing macroscopic behaviour in a nonequilibrium setting. One feature is that the microscopic (atomistic) model is studied with a novel analytic approach that allows us to consider the physically relevant case of a smooth so-called spinodal region (a concave part of the energy landscape between two wells corresponding to different stable phases or variants). 

Another outcome is a novel approach to find transition paths between different paths in a multi-well landscape. Such paths are of interest in chemistry, physics and other disciplines; they can describe the behaviour of one stable configuration into another one. Transition paths are hard to compute, and we developed a numerical method to compute such paths and gave a convergence proof.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>For ferroelectric materials, it has recently become possible to measure the quantities we derive analytically, albeit in a different setting and notably at lower velocities. The combination of mathematical and experimental techniques might lead to a better ability to understand or ultimately design materials with microstructures.

The curve-shortening approach we developed to compute transition paths has been translated into an open-souce code, which has been downloaded thousands of times.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9065330A-130A-4F55-8EF2-0EB17E60040F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0B901A46-67E1-48D2-A439-DA799100AE39"><gtr:id>0B901A46-67E1-48D2-A439-DA799100AE39</gtr:id><gtr:title>Upscaling from particle models to entropic gradient flows</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Mathematical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8989bcac21670a3095ab78eb8215db1f"><gtr:id>8989bcac21670a3095ab78eb8215db1f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dirr N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1587DD9D-C561-46A7-8973-CCB64D9E9944"><gtr:id>1587DD9D-C561-46A7-8973-CCB64D9E9944</gtr:id><gtr:title>On selection criteria for problems with moving inhomogeneities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fd86d64ae2e305f1b164d376c0eb9f3c"><gtr:id>fd86d64ae2e305f1b164d376c0eb9f3c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Herrmann M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AC1B1102-8363-4E88-9CF3-DA841E4043F1"><gtr:id>AC1B1102-8363-4E88-9CF3-DA841E4043F1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Subsonic Phase Transition Waves in Bistable Lattice Models with Small Spinodal Region</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fd86d64ae2e305f1b164d376c0eb9f3c"><gtr:id>fd86d64ae2e305f1b164d376c0eb9f3c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Herrmann M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H05023X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
