DNA has to be copied (replicated) and then divided into two identical halves which separate at cell division into the two daughter cells, ensuring that the daughter cells inherit identical copies of the genome. We want to understand how cells repair DNA breaks that occur during replication and how repair is coordinated with replication.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are dangerous forms of DNA damage. A single unrepaired DSB is can be lethal to a cell and inaccurate repair of a DSB can result in mutations or chromosome rearrangements. Cells are particularly vulnerable to DSBs that occur during replication. The break has to be repaired and replication restarted as it is vital that all of the genome is copied. Restart can be at the expense of an increased error rate leading to mutations and an increase in genome rearrangements. Since such changes can lead to cancer it is vital that copying is coordinated with repair and restarts correctly. 

Essentially all mechanistic models for DSB repair look at a single DSB in a linear molecule, ie it has two ends. In S phase breaks have one end. Here we have set up a system in fission yeast where we can induce a break during replication at a specific place in the genome. This enables us to study the events involved in repair and restart. We use fission yeast to study how DNA repair is coordinated to ensure copying restarts correctly because it is easy and cheap to manipulate and most importantly due to the biology of fission yeast we can induce a specific DNA break during replication. This unique system means that we can study repair and replication restart at a particular site in detail and this cannot be done easily in other systems. Since yeast cells repair and copy their DNA in a similar way to human cells we can use this system to model how human cells repair breaks associated with the copying of the DNA. 

This information will be important and provides opportunities to rationally design novel cancer therapies. The aim of such therapies is to specifically target tumour cells. Since these are actively growing and often defective in DNA damage responses a knowledge of the processes involved in the repair of DNA breaks in S phase will in the long term inform the choice of therapeutic agents.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cells are particularly vulnerable to DNA damage during S phase. In order to study how replication-associated DSBs are repaired we have set up a novel system in fission yeast to study site-specific strand-specific DSB repair in S phase. This system is unique as, unlike the widely-used HO and I-Sce1 endonuclease generated DSBs, it breaks only one sister chromatid and only once. We will use this to define the mechanism of repair of a site-specific one-ended DSB in S phase, either in the absence of an incoming fork or when a converging fork can rescue it to form a two-ended DSB. 

One-ended DSBs can only be repaired by homologous recombination (HR). In mammalian cells non-homologous recombination (NHEJ) is the major pathway for repair but HR is essential for S phase progression. It is assumed that the critical lesion is the one-ended DSB but mammalian cells fire dormant origins of replication in response to problems in S phase and thus in most cases the one-ended break will be rescued by the converging fork. This analysis will test whether the converted two-ended DSB also requires HR. We will define whether a converged fork two-ended DSB can be repaired by NHEJ or whether prior processing of the one-ended DSB commits to HR. We will define the requirements for this processing and for resolution of HR and whether the mechanisms for repair in S phase are similar to those at endonuclease generated DSBs. 

Overall we aim to establish how replication-associated DSBs are repaired, shedding light on the balance of break repair pathways in S-phase and their potential roles in the generation of genome disorders and cancer in humans.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal seeks to understand how replication-associated DSBs are repaired. Beneficiaries will include those with interests in DNA repair and homologous recombination and particularly those interested in repair pathway choice and the integration of metabolic processes within cells. Researchers interested in mechanisms of replication and replication restart will also benefit, given the importance of ensuring the completion of replication. 

This analysis will benefit academics interested in the link between genome stability and human disease. Thus this basic research will inform the wider DNA repair field and provide mechanistic insight into the development of genomic disorders and the accumulation of mutations during carcinogenesis. This will impact on scientists and clinicians with interests in these areas.

Since DNA replication and repair are both important targets for cytotoxic agents this project will contribute to rational design and development of novel anti-cancer drugs and/or combination therapies. Thus, contributing to the health and wellbeing of the nation and benefiting pharmaceutical companies involved in the drug development. 

The skills learnt by the research workers during this project will contribute to their employability in both academia and industry. The UK economy will benefit from the training of a skilled workforce, enhancing international competitiveness in technologically advanced industries. This will contribute to the economic well-being of the nation. Public engagement will contribute to the public understanding of scientific and health care issues and hopefully inspire the next generation of young scientists, again contributing to the generation of a skilled workforce.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>478675</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>school visit Haywards Heath</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>60556B29-56B6-4F60-A1D2-5028EAE6599C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two groups of approximately 25 year 10 pupils attended careers talk, which led to questions and discussion about careers in medical research

This supports the training of a skilled work force. In addition, providing support and research materials to the BBC 'Bang Goes the Theory' production team for a programme on cancer promotes cancer research to a wide audience.

In addition researchers on the project wrote and performed a series of sketches aimed at explaining the science behind cancer to the lay public. This was performed at the 2016 Brighton Science Festival.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6F6421CE-16EF-482A-8E14-DDD9DED774E9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We aimed to establish how replication-associated DSBs are repaired, shedding light on the balance of break repair pathways in S-phase and their potential roles in the generation of genome disorders and cancer in humans.

We set up a novel system in fission yeast which generates a site-specific DSB in S phase and used this to define the mechanism of repair of a site-specific one-ended DSB in S phase, either in the absence of an incoming fork or when a converging fork can rescue it to form a two-ended DSB. As expected one-ended DSBs could only be repaired by homologous recombination (HR). We found that a converged fork two ended DSB was also repaired by HR and that non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) could not substitute suggesting that prior processing of the one-ended DSB commits to HR. We defined the requirements for this processing using MRN (Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1) complex mutants, either null or defective in either endonuclease or exonuclease activities. 

The timing of repair events was analysed by both a molecular analysis of DNA intermediates and by live cell imaging. Breaks generated in S phase were repaired in S and G2 phase. Live cell imaging of Rad52 foci showed repair of a single-ended DSB was slow, with long lived foci. The presence of a converging fork suppressed this showing that repair of the two-ended DSB was more rapid.

We also defined the requirements for the resolution of HR and found that Mus81 was required both at the one-ended DSB and at the two-ended DSB. Unexpectedly, the RecQ helicase, Rqh1, which is required for repair of double strand breaks generated by ionizing radiation, was not required at either DSB suggesting that the mechanisms for repair of converged fork DSBs are different to those at DSBs arising in other ways. 

We went on to develop an assay to detect the consequences of repair and replication restart on genome stability. We found that restated replication was error prone and this was suppressed by the converging fork. 

Together these results suggested that HR-dependent strand invasion events at the one-ended break initiated repair and led to error-prone replication restart. A converging fork does not change the balance of break repair pathways but rather limits the extent of the replication errors and thus is important for the maintenance of genome stability and suppression of cancer.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The assays developed will benefit the yeast research communities and we have contributed to a CSH laboratory manual on working with fission yeast. This will contribute to the training of research scientists. The assays and live cell imaging protocols developed in this project will be applied to address further questions. 

The results, presented at scientific conferences and disseminated via peer reviewed journals, will inform the wider DNA repair and recombination fields and have important implications for our understanding of related pathways in higher eukaryotes. We will use the findings to support further grant applications to investigate the regulation of homologous recombination during S phase.

In the longer term the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of DNA break repair in S phase could potentially have a significant impact on the development of novel therapies tailored specifically to target these important pathway and publication of our results will enable other researchers to access our findings.

Communication of result to the public will help to inspire the next generation of scientists. We will continue to participate in the Brighton Science festival and to promote our work through online and offline sources, including press releases and social media.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A0622B2A-BA06-4593-A533-ACEDBF58910E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EMBO course 2014</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A58E3EE-917C-4066-B164-881F13FF2FCC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Training of research scientists increases their effectiveness in discovery science.
