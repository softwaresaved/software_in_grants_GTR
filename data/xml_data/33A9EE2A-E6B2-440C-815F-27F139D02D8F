We have begun our corpus investigation. This involves collecting corpus resources of written Welsh (e.g. from online language use, like Twitter), developing appropriate computational tools and techniques, and then looking at the distribution of mutation using these resources. We have discovered several things so far from our corpus investigations and speaker elicitation: 

1. Variability in the distribution of soft mutation with prepositions is relatively minimal.
2. Variability in the distribution of soft mutation as a marker of grammatical gender is enormous.
3. Variability in the distribution of soft mutation with foreign place-names is also extensive.

In other words, our preliminary findings (derived from some data types) indicate that the various rules of Welsh soft mutation are sometimes followed by speakers with and sometimes not followed, depending on the linguistic context. This variability could be a sign of ongoing change in the nature of Welsh mutation. 

We will continue to explore corpus and elicitation techniques to further our findings and we will also be collecting experimental data in 2017 to find out more. We have already begun collecting experimental items to construct these studies. This involves finding words and constructions with the appropriate properties. This is challenging for any experimental linguistic investigation, but especially so with an endangered language in a language contact situation, like Welsh in Wales, and has required close collaboration between the Welsh-speaking and non-Welsh-speaking researchers on the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>At this stage it is too early in the project to be able to indicate the applicability of our preliminary findings. However, depending on the ultimate findings we envisage our findings impacting the field of linguistics (teaching and research) in the higher education sector, as well as having potential societal impact beyond academia in e.g. the teaching of Welsh to children and adults in the community, for cultural aspects of Welsh relating to its vitality and its status as a label of Welsh identity, for issues relating to language technology and information technology (e.g. Welsh speech recognition), intervention and therapy relating to speech disorders in Welsh speakers, etc. We will report in more detail and specificity as the project progresses.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3FD7EAB1-3150-4091-8062-F9CCA2C2CDA9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N504324/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
