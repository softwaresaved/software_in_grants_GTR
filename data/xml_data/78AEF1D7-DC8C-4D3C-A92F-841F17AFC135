Cold homes are thought to have a dramatic impact on the population in terms of deaths due to strokes and heart attaches and respiratory conditions, especially for the elderly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project is concerned with quantifying these effects and estimating how they are changed by weather, winter fuel payments to the elderly and fuel prices. The research will examine a variety of datasets but will focus on 1 per cent of the population who can be followed through successive censuses in Scotland and England where we can match their dates of and places of death to weather patterns. There have been sharp decreases and then increases in fuel prices over the period. And there have been changes in the amounts of winter fuel payment and eligibility criteria. Thus we aim to capture the effects of local weather conditions on mortality and show how fuel prices and income variation plays into this. Ultimately we hope to link the statistical modelling to weather forecasts to produce traffic light warnings.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has the potential to contribute significantly to government social policy. We intend to use the analysis to facilitate the simulation of how deaths would be affected by restricting eligibility to the lowest income elderly (passported by the Pension Credit, for example), and restricting eligibility further by age (say, just to those 80+). We aim to complement our survival analysis with QALY estimates to allow policymakers make value for money comparisons of alternative policy ideas.

We could also use the analysis to simulate the impact of cold spells to measure the extent to which residents in each local authority might be affected - which would enable local authorities to mobilise appropriate resources. This would improve the effectiveness of some public services. We anticipate embedding our survival modeling into a website that would provide traffic light mortality risk warnings based on Met Office forecast feeds that LAs and NGOs (and commercial organisations that provide services to the elderly) could use such a monitoring tool. Even relatives and friends may wish to consult such a tool.

The work would be presented at the annual DWP &amp;quot;WPEG&amp;quot; conference (if it still exists in 2013/14) where policymakers and academic researchers meet, at a relevant Age UK conference (formerly Age Concern), a Scottish event, and at an event at Lancaster's &amp;quot;The Work Foundation&amp;quot; in central London where NGOs and policymakers would both be invited. Finally, our work will promote further use of LS/SLS/NILS for public health research by providing the socio-economic background to the geography of mortality (and fertility).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157299</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>iHEA 2014 conference in Dublin</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>94840A93-644A-4A89-9B2A-3E675A025FF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Further feedback on the methodology was useful in fine tuning this work for submission to a learned journal

For example, the iHEA Sydney presentation resulted in a Channel 7 TV interview that focused on an Australian policy programme that is providing roof insulation to many Australian homes. The programme was controversial because several installers died from the effects of heat during installation - something that was attributed to hasty implementation of the programme and blame was attached to the PM. The research suggested that such a programme may nonetheless have saved lives because the hasty implementation might well have brought quicker relief from heat for elderly occupants. Very little is known about heat related mortality - although the Paris heatwave in August 2003 is said to have been responsible for as many as 15,000 premature deaths. The presentation has resulted in an ARC-funded collaboration with Monash researchers on natural disasters, including weather extremes, and health. Australian homes generally have poor insulation but it does have, usually short-lived, extreme temperature spells so it is a useful testbed for these ideas. This Australian research team is unusually well-connected to policymakers and we expect this research project, that starts in January 2016, to get incorporated into policy thinking and disaster planning procedures.

In the UK, the presentation to the WPEG conference resulted in a connection to the Department of Health / Public Health England team responsible for the &amp;quot;Cold weather plan&amp;quot;. Our research quantifies the extent to which the risk of death increases as temperatures fall, and how days at these moderate temperatures are more frequent. This means that the greatest numbers of excess deaths actually occur at these moderate temperatures. This implies that actions to combat morbidity and mortality should be carried out throughout the winter period, and not be focused only on the very coldest days. We have been asked to provide PHE with the detailed estimates from our work to capture the trade-offs in involved and we will be doing this in mid 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C6DEF432-6C72-45F1-BB4F-C2901D391104</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our principal work is based on many months of observations on many many thousands of households and exploits very detailed geographical and temporal patterns of weather variation. Precise imputation of Winter Fuel Payment (WFP) entitlement for each household was possible because our data contained information about every household member. While we do find well determined effects of weather on mortality, independently of season, our results suggest no statistically significant effects of WFP except for the lower educated very old whose mortality is statistically significantly affected by spells of extremely cold weather. But the expected remaining lifespan of affected individuals was likely to have been short in any event. This is reflected in the lower mortality levels that are observed AFTER cold spells for such individuals. Thus, the estimates suggest that the reduction in the loss in life-years associated with WFP is very small.

Our further work that has looked at the effect of WFP on fuel spending using the LCF and found much smaller effects that the one existing paper in the literature - a paper that did not control for weather in their analysis. The small effect on fuel spending is consistent with the limited effect of WFP on mortality. Finally, we have also explored the BHPS data and found that there was a WFP nudge effect on some health conditions and not others. 

In contrast to our very detailed work, the only existing study of the effect of WFP on mortality, by Iparraguirre, Journal of Public Health 2014, is an aggregate time series analysis of only 42 annual observations of &amp;quot;excess winter deaths&amp;quot; which incorporated a WFP variable (=1 after 1999, and 0 otherwise) in the statistical analysis. The most sensible specification in this paper suggests a statistically significant and large (approximately 25%) fall in EWDs on the introduction of WFP. However, it is unclear how we should interpret this estimate because the estimates also suggested that cold per se has no significant effect on EWDs. We found methodological shortcomings in many of the existing research papers concerned more broadly with the relationship between mortality and weather.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We would like to be able to influence the public health profession into taking a more nuanced view of the existing evidence.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B7E9755C-DE3A-465D-A0F5-790858E6A03B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E657FBF0-5E2D-4F4F-B0B4-F57A73DD3E03"><gtr:id>E657FBF0-5E2D-4F4F-B0B4-F57A73DD3E03</gtr:id><gtr:title>NUDGING THE ELDERLY TO STAY ALIVE</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/21e433a9d809a7d1d09b10cd0408fc1a"><gtr:id>21e433a9d809a7d1d09b10cd0408fc1a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Navarro, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E8CB4A68-8ABE-4A36-9EA6-C65CE7B5A00D"><gtr:id>E8CB4A68-8ABE-4A36-9EA6-C65CE7B5A00D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Impact of a Labelled Cash Transfer on Household Spending Patterns on Fuel</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/21e433a9d809a7d1d09b10cd0408fc1a"><gtr:id>21e433a9d809a7d1d09b10cd0408fc1a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Navarro, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K004298/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
