The major driver for the development of these drug resistant infections is the use of antibiotics in humans and animals. Each time an antibiotic is used, a wide variety of bacteria including pathogenic ('bad'), commensal ('good') and environmental bacteria will be killed by the drug, however some of these bacteria will survive because they will have become resistant to the antibiotic used. Bacteria can become resistant either through a random change in their genes (mutation) or by acquiring a new gene(s) from another bacteria (horizontal gene transfer). The ability of bacteria to share antibiotic resistance genes is of considerable concern as it is possible that commensal and environmental bacteria could act as a reservoir of resistance genes that could be acquired by pathogenic bacteria. The more antibiotics that are used, the more likely it is that these resistance genes will become established within a broad range of bacteria and environments. 

Approximately 590 tonnes of antibiotics are used in humans and 420 tonnes in animals in the UK each year. Accurate data regarding use in animals is not available, however poultry and pig farming represent a significant proportion of this use. Whilst the use of antibiotics as growth promoters is banned in the EU, they are still used for group level treatments of farm animals. Our understanding as to how antibiotic use in farm animals relates to the levels of antibiotic resistance genes within different farming systems is very simplistic. We do not know how management decisions on farm impact on the diversity of the commensal and environmental bacteria on the farm and how this relates to the 'quantity' of antibiotic resistance genes in this system. We also do not understand what happens to these resistance genes in the face of different antibiotic treatment protocols, whether some protocols are 'worse' than others at selecting for resistance and whether the levels of resistance genes decay when antibiotic treatment is stopped. We therefore do not have a clear evidence base as to the most effective way to reduce and refine antibiotic use on farms to minimise selecting for antibiotic resistance genes.

The aim of this work is therefore to demonstrate that changes in the diversity of bacteria and 'quantity' of antimicrobial resistance genes within pig faeces and their environment can be measured and related to one another, antibiotic use and management changes on the farm. The application of this work will be to develop a framework with which changes to both management practices and antibiotic use on farms can be proposed that minimise the selection for antibiotic resistance. This will benefit farmers by reducing the likelihood of selecting for resistant bacteria that infect farm animals and society more generally by reducing the likelihood that antibiotic resistant infections in humans will develop as a consequence of antibiotic use in farm animals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work will benefit the following stakeholders as follows:
- Veterinary surgeons: the ability to understand how management practices and the use of antimicrobials on farms impacts on the degree of antimicrobial resistance on a farm will provide livestock veterinary surgeons with a framework that can be used to develop guidance, antibiotic treatment protocols and management practices that ensure the judicious and responsible use of antibiotics. The responsible use of antimicrobials is a professional requirement for all veterinary surgeons as stipulated by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.
- Livestock farmers: guidance as to how to minimise the development of antimicrobial resistance on farms will allow livestock farmers to adhere to management practices that protect public health and demonstrate that it is avoiding practices that could potentially be harmful to human health.
- Members of the public: reducing the selection for antimicrobial resistance in farm animals will reduce the likelihood that drug resistant human infections will develop as a consequence of antimicrobial use in farm animals. This will benefit the wider public by reducing the risk of difficult to treat human illnesses developing due to agricultural practices.
- Early career research scientists: this project proposes two post-doctoral research posts for PhD students at the Roslin Institute and Scottish Rural College. They will benefit from the opportunity to progress their career development in a world leading research environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60633</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Antimicrobial resistance lectures</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C62AE88D-9DB7-4727-AB30-2B6DABFC7DFA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To raise awareness of antimicrobial resistance and its relevance to veterinary practitioners, four short presentations were embedded into lectures in the 4th year veterinary undergraduate Integrated Clinical Course: Farm Animal. These presentations were delivered by the post-doctoral research assistants to a group of approximately 170 students and focussed on the following learning objectives:
? Understand the importance of antimicrobial resistance to animal and human health
? Describe the role of the veterinary surgeon in the stewardship of antimicrobials
? Evaluate the evidence underpinning the impact of antimicrobial use in animals on human health
? Interpret data relating to antimicrobial use at a local and international level
? Appraise assays and technologies for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of antimicrobial resistance

The presentations were distributed across different subject areas within the course, including calf pneumonia, bovine mastitis, farm animal therapeutics and pig medicine. By creating an 'AMR theme' within the course that was delivered by active research scientists, the students were exposed to views and experiences of early careers researchers &amp;quot;at the coal face&amp;quot; of AMR research, in a manner that integrated with their core subject material and tied the relevance of the underlying science into their future clinical practice.

One of eight short answer questions in the end of course assessment exam, asked the students to advise a client with a supermarket contract, how they could reduced antibiotic use in the treatment of calf pneumonia. The answers given by the majority of the cohort demonstrated that they were able to incorporate the principles given to them in these short presentations into the clinical-based scenario of the question.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1100</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Blaxter Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Society of Animal Science (BSAS)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D31CDEE7-D8B2-4A5E-AD29-FA7D95D9B536</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This study involved the recruitment of a commercial pig farm. We worked with an industrial partner to identify and recruit this farm. The entire research group met with the farm owner and their veterinary surgeon to discuss antibiotic resistance and the objectives of the project. The farm owner is particularly active within the politics/lobbying of the pig farming industry. Whilst we are still collecting samples and yet to produce results from this project, our activities in explaining the context and objectives of the project has been one of the factors that has motivated the farm in question to review their antibiotic usage policy. Whilst very cautious and suspicious of our involvement with their farm at the start of the project, the farm owner has become increasingly interested in the results that may result from this study and engaging with the subject of antimicrobial resistance.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>510F10A8-F507-4451-A1F9-4DD1B74A5A6F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N019806/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A502D25A-BB70-4F74-844D-32A2BAD075A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Diseases</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A2A69ED-37ED-4980-91A7-E54B4F6A9BC6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5B73146D-6DEF-4D88-BE83-FE7B9DB21D62</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Microbiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>96F70ACB-D35F-416F-9360-4EFD402DFA6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Soil science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
