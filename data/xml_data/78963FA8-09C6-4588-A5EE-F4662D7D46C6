Fish and reptiles have a simple inner ear, which contains a small number of sensory patches and relatively poor hearing capability. In birds and mammals, the increase in number of sensory patches and the accompanying changes in inner ear architecture have led to the acquisition of ever more specialized vestibular and auditory functions. The formation of the inner ear during embryonic life seems to recapitulate this evolutionary history: most of the sensory patches originate from a common 'prosensory' region by progressive segregation. However the signals that control this segregation and establish the spatial boundaries of sensory domains remain mysterious. The aim of this project is to tackle this question in the chicken and mouse embryonic inner ear, using a combination of functional and 'gene discovery' approaches. We will analyse the character and dynamic behaviour of cells during the formation of the boundaries between sensory and non-sensory domains of the inner ear. We will also use new DNA sequencing technologies to unravel the key genetic programs that underlie sensory patch segregation. Besides providing new insights into the mechanisms of formation and evolution of one of our major sense organs, this work could lead to the identification of new genes critical for ear development and function. This is crucial for improving the diagnosis of hereditary forms of deafness and accelerating the development of the 'next-generation' gene and stem cell therapies for hearing loss.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The emergence and maintenance of sharp boundaries between distinct populations of cells is fundamental for proper tissue morphogenesis and function. The formation of the distinct sensory and the non-sensory regions of the inner ear is one clear example of tissue regionalisation, yet the mechanisms controlling boundary formation in this context are unknown.
Using the embryonic mouse and chicken inner ear as model systems, we have found that a functional antagonism between the Notch signalling pathway and the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor Lmx1a could regulate the formation of sensory patch boundaries. In addition, our preliminary data suggest that Lmx1a modulates cell affinity properties, which is one potential mechanism for cell sorting at tissue boundaries. Our next objectives are 1) to determine how the Notch/Lmx1a antagonism impacts on the dynamic behaviour and plasticity of cells at the interface of sensory and non-sensory domains and 2) to use a combination of fluorescence-activated cell sorting, RNA-Seq profiling and ChIP-Seq analysis to uncover the key transcriptional targets and cellular effectors of Lmx1a in the embryonic inner ear. 
At the end of this project, we will have gained a much deeper and system-level understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tissue boundary formation in the inner ear. Besides filling an important knowledge gap, this work could lead to the identification of new candidate deafness genes and molecular targets that may be used for gene and stem cell therapies for hearing loss. Because Notch signalling and LIM-homeodomain proteins are evolutionary conserved players in boundary formation, what we learn from their interactions in the inner ear could also help to understand their functions during the morphogenesis of other tissues.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries from this research will be the basic and biomedical research communities. This project tackles fundamental biological questions relevant to all of our organs and epithelial cells: how do cells differentiate into various cell types and which mechanisms ensure their proper spatial organisation? The answers to these questions are also particularly important for stem cell and biomedical research. For example, this work could lead to the identification of new candidate genes for genetic forms of deafness, and may uncover some of the key molecular signals that regulate sensory and non-sensory cell differentiation in the inner ear. These signals could in turn be used in vitro to promote the differentiation of stem cells into specific inner ear cell types, or in vivo to induce cellular regeneration following inner ear damage. Both strategies are currently envisioned for the future treatment of deafness and age-related hearing loss, which affect an approximate 250 millions people worldwide. Hence additional beneficiaries of our research include charities that support the development of these 'next-generation cures' for deafness (Action on Hearing Loss, Deafness Research UK), the pharmaceutical industry, and hearing loss sufferers. 
The results of our research will be published in scientific journals with open access policies and presented at international conferences to ensure the widest possible dissemination. The proximity of the UCL Ear Institute with the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital will also facilitate knowledge exchange with medical student and ENT medical staff, which could in turn communicate some of the results of our research to their patients. Finally, the Ear Institute hosts regular events with hearing research charities and their supporters, during which we can directly engage with the public and the beneficiaries of our research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>448736</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Instituto de Medicina Molecular</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Portugal, Portuguese Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration Henrique / transcription factors / reprogramming</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF44D86A-6079-4A94-BC33-DEAC4306451E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One research paper with a major impact in the field (F1000 and Altmetrics= 145), doi 10.1242/dev.119149</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner shared with us unpublished transcriptomics datasets and the visiting PhD student trained other students working on stem cell models, and shared some unpublished cell lines and reagents.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Ear Institute hosted for 5 months a PhD student from D.

Our main findings to date are the following:
- Using an Lmx1a-GFP knock-in mouse model, we found that the ectopic sensory cells developing in Lmx1a-null animals derive from Lmx1a-deficient cells. We also discovered a surprising mosaic expression of Lmx1a at the border of the utricle, one of the vestibular organs. There was no such mosaicism at the border of the auditory organ, suggesting that the sensory/non-sensory tissue boundaries may be regulated differently in the distinct inner ear sensory organs.
- We have optimised protocols for purification and RNA-Seq profiling of GFP-fluorescent cells from the Lmx1a-GFP knock-in mouse. We have almost collected all samples required for the comparison of gene expression profiles of Lmx1a-positive and Lmx1a-negative cells.
- We have overexpressed Lmx1a in the chick inner ear and analysed the resulting changes in gene expression using RNA-Seq. This work, completed in collaboration with the co-investigator Vincent Plagnol has led to the identification of a relatively small number of significantly regulated genes. We have started to analyse the expression of some these genes in the chick inner ear and found so far that 3 of these are expressed in known sites of Lmx1a expression, which suggests that these could be genuine Lmx1a targets. 
- We have developed new methods relying on 'molecular timers' and Cre-mediated recombination to identify and trace over time the early Notch-active cells in the chick inner ear. Using these, we have discovered that the early Notch-active cells that compose the 'prosensory' territories of the otocyst can change character in the course of inner ear development and give rise to non-sensory cells. This led us to propose a new model for the segregation of the inner ear sensory organs, relying on dynamic changes in gene expression and cell character that lead to the formation of non-sensory territories in between adjacent sensory domains. 
These findings have already been presented (poster and oral communications) at national and international conferences (e.g. Association for Research in Otolaryngology meeting, San Diego, USA; Head Group Meeting, London UK) and a manuscript is currently under revision in eLife (Mann ZF, Hector Galvez, David Pedreno, Elena Chrysosotomou, Magdalena Zak, Marie Kang, Elachumee, Nicolas Daudet. Shaping of the inner ear sense organs by antagonistic interactions between Notch signaling and Lmx1a).
- The Research Associate working on this project, Dr Zoe Mann, has secured funding to visit the lab of Matthew Kelley (NIH, USA) to learn techniques for profiling of single cells, which could be particularly useful for future projects aiming at characterising the genetic networks regulating early sensory development in the inner ear.
- Funding from this project has also allowed the lab to engage in collaborative work with other investigators, nationally and internationally (see published outcomes)
- The project has opened up several new lines of research for the lab, ranging from the understanding of the genetic circuits controlling sensory patch formation to the biomechanics and evolution of this process in vertebrates.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The mechanisms of tissue boundary formation in the inner ear are largely unknown. We have uncovered here some of the essential players in the regulatory network controlling this process, but there is plenty left to explore: how does Lmx1a antagonizes adoption of the sensory fate? How do cells retain their lability at the border of sensory organs? What are the biomechanics of tissue boundary formation in the inner ear? We believe our findings, as well as the questions that they raise, could trigger widespread interest in this important field of research. It is also possible that the genes/signals identified in the course of this project could be used in translational research, i.e. to direct stem cells towards an inner ear sensory or non-sensory cell fate, or in gene-based therapies for inner ear disorders.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5E42866B-265A-4E06-99CA-F66F4962A436</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/00E6CB74-0AB9-4A76-92FC-C06F96CECBA0"><gtr:id>00E6CB74-0AB9-4A76-92FC-C06F96CECBA0</gtr:id><gtr:title>TALPID3 controls centrosome and cell polarity and the human ortholog KIAA0586 is mutated in Joubert syndrome (JBTS23).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>eLife</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d4d42c79d976fc7a780ab4ec8339f0d2"><gtr:id>d4d42c79d976fc7a780ab4ec8339f0d2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stephen LA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2050-084X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BC6A13FD-4E67-4FE8-9E0A-C3C638E0AB30"><gtr:id>BC6A13FD-4E67-4FE8-9E0A-C3C638E0AB30</gtr:id><gtr:title>Generation of sensory hair cells by genetic programming with a combination of transcription factors.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Development (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/567c81270095b405c4f77b40c9033bef"><gtr:id>567c81270095b405c4f77b40c9033bef</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Costa A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-1991</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L003163/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9898EFC8-73AB-4E1E-A207-04A486D9F1A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal developmental biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D16FDB98-8CBA-4298-8ACD-955DF734E7F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cells</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73EF98E1-3FA8-46A0-BE46-00AE16C7D999</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Communication &amp; signalling</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CC10CC12-1D16-48BD-8F66-6A64A651DEAB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gene action &amp; regulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
