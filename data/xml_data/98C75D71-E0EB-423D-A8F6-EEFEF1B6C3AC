Problems are often but not exclusively associated with unvarnished, unprotected surfaces. Phenomena increasingly observed include the formation of vulnerable surface 'skins' of medium on paint surfaces, efflorescence, unpredictable water and solvent sensitivity, and alarming incidences of dripping paints several years after the paintings have been completed. The current lack of understanding of the nature of change in modern manufactured oil paints means that the established empirical approach to conservation treatments such as surface cleaning are not applicable to a great number of works. In particular, commonly used systems that rely upon water as a major component cannot be applied to clean modern oil paintings. So far, few alternative methods of treatment have proven effective and as a consequence the presentation of modern oil paintings may be compromised. This project aims at making a significant impact on our understanding of the reasons behind these phenomena by exploring several aspects of paint formulations (oil fraction, pigment-medium interactions, additives) and case study works of art. This will in turn facilitate the modification and development of surface cleaning systems that are more appropriate for use on the increasing numbers of unvarnished oil paintings in international and private collections. New cleaning systems will be trialed on works of art in several internationally significant public collections. This information will be disseminated via web platforms, seminars, conferences and a documentary for the general public and the cleaning systems will be introduced through continuous professional development workshops for practicing conservators, thereby offering practical solutions to conservators facing these difficult challenges.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The key concepts and findings will be transferred to the general public through a documentary film, web forums and press releases, which will help raise awareness of the need to both conserve the physical integrity of paintings while also preserving the historical context of each work of art. The documentary film will be made to share the outcomes of the project, explaining the importance of painting collections which represent recent history in a fast changing European society. The film will show that loss of value of artworks can be avoided via good conservation and collections care practice, while also highlighting the possibility of production of more sustainable products by artists' paint manufacturers.
The research contributes to the sustainability and access to modern art for future generations, and has an impact on the quality of life of the wider public and society. CMOP will essentially generate new, research-based knowledge to promote the sustainable use and management of cultural heritage, by defining best cleaning treatment strategies for modern oil paintings, thus ensuring the preservation of the artist's message for future generations. The outcomes are of value to the interests of researchers, non-academic stakeholders and society, including artists, SMEs, heritage owners, public administrations, industry, research partners and local communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20338</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tate</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Characterising water sensitivity in modern oil paintings</gtr:description><gtr:id>D46CA6CC-2327-4CDD-BAAA-B2C264911A95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Submission of a paper for the preprints for ICOM-CC Copenhagen 2017 - in peer review stage.
