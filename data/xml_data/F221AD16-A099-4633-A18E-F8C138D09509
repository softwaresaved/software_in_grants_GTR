The process starts over again from the beginning if the performance is not deemed satisfactory at the final stage. This project proposes a tool that can cut down development time, improve design and engineering outputs, and assess performance under extreme conditions. By this tool and the know how generated in this project, new and improved textiles for protective clothing will be developed. The technical part of the proposal aims at integrating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) to develop an industrial tool for predicting the diffusion of chemical and/or biological (CB) agents through multilayer, non-homogenous flexible porous materials such as fabrics and whole garments. 2D computational mesh structures, multi-layer textile structures (flat and shaped) and simple garments will be modelled, using governing equations of mass, heat and momentum balance, integrated with human computational representation. The outcome is intended as a tool for product designers, engineers and developers to predict and evaluate performance of CB protective products before production and in a range of conditions, including those difficult to achieve experimentally. Key innovative milestones include a design/engineering tool, and newly develope commercial fabrics and protective clothing. An incremental approach is taken to build the integrated CFD model, starting with governing equations for single flat layers, moving onto multiple flat layers, curved layers, and finally computed clothed humans. 3 main lines of innovation that will assist industry in minimising the 'starting-over' process are anticipated : (a) A model for flat MULTILAYER textile structures to predict the transfer or flow, and concentration distribution of chemicals and biological (CB) agents through the structure. This initial milestone will push forward the boundaries of current state-of-the-art in modelling flow through single homogenous porous layers. Here, we propose to consider the interaction of the multiple layers (typical of PC and PE) and their individual properties, taking into consideration material and structural parameters. With this tool, the optimum layer configuration (how many layers, what type of layer specifications) can be designed. (b) A model for predicting the flow of CB agents through SHAPED or CURVED multilayered textile structures, taking into consideration geometrical and mechanical parameters during the deformation. This intermediate level milestone also pushes the boundaries of R&amp;amp;D by incorporating elements of geometry, mechanics, CFD in a multilayer system. The model is useful for engineering clothing or other flexible materials. (c) Integrating the above with computational representation of CLOTHED humans to assess the movement of air and CB within the immediate microenvironments. This final milestone is the ultimate innovative output: bringing together CFD and CAE to develop an integrated model for the assessment of PC and PE under standard as well as extreme conditions that cannot be reproduced in a laboratory or field conditions.From an industrial point of view, the tools will enable companies to design, engineer and develop PC and PE for optimum performance, with minimal prototyping costs, and enable them to evaluate the designs under extreme conditions prior to production, taking into account real properties of the individual components and their fabric construction. The ability to model the CB flow through the multiple layers will be a powerful tool for companies to optimise the layering system for best performance, comfort and price. The ability to model shaped structures and clothed humans enables innovation in garment and PE design and developement.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>249288</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A1AAEE3F-0624-4F14-A5C0-8C5D0802C96C"><gtr:id>A1AAEE3F-0624-4F14-A5C0-8C5D0802C96C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rheological behavior of polymer solutions during fabric coating</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Applied Polymer Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f76706732cc4158a7609b4aa9382a37e"><gtr:id>f76706732cc4158a7609b4aa9382a37e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhao X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">DT/E011098/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>53F27348-198B-4AEF-A34B-8307067F507C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF2ECBC3-83AC-4763-B527-27A84805F0F9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3DA0C45A-BB41-4C35-A977-05FCC6966C8C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials testing &amp; eng.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
