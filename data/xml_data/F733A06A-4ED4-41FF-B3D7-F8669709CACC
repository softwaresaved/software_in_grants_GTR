The new structure is expected to be highly absorbing to light and facilitate greater device efficiency than presently possible. Successful development will increase the commercialisation prospects for OPV technology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic impact. Research in Solar Energy in the UK is now a well established and vibrant sector with around 37 university research groups involved in total spilt into two sectors: 22 groups on thin film related technologies (SUPERGEN Photovoltaic Materials for the 21st Century) and 25 groups working on excitonic-type solar cells (SUPERGEN Excitonic solar cell consortium). This proposal will have a direct positive impact on the latter group as it is expected to greatly improve the cell efficiency for organic photovoltaic cells putting it in direct competition with conventional thin film technologies. This will inform funding bodies as to where future resources should be focussed. The project will add to the skills and expertise base of this sector and provide it with an additional trained individual.

Economic and societal impact. The economic impact derives from our pressing need to develop sustainable energy supplies for the future. Solar Energy, of all of the renewable sources, provides from a global perspective, the best technology option with some 600TW of energy available (for all types of solar energy) set against future needs of some 30TW. This provides the impetus to develop a strong industrial sector manufacturing solar power technology. The UK is particularly strong in scientific developments in organic electronics and is well placed to develop this aspect of the technology here to an industrial level thereby creating new jobs in manufacturing and new wealth for the UK economy. Adoption of organic photovoltaic's as a mainstream solar energy with its use of printing technologies will also have a strong positive impact on that sector and its associated supply chains for both equipment and chemicals. A viable, highly competitive, in efficiency terms, organic photovoltaic technology will increase the potential to attract R&amp;amp;D investment from outside of the UK, thereby assisting in regeneration of our industrial base as well as enhancing our reputation overseas a for advanced scientific and technological knowledge. We already have G24i and Dyesol within Wales and Glyndwr would be ideally placed to lever further inward investment from overseas. From a societal aspect, a stronger uptake of solar energy will enable us to address the issue of global warming sooner and have a negative impact on air pollution levels. Via the Wrexham Science Festival, the project will bring to the public's attention the imminent arrival of new low cost solar technologies base on organic materials.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>46227</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Microsharp Corporation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Black Hole solar absorber</gtr:description><gtr:id>85DC2514-A118-4DB1-B304-64AA40FBE52F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No actual outputs as of yet.
