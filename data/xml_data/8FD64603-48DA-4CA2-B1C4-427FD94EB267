&lt;p>The study will investigate the patterns of variation within the community, ie, the ways in which Mancunians' speech varies depending on age, gender, social class, neighbourhood, and ethnicity. It will be based on a sample of 132 speakers representing the socio-economic spectrum of the city across different generations and different neighbourhoods, including members of the two largest ethnic minorities in Manchester, South-East Asian and Black Caribbean. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The informants' spontaneous speech will be recorded during interviews lasting one hour. This will be supplemented by the reading of a word list. The recordings will be analysed auditorily and acoustically. The measurements obtained through computer-assisted acoustical analysis will be subjected to a range of multivariate statistical analyses. Their results will help to assess the role of extralinguistic factors, such as ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, neighbourhood, and age, in the creation of the linguistic variation found in Manchester.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82272</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Two presentations to A-level students at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4AB7217E-3534-484D-9A83-5911A147B901</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two presentations by Dr Baranowski, the PI, for A-level English students about variation and change in Manchester's accent at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls.

The social variation and changes in progress discovered in Manchester's dialect through the project have been used to illuminate and illustrate the mechanisms of language change taught to A-level English Language pupils: in a talk by the principal investigator at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls and in another talk for parents and pupils interested in studying linguistics and English Language at the University of Manchester. In addition, the project website, created with a non-academic audience in mind, e.g. secondary school teachers, includes descriptions and illustrations of the local dialect's features that can enhance the teaching of A-level English Language. The website is part Multilingual Manchester, a large-scale initiative and cluster of activities dedicated to the study of language use and societal multilingualism in Manchester based at the University of Manchester.
The cultural impact results from the dissemination of the project's findings regarding changes in the Manchester dialect beyond specialist audiences: in radio interviews about the Manchester accent by a team member and in two public talks about recent changes in the dialect by the principal investigator to members of the local community and students outside of linguistics and English language. Manchester's dialect, despite the city's cultural and economic importance, has been much under-researched. The project's findings may thus enhance the sense of local pride and identity in members of the community.
Another type of non-academic impact is the result of collaboration with Martin Barry Forensic Voice Services, a forensic linguistics consultancy based in Manchester. The acoustic measurements of speech from a sample of speakers representing different generations and socio-economic backgrounds in Manchester has been made available to this forensic laboratory; the data can serve as an empirical baseline for comparing and identifying speakers from the Manchester dialect area in forensic cases investigated by the laboratory.
Raw data with acoustic vowel measurements of Manchester speakers have been shared with the Forensic Linguistics team at the University of York, headed by Professor Paul Foulkes, to be used for teaching purposes in their Forensic Linguistics programme at the University of York.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5106E970-C4F3-4355-A993-13FC361A7E57</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The accent of Manchester measured in terms of the acoustics of its vowels shows variation across different social groups in the community. Some of the variation appears to be stable, i.e. does not change from generation to generation, whereas other vocalic features are undergoing changes, with younger generations sounding different from older ones.
One change in the community that the project has detected is the changing quality of the GOOSE vowel, i.e. the vowel in words such as 'two', 'do', 'move', 'goose', 'food', etc. The vowel is now pronounced with the tongue in the front region of the mouth, indicated by high values of the second formant (F2), by most speakers below the age of 40. For the oldest generations, e.g. speakers in their 60s and older, the vowel is produced in the back region of the mouth, particularly when the preceding consonant is not a /t/ or /d/, that is, in words such as 'move', 'food', 'goose', etc. Age aside, there are no significant social differences in this fronting change in the community, i.e. all social groups are participating in this change at high rates: there is little difference in terms of gender, social class, or ethnicity.
However, there is one particular phonetic environment that does show significant socio-economic differences, i.e. when this vowel is followed by /l/, as in words such as 'pool', 'school', 'fool', etc. While most dialects of English do not show fronting in this environment, the project has found that Manchester is an exception: the dialect shows considerable fronting of this vowel even before /l/. This process is socially stratified in Manchester, with the working classes showing more fronting than the middle classes, and men showing more fronting than women. At the same time, this variation is stable across generations.
Another change detected in the community is the fronting of the GOAT vowel, i.e. the vowel in words such as 'goat', 'soap', 'those', etc. It turns out to be a more recent change in Manchester than the fronting of GOOSE, and it is socially stratified. It is led by women and by upper-middle-class speakers. Working class speakers and ethnic minorities studied in the project, i.e. Pakistani and Black Caribbean speakers, do not seem to be participating in this process at the moment. In terms of its origins, the fronting of GOAT in Manchester appears to be a feature brought into the dialect from outside, most likely from the South.
Another important area of variation in the community detected by the project is the distinction between the NORTH and FORCE vowels, i.e. the vowels in pairs such as 'war-wore', 'for-four', 'horse-hoarse', etc. These vowels, i.e., these pairs, sound identical in most dialects of English today. The project has discovered, however, that the distinction is still quite strong in Manchester, though it is socially stratified. While for middle class speakers the distinction has completely disappeared (with the pairs above sounding identical), it is present in the speech of some working class speakers in Manchester, both in their own perception and in their actual production, as measured acoustically. Interestingly, the part of Manchester where the speaker is from turns out to be an important factor, with speakers from North Manchester showing a significantly greater distinction between the two vowels in comparison with other parts of the city. Such a robust effect of neighbourhood, independent of socio-economic status, has not been reported in previous community studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research outcomes highlight the importance of considering socio-economic status as a factor in language variation and change in English and may thus inform future sociolinguistic studies of other urban communities in the UK. In the Manchester area itself, one interesting research question concerns the geographic extent of Manchester's vocalic features identified in the project and the participation of surrounding dialect areas, e.g. the area between Manchester and Liverpool, in the changes found in Manchester, such as the fronting of GOOSE, the fronting of GOAT, or the NORTH-FORCE merger. In addition, the effect of neighbourhood found in Manchester, independent of social class, needs to be studied further, both for other features of the Manchester accent and in other urban areas of the UK.
Another future research question is whether the social stratification of a number of vocalic features found in Manchester is also found in other urban areas in the UK, for example, whether the fronting of GOAT is generally found to be led by the highest-status social groups in the UK or whether different localities show different social patterning. 
In terms of non-academic impact, the research outcomes of this project may inform the teaching of variation in the English language at A-level, providing illustrations of social differentiation of accents and changes in progress in English in the north of England. They may also inform the study of regional and social dialect features for the purposes of forensic analysis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6716582F-098F-44F7-A4D8-16847834B460</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://mlm.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/resources/manchester-accent-project/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The dataset contains the average F1 and F1 values (in Hz) of the vowel phonemes of 66 speakers from Manchester, representing different genders, ages, social classes, and ethnicities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>599EAE18-CE9C-4A76-BBD1-FFBF9ABA5D60</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The dataset forms the empirical basis for the key findings of the project concerning the social stratification of vocalic features in Manchester English and can form the baseline for comparisons with other dialect areas in the UK.
