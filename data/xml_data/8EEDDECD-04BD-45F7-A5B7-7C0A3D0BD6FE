The historical significance of the camps is beyond doubt. They stood at the heart of Nazi terror, playing a major role in the establishment of the Third Reich, the eradication of resistance, the assault on social outsiders and, most critically, the war against the Jews. And yet, popular understanding of the camps and the Holocaust remains sketchy. These gaps in popular knowledge are caused, in part, by the difficulty of accessing reliable information and documentation. The project will help to address this issue. In collaboration with the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education, it will use new technologies to bring the camps' history to students, educators and the general public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Politicians and other public figures agree that the Holocaust holds an important place in public memory and national culture. In January 2015, the Prime Minister's Holocaust Commission proposed measures to improve knowledge of the Holocaust, by teaching young people about the historical facts and the humanity of the victims. The project website about the Nazi camps will contribute to this endeavor, providing an important digital source of information about the Holocaust and the Third Reich. The website is geared, in the first place, to teachers and students in British secondary schools, helping them to expand their knowledge of the Nazi camps and to assist in lesson planning. Secondly, it will benefit lecturers and students at British universities working on the history of the Third Reich and the Holocaust. Finally, the website will benefit members of the general public - both nationally and internationally - interested in the history of the Nazi camps and the Holocaust. Awareness of the website will be raised in different ways, with details of its launch disseminated via schools, universities, museums, libraries and memorial sites, as well as other websites dedicated to teaching and to the history of the Third Reich.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>53369</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Free educational website: the first major online resource about the Nazi concentration camps</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3AC58DD9-7F85-4CFE-B8DA-09E2C7B2DD84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The activity involved the creation of the first major authoritative online resource about the Nazi concentration camps, featuring original documents, historical surveys, video testimonies, lesson plans and more. The site is free to access, and is directed at teachers and students in British secondary schools, students and lecturers in British and foreign universities, and members of the general public.

User testing of the website, carried out in November 2016 in the Bishop Challoner Catholic Federation of Schools (London), generated an extremely positive response, with pupils agreeing that the new site would help them better understand the Nazi camps.

Since the website went live, we have received similarly positive feedback from university students, teachers (Open University: &amp;quot;a fantastic resource that will be so useful for students&amp;quot;), memorials (US Holocaust Memorial Museum: &amp;quot;deserves the widest possible exposure&amp;quot;) as well as educators (Holocaust Educational Trust: &amp;quot;an excellent resource&amp;quot;). 

Interest from school teachers in the website remains high, as evidence by teachers signing for half-day CPD workshops about the website, to be held later in 2017, as well as an invitation for the PI to present the website at the annual Schools History Project Conference in Leeds (July 2017). Teachers are also using the lesson plans provided on the website, with almost 300 lesson plan downloads so far. 

Internet usage analytics of the website show more than 13,000 page views since launch (21 Nov 2016 - 2 March 2017). While the great majority of users come from the UK, the site is also gaining an international reputation, with 15% of users from the US, 10% from Germany and 7.7% from Australia.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.camps.bbk.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation on &quot;The concentration camp universe&quot;, CPD session for secondary school teachers</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A268954E-6B96-4A25-A251-F1F4588A7AFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Each year, the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education organises a residential course for teachers from 20 secondary schools from across the country, who receive training to improve teaching standards, raise pupil awareness, and strengthen the provision of Holocaust education. As part of the 2016 course, held in October at the Institute of Education (London), the PI gave a one-hour presentation about the Nazi camps and the new project website, followed by a Q&amp;amp;A. In written feedback, all respondents indicated that they would be likely to use the new website, highlighting the provision of documents, maps and video testimonies as particularly useful resources for changing student perceptions about the Holocaust. Most respondents also asked to be involved in the further development of the website.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.camps.bbk.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Raising awareness of new educational website</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BEF64341-95F7-451B-AC76-642A3699F9EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination is key to impact and the project website on the Nazi camps has been promoted energetically to a wide range of audiences.

A half-page ad was placed in &amp;quot;Teaching History&amp;quot;, the leading magazine for UK school teachers, published by the Historical Association.

Information about the website was circulated via newsletters and Twitter, by the UCL Centre for Holocaust Education, Birkbeck College, the Wiener Library, the Pears Institute for the Study of Anti-Semitism, the German History Seminar (Institute of Historical Research), the German History Society, H-Net German, Active History (over 20,000 Twitter followers) and School History.

Following an introductory lecture by the PI about the Nazi camps and the new website, a panel of historians and educators discussed the challenges and future of Holocaust education. 

The panel included: Prof. Sir Richard J. Evans, President of Wolfson College, Cambridge, and former Regius Professor of History; Prof. David Feldman, Director of the Pears Institute for the study of Antisemitism; Tom Haward, Lecturer in History and Holocaust Education, UCL Centre for Holocaust Education, London; Yiftach Meiri, European Department, International School for Holocaust Studies, Yad Vashem, Jerusalem; Prof. Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor in Modern European History at Birkbeck; Dr. Kim W&amp;uuml;nschmann, DAAD Lecturer in Modern European History at Sussex University.

The panel discussion was followed by questions from the audience, about the website, Holocaust education and the history of the Nazi camps. 

The audience for the event numbered almost 200 in Senate House, including about 30% teachers and 30% students. Another 100 or more members of the public followed the event via the internet streaming platform Periscope. A professional recording of the panel discussion has been placed on the project website, and can be downloaded by users. 

The event was part of the Being Human Festival, the UK's only national festival of the humanities, which aims to demonstrate the societal impact of humanities research to non-academic audiences. 

A detailed survey of audience members after the event (carried out via survey monkey) revealed that the great majority of respondents agreed that the event had contributed to their understanding of the value of researching and teaching the Holocaust, with 73.3% of respondents intending to use the new website, and more than 80% recommending it to others.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.camps.bbk.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Although the new website has only been operational for a brief period, it is already seeing significant use, both nationally and internationally.

Further usage will deepen popular understanding, dispel misconceptions and highlight the complexities of the camp system. The public launch of the website, attended by almost 200 people (mostly teachers, students and educators), also contributed to public understanding of the value of researching and teaching the Holocaust (as evidenced by a post-event survey).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C7DCC311-0846-42AF-B87D-DD3CE87E1228</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The award has resulted in the creation of a free online educational resource about the Nazi concentration camps (http://www.camps.bbk.ac.uk). The website includes a general introduction about the history of the Nazi camps, in-depth surveys of specific themes (such as daily life, resistance and liberation), and over 120 original documents (each introduced separately). In addition, the site features over two dozen testimonies by survivors, perpetrators and bystanders (mostly video recordings), as well as documentary films, key data on individual Nazi camps, dozens of images and maps (including an interactive map charting the development of the camp system) and an interactive timeline. The website also includes guidance to further reading, archives and memorials, as well as lesson plans (based on the sources on the website) for use in the classroom. 

This is the first authoritative website about the history of the Nazi camps, bringing together the latest academic research and a vast array of primary source materials. While the camps stood at the centre of Nazi terror, popular understanding remains sketchy. This is true, not least, for young people: Nazi terror is an important topic on the school syllabus, and yet a recent nationwide revealed major gaps in basic student knowledge. This is partly because material on the internet - the primary access point for most seeking information about the camps - is extremely scattered and often unreliable. The new website for the first time offers a reliable resource for students, teachers and members of the general public who want to learn about one of the darkest chapters in modern history.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The website will inform work by pupils, students, educators and scholars, as the material can be used for a wide range of projects on Nazi terror and the Holocaust, from school assignments to academic study and commemoration activities. The website will continue to evolve and expand, with dedicated workshops with school teachers producing additional lesson plans.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4F2519B8-CDF6-476E-8C85-8017838B3212</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N003411/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
