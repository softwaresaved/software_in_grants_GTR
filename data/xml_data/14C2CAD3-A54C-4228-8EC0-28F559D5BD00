Most are probably aware that food chains in aquatic habitats differ from those on the ground. However not all are aware of the details of the complex ecosystems found in lakes, or indeed of the links between the lake and its terrestrial catchment. The problems of pollution in lakes are well known as nutrients from fertilisers can enter the water from agricultural land causing plant life to take over the lake (eutrophication) - this issue is regularly highlighted in the media. However the influx of terrestrial carbon into the lake and subsequent utilisation of this resource in lakes is unexpected. Fish are known to eat aquatic insects and plant life - not many people would name peat bog or soil amongst the food groups of the brown trout! We have shown that such terrestrial material does in fact make it's way into the foodchain and therefore fish diet using a technique known as stable isotope analysis. We have also used radiocarbon - more familiar as a dating method - to clarify the importance of terrestrial material in the diet of fish in Irish lakes. Using radiocarbon, or 14C, we can show that a fish is consuming carbon produced by aquatic plants. This 'within-lake' carbon is partly sourced from weathered limestone and is dissolved in the water. This rock weathered carbon does not contain the 14C radio-isotope and as a result artificially appears to be thousands of years old. Most terrestrial carbon on the other hand is in equilibrium with the earth's atmosphere and contains higher levels of radiocarbon - this carbon is 'modern' and can be distinguished from 'within-lake' carbon. Other carbon stored in peat can be 'old'; this can also be found in lakes and we don't yet know what proportions of 'dead', 'modern' and 'old' carbon are used by plants and animals in lakes. We can separate carbon components dissolved in the water which are used by plants, animals and bacteria in the lake. We can measure the stable isotopes in these carbon components as well as their 14C levels and find out where the terrestrial carbon entering the lake goes. We can also measure the 'radiocarbon age' and stable isotope values of the animals and plants living in the lake can show whether they are consuming 'within-lake' carbon or terrestrial ('modern' or 'old') carbon entering from surrounding land. This research is important as the amount of terrestrial material entering a lake can be affected by climate change and land management practices. The consumption of terrestrial carbon by species in the lake can also be affected by invasive species such as the zebra mussel which voraciously consumes 'within-lake carbon' and is rapidly spreading through Irish and U.K. lakes, causing fish to rely more on terrestrial material. Our proposal to combine the use of stable isotopes with radiocarbon in Queen's University Belfast will investigate this important new field of research to shed light on the complicated food webs in freshwater lakes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>53247</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference organisation, session organised and 2 conference papers.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63CDA12E-E6BD-43A9-B22D-91AFA2436940</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at Inaugural Radiocarbon in the Environment Conference, 2014

Terrestrial inputs to lakes are dependent on several variables, for example land use, climate - increased rainfall, temperature and flooding. Identifying the source and fate of lake carbon is important to understand ecosystem function and possible climate impacts, especially with future climate change.



Terrestrial carbon may be recent or fossil. Knowing the source of carbon entering the lake is important as fossil TC previously stored in soil/peat becomes mobile (e.g. with a flood event, turf cutting, tree clearance) and enters the lake. Recent TC can runoff soil surface (especially during precipitation events) and enter a river/lake instead of being stored in soil. 



The fate of both types of terrestrial carbon within the lake must be determined - are they buried and stored in lake sediments? Or is the carbon emitted to the atmosphere as CO2, a potent Greenhouse Gas (GHG). What impact does TC have on the ecosystem function?



We have used Radiocarbon (14C) and 13C and 15N stable isotope analysis (SIA) to investigate the source of TC in Lower Lough Erne, a complex lake located in the north-west of Ireland. We found both recent and fossil terrestrial carbon enters the lake carbon cycle.



We also used 14C and SIA to identify the proportion of terrestrial and/or within lake carbon (from algal production) utlised by biota (invertebrates, fish) in the lake. Terrestrial carbon is utilised at all levels of the food web; an alternative ecosystem function than one supported only by algal production.



Finally we determined one end fate of terrestrial carbon in the lake by analysing lake sediments. We found that a portion of terrestrial carbon - fossil and recent is stored in lake sediments. 



To summarise, we found that both modern and terrestrial carbon enter Lower Lough Erne from the surrounding catchment. TC is utilised in the food web, infuencing ecosystem function. It is also buried in soil indicating that the lake can store carbon. However we need to analyse (with 14C and SIA) fluxes of gas from the lake to the atmosphere to investigate their source (terrestrial or within lake), and their quantity to identify whether the lake is a carbon source or a carbon sink. The outcomes of this project indicate that 14C in conjunction with SIA will be useful in these future studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Contributing to policies governing land use to manage terrestrial inputs to lakes. 

Attributing the CO2 fluxes from lakes to terrestrial/aquatic sources to augment European and global climate models. 14C can be used for foodweb studies in lakes, augmenting studies using stable isotope analysis alone.

14C can be used to identify the proportion of terrestrial carbon buried in a system and may be used to identify the source of carbon flux to the atmosphere. Terrestrial inputs to freshwater systems are likely to increase with climate change so the fate of carbon in the lake - buried in sediment or emitted to the atmosphere must be determined. 14C can be used in these studies to investigate whether the CO2 buried/fluxed is terrestrial or aquatic.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9A07AA40-9403-414F-A32A-1A02E5EDC0EC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/gap/Staff/ResearchStaff/DrEvelynKeaveney/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6F76ABC1-FE9C-4844-98C8-D486CC055CB4"><gtr:id>6F76ABC1-FE9C-4844-98C8-D486CC055CB4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Young, Old, and Weathered Carbon-Part 1: Using Radiocarbon and Stable Isotopes to Identify Carbon Sources in an Alkaline, Humic Lake</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Radiocarbon</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7cc1296f8ec90c0228e1e992a2684c4b"><gtr:id>7cc1296f8ec90c0228e1e992a2684c4b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Keaveney E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E90BD580-5A99-4586-BEAF-CF92C1156E43"><gtr:id>E90BD580-5A99-4586-BEAF-CF92C1156E43</gtr:id><gtr:title>Young, Old, and Weathered Carbon-Part 2: Using Radiocarbon and Stable Isotopes to Identify Terrestrial Carbon Support of the Food Web in an Alkaline, Humic Lake</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Radiocarbon</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7cc1296f8ec90c0228e1e992a2684c4b"><gtr:id>7cc1296f8ec90c0228e1e992a2684c4b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Keaveney E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/I01666X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62DCC1BF-B512-4BDB-A0C3-02BC17E15F6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biogeochemical Cycles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12C7A68B-3922-4925-9C0B-7FACEC921815</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecosystem Scale Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
