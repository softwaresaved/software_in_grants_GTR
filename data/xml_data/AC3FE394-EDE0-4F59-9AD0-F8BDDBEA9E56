multiple attractors bifurcations</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K001353/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The fundamental question we address is: How can the study of hybrid dynamical systems inform our understanding of human balance? To answer this question we have to know 
what are hybrid systems, and how they can be used in the context of human balance. In simple terms, systems characterised by an interaction of continuous and discrete evolution are termed as hybrid systems. To give an example from everyday life: consider an aircraft whose position during the flight evolves continuously in time. The aircraft is controlled by microprocessors which operate on discrete inputs, and hence the whole system is a hybrid system. Another example, from outside of the field of engineering, is growth and division of biological cells. Growth is a continuous time process but division is a discrete transition. Actually, it is virtually impossible to think of any complex system, that is, a system built from a number of interacting subsystems, that does not have a hybrid characteristic in the sense of a heuristic definition given here. 
An invaluable and a highly successful tool used for dynamical systems investigation is bifurcation analysis. In simple terms, bifurcations give information on stability boundaries of steady states (equilibrium points or periodic motions) as functions of system parameters that may vary; these parameters could be a temperature, pressure or other physical quantity. It turns out that hybrid systems, due to the presence of switches, may exhibit bifurcations (loss of stability) which are solely caused by these switches. An important feature of bifurcations (transitions) which are induced by the presence of switches is that they may lead to an abrupt change of system's behaviour. For instance, an abrupt transition from a stable oscillatory motion to a chaotic motion. It has also been shown that in hybrid systems many stable states, say oscillatory states, may originate from a single one, again due to the presence of switches. Any system operates in continuously changing environmental conditions, and if there is a possibility of different stable motions originating from a single one there are certain parameter values at which the system is highly susceptible to changing its evolution by jumping between its stable states. And if one of these stable states is undesirable, for instance from the point of view of system's performance, this may lead to a catastrophic failure of a system. Clearly, understanding this type of behaviour, that is birth of multiple attractors, is of critical importance for system designers. 
 What is the link between hybrid systems and human balance and how the research on hybrid systems will be used to understand human balance? 
In recent years, mathematical models have been used to gain insight into the problem of maintaining balance in humans during quiet standing. It is usually assumed that, as a first approximation, a human body can be modelled as a single link inverted pendulum where different control feedback laws model neuromuscular response to change in posture which then ensures the upright stance. Recently, it has been pointed out that it is impulsive like muscle movements that control upright stance, and hence it is switch like behaviour that seems to play a crucial role in balance control. By understanding the dynamics of systems with switches, routes to possible failures in their behaviour, we may then use this knowledge, for instance, to understand the mechanisms behind falling in humans.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will generate two outcomes. Firstly, by developing the theory of multiple attractor bifurcations of hybrid systems it will generate a better understanding of hybrid systems. In terms of applications, it is precisely the presence of stable states that are of crucial importance as these are the ones which are observable in conventional experiments and which correspond to the operating states of a device. Understanding when a number of stable states can co-exist in a close proximity, and how these are generated, gives important information for system analysis and system design. The second outcome, coming from the analysis of hybrid models of human balance, will result in a better understanding of human balance and the role played by different physiological subsystems in balance control. 

The most immediate impact of these findings is expected through the application of the developed theory by the control and mechanical engineers in system design and system analysis. Obviously, in the first instance this will be done by collaboration with scientists working in these fields. The PI has a proven track record of working in an interdisciplinary environment. Furthermore, by applying hybrid models to understanding human balance the research will generate an impact on the biomechanics community and change the way in which this community uses mathematical models. The PI is currently collaborating with Ian Loram from an Institute of Research into Human Movement at Manchester Metropolitan University, and the PI is also planning to forge other collaborations with researchers working in biomechanics (e.g. Pietro Morasso from IIT in Genoa, Italy). One could envisaged that the potential impact of these collaboration could lead to understanding the mechanisms of falling in people and possible contribution to the development of treatments for balance disorders. 

Further impact on the society can be envisaged through the application of the developed theory in robotics and through robotics on the development of prosthetic limbs (the PI is currently collaborating with Dr Martin Brown from the University of Manchester and Dr Gustavo Medrano-Cerda from IIT, Italy who work on biped robots).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98906</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Sweden, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Multiple attractors - applications</gtr:description><gtr:id>BFA6866F-FE2A-46DA-B787-AD987A213316</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

In the theoretical aspect of our research we made an important contribution to the bifurcation theory (a theory which describes how a system can undergo a change or lose stability) of switched systems. In particular, we found first two examples of systems (one of relevance to applications in mechanics) where two attractors (stable mode of operations) are born from a single attractor under variations of some parameter in a so-called grazing-sliding bifurcation . The significance of this theoretical finding stems from the fact that the presence of multistability (existence of more than one attractor) in close proximity may lead a system to reaching an undesirable state due to some small perturbation. We also found that the multastability due to the grazing-sliding is sensitive to parameter variation. In other words, the multiple attractors born in the bifurcation undergo other changes to their structure with small parameter variations. These findings open up a number avenues for further investigations such as (i) a theory of sensitivity to parameter perturbations of multiple attractors, and (ii) is there some general way in which multiple stable states can be born in switched systems - a general theory of bifurcations leading to multistability in switched systems. 

The second aspect of the research was focused on applying switched models to understand human neuromuscular control during tasks such as quiet standing. There is experimental evidence that impulsive like muscle movements ensure balance control in healthy humans during quiet standing. In the project we developed an algorithm which allows for the detection of discontinuities (or strong nonlinearities) in data with noise. We tested the algorithm on a number of known model examples with discontinuous events. The algorithm was robust against perturbation by different levels of noise. We then tested the algorithm on experimental data which were the data representing the variations of the centre of mass of human subjects during quiet standing. The presence of discontinuous events suggesting switched impulse neuromuscular control was thus confirmed. However, further tests of the algorithm, on different types of experimental data of neuromuscular control system, are needed to be able to make a statement with regards to the robustness of the algorithm and the validity of the results obtained so far. 

In the project we also used measures from information theory to investigate the time series data obtained experimentally. Our results suggest that it is switched system with Brownian noise with the value of neuromuscular delay of 150 ms which describe the human neuromuscular control during tasks such a quiet standing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>From the application viewpoint future research may extend current work by investigating the complexity of multipoint human limb movement control systems. It is interesting to understand the link and the effects of different time delays and neural noise on mathematical measures of system complexity (such as the ones used in the project - entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis). 

The algorithm for the detection of discontinuous nonlinearities may be used by other groups working in biomechanics and robotics and other areas of engineering where detecting switching events maybe of importance. 

The theoretical aspects tackled in the project open up crucial questions related to classification and sensitivity analysis of nonsmooth bifurcations (mentioned before in key research findings) . These findings will be of interest to the community working on bifurcations in nonsmooth systems, which has been an active area of research for at least twenty years.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>24F6DADB-11EB-4E46-870D-CCDF48512A98</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Electronics,Energy,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical
