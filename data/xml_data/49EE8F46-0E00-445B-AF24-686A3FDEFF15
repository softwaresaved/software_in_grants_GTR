The book as a whole emphasises that cultural life during the Edwardian years was often extraordinarily radical, not least in the domain of literature and literary theory. Yet in the popular imagination, and too often in literary histories, the 'Edwardian' conjures up images of the country house and a lingering on of Victorian formalities, or, conversely, of a prosaic suburbia. Both versions of Edwardiana imply the very antithesis of anything truly 'modern'. Ten years ago, the editors of The Oxford Companion to Edwardian Fiction (Kemp, Mitchell and Trotter) described the period 1900-1914 as 'a period of almost unprecedented literary activity, and at the same time one that has been largely neglected in the current literary-historical record'. This is still true a decade on. Freewomen and Supermen sets out to remedy this, and to show how many of the concepts and forms associated with literary modernism originated in the radicalism and sometimes wild optimism of writers and intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic in the pre-War years. It draws extensively on the radical magazines in the period, many of which have been neglected by scholars of modernism. If successful in my application, I will spend my two periods of leave researching and writing chapter 4 (on sexuality and gender) and chapter 5 (on diet). \n Chapter 4, 'Disembodied bodies: sexual transcendence and aesthetic autonomy', will explore the impact of radical thinking about sex and gender on emergent literary theories in the pre-War years. The outlandish ideas of the Austrian sexologist, Otto Weininger, for example, were canvassed through the pages of the Freewoman, an important magazine for the history of literary modernism. The chapter will ask whether Weininger's notorious claim that 'woman has no share in ontological reality' contributed to the masculinist bias of modernist poetics, and whether there are links between Weininger's belief that only man can be truly disinterested and the growing insistence in modernist aesthetics that art should be disinterested. \nThis chapter will also ask how the theories of an 'intermediate sex' posited in this period impacted on modernist theories about literary impersonality and the androgynous artist. Is a 'high modernist' work such as Woolf's A Room of One's Own (1929), which famously argues for the androgynous writer, still in thrall to these pre-War ideologies? It will consider Dora Marsden's radical dismissal, in the pages of the Freewoman, of 'woman as type', race as type and uranian (i.e. homosexual) as type. The chapter will ask whether there is any common ground between Marsden's argument and 1990s queer theory (a body of theory which argues that people are not reducible to a single facet of their identity). If so, this will reinforce my general argument in the book that the radicalism of the pre-War period has been too easily forgotten. \nChapter 5, 'A meat-free modernism', will ask why so many pre-War writers and intellectuals were obsessed with questions of diet and digestion (many of them were vegetarians, or devotees of the food 'bases' which were being promoted as the key to longevity). Can an understanding of their attitudes towards food illuminate or change our understanding of the ideological roots of literary modernism and of the forms it went on to take? Are the diet-reform movement and literary modernism both ultimately traceable to a fear of mass-culture, and can attitudes towards the masses in the period tell us something about attitudes towards animals and meat-eating, and vice versa? \nBoth chapters I will aim to challenge the conventional distinctions between 'Edwardian' and 'modernist' which have dominated literary histories of the period, and to demonstrate the importance of non-literary concerns such as diet-reform in the development of literary modernism.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18359</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F003668/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>470B20F0-5FD1-4AA6-8809-5E2780CBDB18</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
