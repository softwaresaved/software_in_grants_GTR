AHSV is endemic to the sub-Saharan Africa but there has been the occasional outbreak of the disease in Spain and Portugal which had significant social and economic impact. The virus is spread by biting midges that are found throughout Europe and the UK, increasing the potential risk of an outbreak. This is becoming a greater concern as climate changes influence both the overall populations of these midges and their dispersal. There are current vaccines available for AHSV but they are considered unsafe, causing adverse side effects and have potential for releasing different type of the viruses into the environment. This proposal will develop vaccines that will be highly safe and will protect the animals from infection without the side effects. The new vaccines are only possible due to recent discoveries made by a research team at the LSHTM, and will use technologies, which are not yet available in other public or commercial organizations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>AHSV is an emerging animal pathogen with the potential to cause severe economic impact in the UK and Europe. It is transmitted by biting midges that are also responsible for the transmission and recent emergence of BTV in Europe and the UK. AHSV infection can cause up to 90% death in a na&amp;iuml;ve equine population within one week of infection. Currently, no AHSV vaccines are licensed in UK and Europe and the horse importation from enzootic countries is prohibited. The main objective of this project is to develop safe, replication-deficient AHSV strains and evaluate their efficacy in a mouse model system. Once the best candidate vaccine has been determined, it will be tested on 3-4 horses. Since AHSV derived ssRNAs are infectious, it will be possible to obtain AHSV progeny from T7-derived AHSV ssRNAs. To generate replication-deficient AHSV, deletions in the coding region will be made in an essential without disrupting the untranslated regions, which contains cis-acting transcription/replication signals. To ensure complete restriction of virus growth in normal cells, other targeted mutations will be made in a second essential gene. We will also adapt a cell-free core reconstitution system that allows for rapid assessment of mutated RNA segments to be packaged into the particle prior to rescuing potential vaccine candidates by the RG system. In parallel, cell lines that constitutively express the wild-type protein(s) to complement the mutation(s) will be produced. The defective viruses will be characterised and used to generate virus strains for all serotypes. The efficacy of these virus strains, as single or multserotype (cocktail) vaccines will be undertaken in model mouse system in collaboration with FLI (Germany). The best candidate vaccine will then be tested on a minimal number of horses to minimise any suffering. This proposal will take basic virology from the laboratory to translational science with the development of a safe AHSV vaccine.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The threat of orbivirus emergence within animal population of northern EU and UK had largely been considered to be very low risk. This perception and complacency left governments and the agricultural industry on the back foot after the outbreak and over wintering of BTV-8 in the EU and incursion into the UK in 2008. The BTV-8 outbreak had significant economic and social cost, largely due to the ban of animal export and trade from infected area as well as the indirect cost associated with restrictions of public and animal movement. This is highlighted by the emergence of BTV-8 in 2007 in France, costing $1.4 billion in one year (Tabachnick, et al. 2008). Even though there is strong evidence that the distribution of orbiviruses have changed, the potentially more devastating and closely related AHSV is still considered to be low risk despite using the same insect vectors, and research into the development of a safe AHSV vaccine not prioritized. The horse industry in the UK is estimated to contribute &amp;pound;7 billion in direct economic impact (Allison, Taylor et al. 2009). The increase in horse movement for racing carnivals, sporting events (polo, dressage, etc) and importation of semen and embryos has increased the risk associated with the introduction of exotic viruses. The economic and social costs are significantly different between agricultural and equine industry. The control measures including animal slaughter, vaccination, movement restrictions and vector control methods are well understood for most agriculturally important disease whereas outbreaks of equine diseases have a degree of extra complexity, as animal slaughter would be unacceptable and restriction in horse movement could potentially have a more serious impact on the industries than the disease itself. The economic impact of an AHSV outbreak is expected to be ~ &amp;pound;4 billion if it remains uncontrolled (Allison, et al. 2009) and furthermore, failure to control and limit an AHSV outbreak in the UK would causehe collapse of the British racing industry within 18 months (Allison, Taylor et al. 2009). A worst-case scenario is the rapid spread of the virus once introduced, by wind-borne dispersal of midges into a susceptible na&amp;iuml;ve horse population (&amp;gt;1.3 million) in which 75-95% could die. A similar case fatality for AHSV has been documented for the 1959 epidemic, with more than 300,000 horses died due to AHSV infection (House 1993; Mellor and Hamblin 2004). In the past, whilst vaccination was used to control and eradicate AHSV in Spain and Iberian Peninsula outbreak, currently there are no AHSV vaccines licensed in UK or EU to prevent its spread and minimize economic impact due to safety issues associated with the current vaccines. The development of an AHSV vaccine that is safe, efficacious and affords protection would have a major impact in preparing the UK and EU for any potential outbreak.

Nine different serotypes have been described so far. AHSV is vectored by Culicoides spp. to equids, causing diseases with a high mortality rate and dissemination potential thus engendering considerable economic impacts. For development of a safe attenuated vaccine, we previously established a highly efficient reverse genetics (RG) system to generate replication-deficient virus strains for all nine serotypes and demonstrated the vaccine potential of these strains in type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)-knockout mice (1). Here, we evaluated the protective efficacies of these replication-deficient viruses in AHSV natural hosts, e.g. ponies. One monoserotype (def-AHSV4) vaccine and one multivalent cocktail (def-AHSV1/4/6/8) vaccine were tested and ponies were challenged with a virulent AHSV4. All vaccinated ponies were completely protected from virulent homologous virus challenge and did not develop AHSV clinical symptoms. Furthermore, the cocktail def-AHSV vaccinated ponies produced neutralizing antibodies against all serotypes present in the cocktail, and a foal born during the trial was healthy and had no viremia. These results validate the suitability of these deficient strains as a new generation of vaccines for AHSV.

IMPORTANCE
African horse sickness virus is one of the most devastating diseases of horses. Since AHSV is closely related to bluetongue virus that recently emerged in Northern Europe and also both are transmitted by the same culicoides vector, AHSV could be expected to emerge outside of its usual geographic boundaries in Africa. The live virus vaccines that are currently used can lead to sufficient viremia for uptake and spreading by insect vectors, reversion to virulence and reassortments. Thus, it is essential to develop highly efficacious vaccines for all AHSV serotypes and such vaccines must be completely safe in horses, generating no viremia. To this end, we generated replication-deficient AHSV variants and assessed their protective efficacy in ponies. Vaccinated animals were completely protected against virulent virus challenge demonstrating the suitability of these deficient viruses as vaccines in animals.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E5201BB-57D6-4D8C-A150-2B7341FE0C5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>African horse sickness virus (AHSV), an orbivirus in the Reoviridae family with nine different serotypes, causes devastating disease in equids. The virion particle is composed of seven proteins organized in three concentric layers, an outer layer made of VP2 and VP5, a middle layer made of VP7, and inner layer made of VP3 that encloses a replicase complex of VP1, VP4, and VP6 and a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA segments. In this study, we sought to develop highly efficacious candidate vaccines against all AHSV serotypes, taking into account not only immunogenic and safety properties but also virus productivity and stability parameters, which are essential criteria for vaccine candidates. To achieve this goal, we first established a highly efficient reverse genetics (RG) system for AHSV serotype 1 (AHSV1) and, subsequently, a VP6-defective AHSV1 strain in combination with in trans complementation of VP6. This was then used to generate defective particles of all nine serotypes, which required the exchange of two to five RNA segments to achieve equivalent titers of particles. All reassortant-defective viruses could be amplified and propagated to high titers in cells complemented with VP6 but were totally incompetent in any other cells. Furthermore, these replication-incompetent AHSV particles were demonstrated to be highly protective against homologous virulent virus challenges in type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)-knockout mice. Thus, these defective viruses have the potential to be used for the development of safe and stable vaccine candidates. The RG system also provides a powerful tool for the study of the role of individual AHSV proteins in virus assembly, morphogenesis, and pathogenesis.
IMPORTANCE:
African horse sickness virus is transmitted by biting midges and causes African horse sickness in equids, with mortality reaching up to 95% in naive horses. Therefore, the development of efficient vaccines is extremely important due to major economic losses in the equine industry. Through the establishment of a highly efficient RG system, replication-deficient viruses of all nine AHSV serotypes were generated. These defective viruses achieved high titers in a cell line complemented with VP6 but failed to propagate in wild-type mammalian or insect cells. Importantly, these candidate vaccine strains showed strong protective efficacy against AHSV infection in an IFNAR(-/-) mouse model.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Designing attenuated AHSV vaccines (2016)</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2016</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have constructed the vaccine strains for all AHSV strains.
