This unique ability means that they have great potential for treating several serious diseases, the current treatments for which are often incomplete, transitory or even non-existent. These include diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease all of which result from cell degeneration or malfunction due to age, infection or injury. However two major obstacles in the development of such ES cell-based treatments are that we still have at best a fragmentary understanding of firstly how to obtain adequate numbers of undifferentiated ES cells and maintain them in tissue culture, and secondly how to control their differentiation in order to produce specific cell types. ES cells are derived from either a single cell or the very small numbers of cells present in the preimplantation embryo, meaning that their numbers have to be amplified in tissue culture in order to produce the amounts that will be necessary for clinical use. This gives rise to the first obstacle because in order to do this, the ES cells currently have to be cultured in the presence of other cell types or animal products. These additions to the culture environment expose the cells to potentially harmful viruses or other infectious agents which could be transferred not only to the patients but also others with whom they come into contact. The second obstacle of not fully understanding how to control the differentiation of ES cells also arises because we know little about the factors supplied by the feeder cells. The aim of this project is therefore to eliminate the need for exposure to other cell types and their undefined products in order to develop a method that will both produce large numbers of uncontaminated ES cells suitable for clinical use and will also allow us to determine the mechanisms that control the differentiation of the ES cells. Work by ourselves and others has shown that one of the crucial factors influencing the behaviour of ES cells in the tissue culture environment is their contact with each other and with the substrate on which the cells grow. We are able to modify the surface properties of materials in controlled ways to produce substrates with specific chemistries and nanotopographies (surface architecture on a scale less than one millionth of a meter), and have shown that not only the chemical composition but also the surface architecture of the substrates does indeed affect cell behaviour. We hypothesise that ES cells can be propagated on synthetic substrates that are designed to control interactions with the cells and thus remove the need for animal products in the culture medium. In the project we will study the surface properties of these materials in detail and evaluate the behaviour of ES cells cultured on them in order to select a set of substrates that show potential to control the behaviour of ES cells. We will then thoroughly investigate the surface chemistry and topography of the substrates and the behaviour of the ES cells exposed to them so that we can design specific surfaces to optimize the ES cell response. This will also allow us to build up an understanding of the mechanism regulating ES cell growth and the mechanisms by which the substrate surface properties control their growth. Such information will facilitate the future production of ES cells suitable for clinical use.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The overall aim of this project is to develop synthetic polymers with controlled surface chemistry and topography both to provide substrates that will facilitate ES cell propagation under GMP conditions (Good Manufacturing Practice) and to permit analysis of the intracellular mechanism that control ES cell self-renewal. The project comprises three complementary activities: substrate synthesis and screening, physical analysis of substrates, and analysis of the cellular consequences of substrate interactions. 1. Substrate synthesis and screening. Following preliminary selection of substrates assayed exclusively with mES cells in order to discard inappropriate (toxic or nonadhesive) candidates, we will screen the effectiveness of designer substrates on both mouse and human ES cell culture systems throughout the project in order that we do not miss species-specific substrates. Screening and substrate development will be an iterative process of increasing structural refinement informed by structural analysis and assays of stem cell pluripotency with increasing stringency. Thus, initial simple assays of ES cell self renewal on candidate substrates and physico-chemical analyses will be used to refine substrate design for subsequent rounds of screening using more stringent criteria, optimized substrates being tested for their ability to support ES cell derivation, long-term culture and maintenance of pluripotentiality. Modifications of substrate chemistry (using simple gas plasmas and proprietary acrylic based coating technology) and topography (using nano particles and nano fibres) will be performed to develop the optimal synthetic substrates that may be applied for subsequent use in the development of GMP conditions for the derivation and maintenance of undifferentiated human ES cells. 2. Physico-chemical analysis of substrates Elucidation of the fine details of the physico-chemical substrate properties that regulate ES cell behaviour is necessary (a) to aid the systematic modifications (tailoring) of substrate candidates to optimize their biological activities and (b) to determine the molecular mechanisms whereby substrates regulate that behaviour. State of the art electron spectroscopy will be used to obtain a fundamental understanding of the local electronic structure and surface functional groups, which in combination with wettability and topography analyses, will determine the requirements for this behaviour. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy will be used for surface chemical analysis of plasma treated surfaces and scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy will be used to obtain high resolution images of the surfaces. 3. Cell biological analyses We will determine the effect of substrate chemistry and topography on the adhesion, cytoarchitecture and cell signalling pathways involved in ES cell self-renewal. In particular the effect of substrates on pathways known to regulate both mES and hES self-renewal will be investigated in order to elucidate the mechanisms fundamental to ES cells in general. Thus, the role of Wnt signalling will be investigated to determine if the main function beta-catenin in self-renewal is to induce transcription of target genes or promote cell-cell adhesion. The activation and localisation of cYes, (also essential for both human and mouse ES cell self-renewal) will be characterised, and we will determine if the requirement for cYes can be obviated if ES cells are grown on permissive substrates. The role of Rho GTPases in mediating these effects will then be investigated, and we will determine if permissive substrates and LIF regulate the same set of Rho GTPases in mouse ES cells. When combined with detailed physico-chemical analysis of the synthetic substrates this will delineate mechanisms by which cell/substrate interactions regulate ES cell self-renewal.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>257610</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Don Whitley Scientific Limited</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Don Whitley Scientific</gtr:description><gtr:id>1C27999F-4BF3-490B-AB2A-5723F1FB7BAA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>innovate grant...will put in for CIC and pos P2D</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>DWS have a work staion whihc h they will upgrade a redesign for controlled atmosphere working.

At the onset of the grant in April 2006 the research community still lacked any reliable and efficient feeder-free culture medium for growth of undifferentiated pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESc) in the long term. Therefore our first aim was to develop such a culture system which would allow us to test substrates for compatibility with hESc growth and self renewal. We tried other published media (e.g. Valier et al 2005J Cell Sci 118,4495) using a number of substrates ( Matrigel, Laminin Fibronectin etc) but found that reported feeder cell- and serum-free culture systems used by others for other hESc lines were unable to maintain HUES7 cells for more than one passage. Therefore we set out to develop media based on a number of then recent reports (Xu et al 2005 Stem cells 23,315; James et al 2005 Devel 132, 1273). Empirically and with reference to further papers (Yao et al 2006 PNAS 103, 6907; Pyle et al 2006 Nat Biotech 24,344; Liu et al 2006 BBRC 346,131) we subsequently developed a new feeder- free system which has proved extremely successful in long term defined culture for 9 hESc lines to date (without the usual conditioned medium) and allows defined experimentation (Baxter et al 2009). Our initial work confirmed that the LIF-stat-3 signalling pathway is not active in pluripotent hESc and that LIF is not needed for their culture, on or off feeder cells, or for their derivation (8 lines derived to date: Caramasa et al 2010 J In Vitro Lab Sci E-pub; De Sousa et al 2009 Stem Cell Research 2, 188 and unpub). 



Dissecting the requirement for culture components

The role of individual supplements necessary for the self-renewal of hESc is poorly characterized. We were able to validate our culture system and dissect the role of the different components in the medium, showing that all three added growth factors played important roles in hESc maintenance (See Baxter et al 2009 for detailed results). We therefore developed a feeder and serum free defined culture system that can support the long-term (at least 10 passages) self-renewal of several euploid hESc lines including MAN1, HUES7 and HUES1 with minimal spontaneous differentiation and without the need for manual propagation. This system contains fibroblast growth factor 2, activin A, neurotrophin 4 (NT4) and the N2 and B27 commercial supplements together with a human fibronectin substrate. We demonstrated that these components exert distinct functions: both FGF2 and Activin A are necessary to retain pluripotency and prevent differentiation of hESc while NT4 promoted cell survival. FGF-2 played an important part in self renewal. However removal of both Activin and NT4 has a greater effect on pluripotency than removal of Activin alone. In contrast to other reports (Bendall et al 2007 Nature 448,1015), in our system FGF2 could not be substituted by IGFII. IGFII supported a lower level of proliferation and cells lost expression of the pluripotency markers in the long term. Subsequent to publication we have further refined the culture system simplifying it with the removal of the N2 supplement (5ug/ml insulin,100ug/ml transferring, 6.3ng/ml progesterone,16ug/ml putrescine, 5.2 ng/ml selenite) and reducing the levels of FGF-2 and NT-4 required. Fibronectin supported a rapid rate of hESc culture expansion and was superior to the other natural substrates that we tried (Laminin reported in Baxter et al 2009 and Vitronectin, Collagen VI, Perlecan, Tenascin and Fibulin 1 combinations, (Iskender, Soteriou Baxter Grady Kimber manuscript in preparation) as well as synthetic substrates. We have also tested our hESc medium against more recently available commercial compositions such as mTESr (Stem Cell Technologies) and have found it at least as efficient in hESc maintenance and under some conditions better. Indeed we are in talks with a company (see below) who wish to market the medium under licence.
We published the key extracellualr matrix moleculeds produced by supportive feeder cells and hESCs (Soteriou et al 2013). We have another paper reporting the key role of FAK and integrin B1 in regulation of aproptosis and hESC differentiaion which we hope to resubmit once we have answered referees commnets in next month.

Generation of induced Pluripotent Stem cells 



We attempted generation of iPS cells form blood monocytes without success . Only in 2011 have successful protocols been established for these cells which are more difficult to reprogram than epithelial or fibroblastic cell types. Human dermal fibroblasts (primary cells) were successfully reprogrammed. GMP quality adult primary Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDF) were procured from Intercytex, Manchester. Lentiviral vectors expressing human cDNA for OCT4 and SOX2 were acquired from the Addgene repository as were expression plasmids for human KLF4 and C-MYC transgenes. These were both subsequently cloned into the same lentiviral backbones as OCT4 and SOX2 . Lentiviral preps were generated and used to individually transduce first 293T cells and then HDFs which were analysed for transgene expression by RT-PCR . P1 cultures of adult HDFs were transduced with equal volumes of all 4 factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC) then plated onto mitotically inactivated MEFs 72 hours later. Cells were cultured in standard Embryonic Stem cell medium for 21 days when ES-like colonies started to appear. This experiment was paralleled with an experiment including application of an extra vectors expressing hTERT. In total, 4 colonies appeared and persisted beyond P1 (Fig. 3.). Colonies were grown to a size where they could be mechanically passaged and were re-plated onto fresh MEFs. Colonies were mechanically passaged for to at least P3 before attempting to culture under feeder-free conditions. New iPS cell lines were initially assessed using qPCR and immunohistochemistry. In a comparison of transcript versus cDNA, within 17 days of culture endogenous transcripts of OCT4 and SOX2 had risen from undetectable to 50-90% that of total transcript including transgene. This is clearly indicative of successful reprogramming toward pluripotency . Furthermore, all iPS cell lines showed clear expression of the pluripotency markers SSEA3 and 4 and sporadic expression of SSEA1 a marker of early differentiation. Finally, we generated an iPS cell line transduced with a lentivirus expressing GFP under the control of the human OCT4 promoter. These cells expressed GFP when grown under ES cell maintenance conditions.





Under our defined conditions hESc express all the machinery for integrin signalling e.g. integrins, vinculin paxillin Rho A and Focal Adhesion kinase and the levels of these components do not change as the cells proceed from rounded adherent hESc to differentiating cell types under the influence of serum (Baxter et al in prep). We have shown that these components are diffusely cytoplasmic or for _1 integrin, including active _1 integrin, located at both lateral and basal membranes in hESc, while on loss of Nanog, and differentiation they rapidly rearrange into focal adhesions. Inhibition studies showed that _1 integrin-dependent attachment of hESc to fibronectin was mainly via the _5 subunit but independent of integrin _V (Baxter et al 2009). Focal Adhesion Kinase (Fak) is a key molecule in transmission of the signals from integrin engagement. Active Fak is present in hESc as well as their differentiated derivatives (Baxter et al in prep) and we are finalising experiments to determine its roll in hESc. We examined the role of integrins more closely by using blocking and activating antibodies to integrin _1. We reasoned that activation of _1 might induce focal adhesion formation since it has been shown to do so in other cultured cells. Treatment with _1 activating antibody did not induce focal adhesions in hESc but rather interfered with integrin-fibronectin adhesion since after 1 h exposure, all hESc had detached and after 1 day had formed cell-clusters (not seen in isotype controls). To determine if this was a consequence of the activation of integrin, hESc cultures were then treated with a non-activating _1 antibody which blocks integrin engagement. This treatment caused hESc detachment after 1 hour and after 1 day hESc had again formed cell-clusters. To determine whether blocking _1 integrin induced a loss of pluripotency, Nanog expression was quantified by Q-PCR in hESc cultures treated with either MAB13 or isotype control for 1 and 3 days. Nanog expression significantly decreased over 3 days when hESc were cultured with MAB13 compared to the isotype control, indicating that blocking integrin-fibronectin interaction induced loss of pluripotency. 



An inhibitor of Rho associated kinase (Rock), a mediator of Rho - integrin signalling, has been demonstrated in several labs to increase hESc survival. We confirmed this and showed that there is a significant increase in both number and size of hESc colonies in the presence of Rock inhibitor. Rho A is upstream of Rock and we hypothesised that low levels of RhoA activity in hESc might normally result in low Rock activity and self renewal while RhoA activity would increase on differentiation. However, active Rho GTP levels were higher in hESc than in their differentiated progeny, but hESc do not exhibit focal adhesions. We therefore asked if enforcing integrin and associated components into focal adhesions through the RhoA activator Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), commonly used to induce focal adhesion formation, would induce hESc differentiation. LPA, treatment triggered a dramatic down regulation of Nanog within a matter of hours and a parallel reorganisation of the diffuse cortical actin in hESc to a stress fibre-like pattern. This suggests that excessive/increased Rho A activity with formation of focal adhesions induces differentiation. We therefore asked if active Rho A is important for induction of differentiation of hESc. We inhibited Rho A with C3 transferase and after 24 h, cells still retained Nanog expression and other markers of pluripotency but rapidly lost tight cell-cell association. We therefore examined the influence of C3 transferase on E-cadherin expression. Immunostaining showed a complete dispersion of E-cadherin junctions after only 30 minutes exposure to C3 transferase. Thus inhibiting Rho A may change cell association without affecting pluripotency in the short term. The critical role of RhoA means that longer term experiments were not feasible. We have also shown novel data indicating the critical role of Fak in hESC and hiPSC maintenance and cell survival as well as cell adhesion (Vitillo et al 2016). This is in contrast to previous evidence for its role in PSC differentiation







Training 

The post doctoral scientist was trained in all aspects of hESc culture and characterisation as well as new techniques in biochemical analysis and molecular manipulation of stem cells with lentivirus. She has also learned some chemical synthesis and utilisation of substrates in association with the Material Scientists in Liverpool. She was exposed to informal in house training about Good Manufacturing Practice and aspects of therapeutic hESc use. She also attended the BBSRC/BBC work shop on interacting with the media in 2008. The technician (part time) has also been trained in all aspects of feeder cell derivation and maintenance, stem cell culture, stem cell characterisation, biochemical analysis especially western blotting, viral transformation and ES-cell transduction, immunocytochemistry and Q-PCR. In the course of the grant and based on her training she was upgraded to a Grade 4 and we have now employed her at that level in a further hESc grant obtained from the MRC. In this capacity she is now continuing her training in GMP aspects of hESc maintenance and obtained an official certificate of GMP training.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Uk NSCN annual condference 2010
