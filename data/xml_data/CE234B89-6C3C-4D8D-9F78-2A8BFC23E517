To bring physics to 11-14 year olds (in schools in the most deprived areas and a history of low university attendance) by:

- Giving them a clear idea of what physics is, demonstrating the scale of space in our portable inflatable Planetarium in a virtual tour and opening their minds to the huge variety of careers which become available as you take physics to higher and higher levels.

- Encouraging the pupils to take science as an option at GCSE level in order to raise their aspirations and widen their options in science and technology subjects, including pursuing a university degree.

- Encourage the pupils to engage with and consider research activities in the university as relevant to them in their own lives, understandable and linked to the national curriculum topics taught in their own classroom. This in turn should lead to a more active interest in physics related issues and topics, thus encouraging them toward taking physics at university.

- Providing a follow on Science Astronomy Club pack of resources and materials for school so pupils can explore the topic to a greater depth independently, enthusing them about the using NSO and engaging in other scientific pursuits.


2. To help the schools, teachers and 6th form volunteers to enhance their expertise in physics by hosting a preliminary CPD session for the teachers and 6th form students before workshops where they are supported and trained in:

- Setting up registration for the National Schools Observatory (NSO), making use of the NSO in their school and how to use the related analysis software and resources.

- Contributing ideas to be included in the design of the workshops and astronomy club so as to link the relevance of the research and technology the pupils relate to, to the national curriculum topics taught in their classroom. This should help change the trend of pupils' opinion that science in the real world is not linked to school science. (The Relevance of Science Education Project (ROSE) in England: a summary of findings - E.W.Jenkins and R.G.Pell 2006)

- Knowledge of the variety of possible careers involving physics receiving a careers pack containing up to date information on pursuing the subject at university that can be used as classroom display and to provide guidance for their pupils.

3. To involve and develop undergraduate students to be engaged with communicating their subject by providing training and experience in development, planning, delivery and evaluation of outreach and public engagement activities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outcomes of the project will be written up and submitted to the appropriate publication evaluating the success of the methods of outreach used.

A presentation summarising the methods and outcomes will be offered to outreach conferences (NWSA, Ogden Science Officer Meetings, etc).

It is proposed that this be offered to the STFC as a website containing all resources as Open Educational Resources (OER) PowerPoint, guidance notes, lists of props, details of logistics involved, evaluation forms, short videos, and Science Astronomy Club Pack, in order that any department could offer this type of high-impact targeted outreach without 'reinventing the wheel'. It might also encourage others to do the same with their outreach projects. The University of Liverpool's Department of Physics has agreed to host the website should that be considered desirable.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9965</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P00640X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
