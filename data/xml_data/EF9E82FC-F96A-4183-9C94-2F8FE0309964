Exposure to mechanical stresses is a normal part of physiology for such monolayers: lung alveoli deform during respiration, intestinal epithelia resist peristaltic movements in the gut, and endothelia are exposed to pulsatile fluid shear stresses in blood flow. The mechanical function of monolayers is particularly apparent in disease when mutations or pathogens affecting the cell skeleton (cytoskeleton) or intercellular junctions result in increased fragility of tissues (e.g. epidermis bullosa, staphylococcus blistering). Despite clear physiological relevance, little is presently known about the mechanics of cell monolayers.

Cells within these monolayers are tightly connected to one another by intercellular junctions: tight junctions form barriers restricting the passage of solutes whilst adherens junctions and desmosomes integrate the cytoskeletons of constituent cells into a mechanical continuum. To date, research in cell mechanics has primarily focused on isolated cells and much is now known about their mechanical properties as well as the underlying biology in normal physiology and disease. Comparatively little is known about the mechanics of monolayers and how it relates to the mechanical properties of the tissue's cellular constituents and their cytoskeleton. This is primarily due to the lack of specific experimental techniques to assess the intrinsic mechanical properties of tissues while monitoring cellular and subcellular traits.

We aim to develop a novel tool to stretch cultured cell monolayers that are mechanically isolated from any substrate. During tissue deformation, the applied mechanical tension will be directly measured and monolayers will simultaneously be imaged at subcellular, cellular and tissue length scales, such that the architecture of the sub-cellular components, the shape of the cells and their eventual reorganisation can be accurately monitored as a function of the imposed force. 

The studies enabled by this novel instrument will allow us to understand how the structure of individual cells and their arrangement relative to one another participate in setting the mechanical properties of whole tissues. As a consequence, we will be able to understand how pathological changes in the proteins that form part of the cytoskeleton or the intercellular junctions can have catastrophic consequences for tissue mechanics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Exposure to mechanical stresses is a normal part of physiology for monolayers and their mechanical function is particularly apparent in disease when mutations or pathogens affecting the cytoskeleton, adherens junctions, or desmosomes result in increased fragility of tissues. Despite clear physiological relevance, little is known about the mechanics of monolayers and how these relate to the mechanical properties of the individual cells constituting the tissue. The challenge is to design an instrument that enables precise control over the mechanical environment of tissues on time scales from 0.1s to hours while allowing for simultaneous high resolution imaging of subcellular structures.

We propose to develop a versatile new experimental tool for measuring the mechanical properties of cell monolayers and applying well-characterised steady forces onto cell monolayers to study their responses to mechanical stresses at all the relevant time- and length-scales. 

The tool will require precise control of the deformation and monitoring of the applied tension, with a compact design suitable for live microscopy imaging and environmental control. This will be achieved by using a closed-loop piezo drive to control deformation and a force sensor with an accuracy of 10uN to monitor tension. Control software will allow testing of time-dependent properties by imposing constant stress conditions or cycles of deformation. A laser ablation system will be built to create controlled cuts in the stretched tissue to characterise their resistance to fracture and measure their macroscopic adhesion energy. Image acquisition and image analysis will characterise cellular dynamics within the monolayer. High magnification microscopy combined with GFP-tagging will provide data regarding the subcellular organisation of the material. This new tool will pave the way for interdisciplinary investigations of monolayer mechanics and mechanotransduction at the molelular, cellular, and tissue levels.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic impact

Academic advancement and innovation:
To ensure the novel instrument has the highest possible research impact, we will present our technological developments and preliminary results generated at high profile conferences that cover relevant topics including tissue engineering, biophysics, developmental biology and cell biology in 2013 and 2014. We expect the instrument to attract interest from many fields in the global scientific community and that this will lead to the development of new international research collaborations over the next couple of years. Where possible we will disseminate our findings in general audience and/or open access journals. Furthermore, we expect that the imminent publication of our preliminary results in PNAS will bring attention of a wide audience onto the new instrument. 

Training and professional development:
Both GC and AK are actively involved in interdisciplinary training activities at UCL and Cambridge University. GC runs the &amp;quot;quantitative biology&amp;quot; module for the UCL Systems Biology training program, participates in teaching in the CoMPLEX DTP, and is a member of the new interdisciplinary BBSRC DTP. AK is an important contributor to the development of the Bioengineering curriculum in Cambridge, and teaches a number of relevant subjects ranging from material sciences to physiology. The project described here will be used to introduce students from different backgrounds to interdisciplinary research in the life sciences. Elements of the work will be used as exemplar projects for students in the CoMPLEX and BBSRC DTPs. The mechanical aspects of the project will also form the basis of a couple of 4th year engineering projects in Cambridge and are likely to attract students with a Mechanical/Bio Engineering background.

Throughout the course of the project, the post-doc involved, already largely independent and technically capable to develop this project, will receive further cross-disciplinary mentoring and benefit from regular interactions both in Cambridge and London. In addition, he will be involved in mentoring students and develop his own mentoring and leadership skills. This will aid his progression towards an independent group leader position. 

Societal and economic impact

Commercialisation and exploitation:
We expect our instrument to evolve towards a generic characterisation method within a couple of years and we will strive to use standardized components to enable interested laboratories to rapidly and easily build their own instrument using off-the-shelf components. We envisage that it could be utilized to study the effect of pathologic genetic mutations on tissue mechanical properties and test how drug treatments affect macroscopic tissue properties. Should there be interest from the pharmaceutical community, we will study the possibility of designing a new prototype in a format suited to high throughput screening.

Both the UCL and Cambridge University have efficient mechanisms to assist academics in the development of commercial applications of their research outputs and in the management of intellectual property rights (see for instance Cambridge Enterprise or UCL Business). 

Increasing public engagement and understanding: 
Previously members of the team have been involved in interactions with the wider community through public discussions and school visits. Through this type of outreach we expect this work to reach a wide audience, giving the public a better understanding of multidisciplinary research and an appreciation of the remarkable natural world in which we live. We expect to participate in one public engagement event during the course of this short project. We will use these opportunities to stress the important role played by basic science and engineering research in driving societal advances.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6917</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Labroatory for Molecular Cell Biology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Mechanisms of oriented cell division in stretched monolayers</gtr:description><gtr:id>70267784-01A8-454B-B177-773CC42DB62D</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>This research utilises our experimental system to examine how tissue stretch orients cell division along the the axis of tension.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UCL MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Buzz Baum</gtr:description><gtr:id>00C2B602-0544-4087-84A3-9B77BE30BB1E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>doi: 10.1098/rsfs.2014.0013

was to develop a versatile new experimental tool
for measuring the mechanical properties of cell
monolayers and applying well-characterised steady
forces onto cell monolayers to study their
responses to mechanical stresses at all the
relevant scales. The instrument was designed to
work on millimeter size suspended epithelia. Our
objectives were to design an instrument that
could: 

(a) stretch epithelia on time-scales ranging from
the fraction of a second to tens of hours.

(b) accurately record stress on the tissue in the
10-105Pa range with an acquisition rate &amp;gt;10Hz. 

(c) image the evolution of cellular and
subcellular morphology within the tissue during
stretching.

(d) study tissue fracture with a high degree of
control.



Objective a was achieved by integrating a fast and
precise motorised micromanipulator into the
experimental setup. This micromanipulator is
piloted via Labview such that movement and
feedback routines can be implemented to suit the
experiments to be conducted. With this setup,
strain rates &amp;gt;75%/s can be achieved signifying
that a monolayer can be extended by 30% length in
less than 0.5s. Driving at such fast rates allows
the study of the rheology of monolayers. For long
duration experiments designed to examine cellular
responses to application of extrinsic mechanical
stresses, the micromanipulator is utilised to
apply the initial extension with high precision.
The micromanipulator prong is then fixed at the
final position using glue and detached from the
micromanipulator arm. This allows multiple
experiments to be carried out in parallel. 



Objective b was achieved by integrating an SI-KG7B
force transducer into the setup. This allows
measurement of forces up to 10mN with a 1&amp;micro;N
precision at rates of &amp;gt;1kHz, far exceeding our
original goals. Data acquisition is integrated
into Labview, allowing force feedback routines to
be implemented. 



Objective c was achieved by purchasing a long
working distance high NA 30x objective and
integrating the experimental platform into an
environmentally controlled chamber. The new
objective allows imaging of large fields of view
with high signal and allows zooming on scanning
laser confocals.



Objective d required the integration of a laser
ablation system to the setup to create controlled
multi-cellular cracks in the tissue. The laser
ablation system was built to interface directly to
the FV-1000 laser lines and controlled through
Olympus software (similar to the one described in
11). It allows the generation of subcellular
cracks by cutting single junctions as well as
multicellular cracks ranging from 1 to 10 cells in
length. The fracture can be detected by optical
microscopy using the objective and chamber
described in objective c. Combined with molecular
perturbations, these measurements will be applied
to understanding the magnitude and biological
origin of intercellular adhesion.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The tool developed for this grant is now currently enabling research on:
