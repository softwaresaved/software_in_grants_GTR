The potential applications for these devices span a diverse range of sectors which defies a broad approach to identifying the market for them. The four main sectors where impact is expected are reflected in the national quantum technology hubs - imaging, sensors and metrology, computing and communications and it is expected that the establishment of viable commercial infrastructure in quantum engineering will be based on these themes. 

Many companies seeking to engage commercially with this technology have yet to see where the emerging technology fits with their own business strategy and this can discourage early adoption. Currently, each lab discovery that presents a commercial opportunity must be looked at on a case by case basis for its market potential and often with a technology push rather than market pull approach. It can be difficult for larger companies to see where this may fit into their supply chain and the volume of sales that these technologies might achieve, and so crucial early investment in start up or spin out technology is stifled.

At the laboratory and technology transfer office level within the quantum technology hubs there is an excellent understanding of where a device may make an impact but it is often difficult to identify other models and markets of interest. This project will instigate an independent market research study guided by the technology available and linking it, via a large manufacturing supplier of optoelectronic components, to the sectors and end users where it is most likely to gain commercial traction. The project will identify the largest market opportunities and the specific technologies that should be invested in.

Photonic sources are interesting to Gooch and Housego (GH) as an optoelectronics supplier and GH would like to identify the potential market and model for this technology. The Quantum Technology Enterprise Centre (QTEC) has been working with Milner Strategic Marketing (MSM) on developing a business model for single photon sources and MSM is in a position to apply this approach to the national programme. Thus far QTEC has engaged with potential customers and end users of entangled photon sources in the bioimaging and life sciences sectors. Apart from using photon sources as a quantum research laboratory tool, some promising applications have been identified in microscopy and biology. It is envisaged that this approach will form a database of usable technology and workable business models available across the programme and that this can be expanded to work for other emerging technologies within the quantum hubs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Quantum Technology Enterprise Centre (QTEC) will create a database of existing quantum technologies and their technology readiness level from across the national quantum technology programme. This will be translated into scenario planning and market research studies. From the report generated form this information National Quantum Hub members will obtain information on model routes to market, applicable sectors and potential customers or end users. The QTEC programme will achieve considerable exposure to help recruit new Fellows to further support and grow the emerging quantum technology industry in the UK. Finally, the project will become a blueprint for a roll out approach for QTEC regarding market research and customer engagement.

As a result of the project Gooch and Housego will develop a road map for future markets and technology, and position themselves as a go to supplier for the emerging quantum technology industry. This will help UK industry to establish itself as a key supplier into the emerging global quantum technology markets. 
If the market study leads to further collaborative R&amp;amp;D or the development of a product, by one or more of the partners, then this will safeguard current employee roles and support the creation of new jobs.

Milner Strategic Marketing will support the existing quantum technologies market research activity and become a go-to market research company for the quantum technology industry. The UK's quantum hubs will benefit through having access to leading market research into specific applications and sectors that they can then apply to their own technology development and businesses, giving them the best chance of success. With quantitative evidence of the most-likely market and thorough business models, large UK businesses will have the confidence to invest in quantum technologies. This will lead to job creation and revenue growth, which impacts on the wider UK economy.

As a whole, this project aims to ensure that the UK is a global leader in quantum technologies. Investing in the right technologies and having an informed development roadmap will give UK companies the best chance of success, leading to job creation, export growth and scientific reputational benefits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27788</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R020175/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
