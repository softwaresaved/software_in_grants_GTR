(SHS) during pregnancy and postnatal period: a randomised controlled trial</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/N006224/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>South Asia has one of the highest numbers of male smokers anywhere in the world. As a result, over a third of pregnant women in South Asia are exposed to second-hand smoke in their homes. This has serious health consequences for both mothers (such as increased heart- and lung-related illnesses) as well as the newborn (higher chances of stillbirth, being born prematurely and lung-related illnesses). On the other hand, the antenatal period provides a window of opportunity to change health-related behaviours in the entire family. Interventions that are effective in reducing the exposure of pregnant women to second-hand smoke have been tried successfully in richer countries but have not been adapted for large-scale implementation in lower and middle-income countries. 

Our proposed project addresses this gap in two such countries - urban Bangalore, India and peri-urban Comilla, Bangladesh. The sites are situated in a region with the greatest burden of disease from the effects of second-hand smoke globally. The project has two broad aims: The first is to adapt existing knowledge about what is known to work, into an acceptable and feasible intervention that can be delivered to the woman and her family members. This may include informing the woman and her family about the levels of second-hand smoke in her body measured by a simple test on her saliva; educating the whole family about the harmful effects of second-hand smoke on the mother and baby; and using 'communication-techniques' from the field of psychology and behavioural sciences to encourage husband and other family members to change the habit of smoking in the pregnant mother's presence. The second aim is to apply scientific methods to test the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing the exposure of pregnant women and newborn to second-hand smoke in both sites, and to determine the costs versus benefits of implementing such an intervention. 

The project will be undertaken in two phases. In Phase 1 (Development Phase: Months 0-12), we will interview pregnant women, their husbands, and other family members to gain an in-depth understanding of all the issues surrounding the problem of second-hand smoke in the household, including barriers we may face in trying to change this. We will use this information to develop an intervention that can overcome these barriers in an acceptable way. During this phase, we will also help our Indian and Bangladeshi counterparts gain the expertise needed to develop such interventions, and in scientific methods to test them. In Phase 2 (Trial Phase - Months 13-36), we will conduct a strict scientific experiment (called a randomized controlled trial) to compare our new intervention with education about second-hand smoke through a leaflet. We will identify 920 mothers in early pregnancy, who are exposed to second hand smoke at home (460 at each site), to receive either the intervention or only the educational leaflet. This will be done in a way that each woman has an equal chance of being in either group. We will collect information on all these mothers and families when we recruit them into our study and then in late-pregnancy, 3 months after both groups have received either of the two interventions. We will also collect information when the new baby is born, and then 3 months after his/her birth. The information collected will include how the pregnancy and birth fared; levels of second-hand smoke in the mothers' and infants' body through a test on their saliva; health of both mother and baby, and smoking behaviours of family members. We will compare the information collected in the two groups to see how well the intervention did. We will also collect more detailed information from some families to understand how the intervention worked (or failed to work, in some cases). 

The findings from the study will be shared with key academic, policy and community stakeholders throughout the duration of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Over a third of pregnant women in South Asia are exposed to second-hand smoke (SHS) in their homes with serious health consequences for themselves (increased cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses) as well as their new-borns (stillbirth, prematurity, and increased risk of respiratory illnesses). Interventions with proven efficacy exist but have not been tested at a population level in low- and middle-income countries. Our proposed project addresses this gap in in urban Bangalore, India and peri-urban Comilla, Bangladesh, sites situated in a region with the greatest burden of disease from SHS globally. The broad aims of this project are, a) to adapt existing evidence-based strategies (maternal cotinine feedback; cognitive-behavioural and motivation-enhancement strategies to engage husband and family; education) into a culturally appropriate, feasible multicomponent intervention, and; b) to evaluate its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in reducing SHS exposure during pregnancy and postnatal period. 
The project has two phases. In Phase 1 (Development Phase: Months 0-12), qualitative studies in both sites with key stakeholders (women, husbands and family-members) will inform the adaptation and piloting of the intervention strategies and build local research capacity. In Phase 2 (Trial Phase - Months 13-36), a single blind two arm two-site randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. We will randomize 920 women identified in early pregnancy who screen positive for exposure to SHS (460 at each site), to either receive the multicomponent intervention or only health education delivered through a leaflet. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, late antenatal, birth, and 3 months postnatal and include mother and infant salivary cotinine levels, pregnancy outcomes, infant respiratory symptoms, service utilization, health related quality of life, and smoking behaviours within the household. Process evaluation will help understand fidelity and feasibility issues.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate impact in three areas: 1) Advancements in the field of interventions to reduce exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) in mothers and infants; 2) Capacity building of Indian and Bangladeshi researchers; and, 3) Public health and policy strategies to improve maternal and child health. (See also Pathways to Impact statement). 

The multidisciplinary team drawn from psychological sciences, public health, and smoking cessation will combine strategies from their respective fields to develop innovative interventions to reduce exposure to SHS that are tailored to the South Asian context. The intervention will be designed with the potential for integration and scale-up. The strategies have the potential to be applied to other areas of public health where modification of household behavior is desired.
 
The project will lead to the development of capacity in Indian researchers to adapt interventions and conduct trials of complex interventions. This will be achieved through engagement of local research teams with experts in the UK, and through a series of workshops integrated into the study.
 
We plan to achieve maximum policy impact by actively engaging academic as well as non-academic beneficiaries (national and global health policy organizations, families, the wider community, the voluntary sector and the media) through our existing links with such bodies, thereby raising public awareness and understanding of the harmful effects of SHS and achieving public health and policy change.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>295563</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>IMPRESS collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>3CC4FE7D-5BAF-401A-835E-9B20D4EA8E9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1. Successful grant application: This collaboration has successfully secured MRC-DBT collaboration funding for next one and half year to develop and pilot an intervention to reduce second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure in pregnant women. 
2. Building capacity to analyse qualitative data: In-depth interviews carried out to assess knowledge regarding SHS hazards, and preference of intervention to reduce SHS exposure. In total 67 interviews with pregnant women, husbands and family members who smoke at home and husbands who do not smoke at home or do not smoke at all were carried out. The data was analysed using Nvivo software. The University of York led capacity building exercise helped local teams understand the analysis methodology and use software. Currently both teams are analysing data independently with regular input from the York team. 
3. Systematic review: A systematic Review was carried out to assess type of interventions used in similar situations in which pregnant women were the agents of change to reduce their exposure to secondhand smoke. 
4. Expert opinion: Experts in the area of smoking cessation related field were contacted and asked to provide rating for the selected behavioural change techniques using a modified Delphi technique. 
5. Finalsation of intervention: During last workshop of researchers, using detailed deliberation and consensus development, finalised interventions based on qualitative data, systematic review and expert opinion. The local teams have developed first draft of the intervention keeping in mind cultural sensitivity and local norms based on their previous experience and knowledge. 
6. SOP for saliva cotinine assessment: with the help of York University, the NIMHANS is using state of the art technology to assess saliva cotinine. They have developed SOP for this purpose and are currently standardising the procedure.

2. Building capacity to analyse qualitative data: In-depth interviews carried out to assess knowledge regarding SHS hazards, and preference of intervention to reduce SHS exposure. In total 67 interviews with pregnant women, husbands and family members who smoke at home and husbands who do not smoke at home or do not smoke at all were carried out. The data was analysed using Nvivo software. The University of York led capacity building exercise helped local teams understand the analysis methodology and use software.
