&lt;p>MiGen focused on the widespread difficulty that students routinely fail to see the point of algebra and cannot therefore use algebra as a tool for thinking mathematically.

&lt;p>In this project, we will assemble and disseminate a polished package for students and for teachers of computer and text-based materials arising from the MiGen environment to support the learning of early algebra.

Mathematics subject leaders will benefit in fulfilling their responsibilities for programmes of work and ensuring that teachers' activities align with the priorities of the curriculum and the school. In this respect, an easy-to-use and 'non-install' system has already been seen, by a few subject leaders, as a way to involve 'their' teachers in thinking about the pedagogical issues involved in teaching generalization, and a first step in encouraging staff to make productive use of technology.

Pre-service and in-service teachers will benefit from the distribution of the materials, allowing them to enhance their existing teaching of algebra with a unit or module that gets to grips with students' difficulties and misconceptions. 

Finally, key stakeholders, policymakers (regional and national) are increasingly aware of the economic and societal value of mathematics, and our existing contacts with government indicate considerable interest in our proposed package. In addition, the artificial intelligence approach we have adopted in MiGen can be seen as a more general pointer to the future use of technologies in educational settings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96147</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project was itself is about impact as mentioned earlier. We can point to further impact since the completion of the End of Award Report below. 
- Following completion of the project, the MiGen package has been introduced to MA students at the UCL Institute of Education as part of the Module 'Teaching and Learning with Digital Technologies'. Several students self-selected using the MiGen package to further investigate its potential as part of their module essay and some have tried the package out in their own teaching as part of their MA assignments.
- As mentioned before, MC-squared EU project (http://www.mc2-project.eu/) has developed a platform and associated authoring tools that allow learning designers and teachers to engage in collective forms of creative thinking when developing educational resources (e-books) for mathematics. 
- We mentioned in our End of Award Report that the work from this ESRC project was adapted into one unit of Cornerstone Maths (CM). The evaluation of CM established that CM can impact positively on pupils' learning of mathematics. Cornerstone Maths units have spread throughout the country and have even been 'adopted' for dissemination by several of the Government Mathematics hubs, with the result that the work from this Impact project is more now embedded in practice.
- In addition, as mentioned before, some activities in CM, which include some derived and adapted from the Migen work, have formed the basis of a research project funded by the Nuffield Foundation. This project follows up our observations in MiGen and with CM that teachers' own mathematical knowledge and associated classroom practices were enhanced when working with the materials. The Nuffield project aims to research the nature of the participating teachers' own learning with a view to producing a professional development resource that can support the school-based scaling and sustainability of the innovation. This project will reach 210 teachers in the London area.
- As planned in our anticipated impact of our original report there has been further direct and indirect further academic dissemination through publications and presentations at conferences with audiences including teachers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>74DDE586-DFF0-4D03-AA76-5468088D0FEE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project rolled out the outcomes of the ESRC/EPSRC-funded MiGen project, Teaching and Learning Research Programme (Technology Enhanced Learning; Award no: RES-139-25-0381), 2007-2011. Details are available at http://www.migen.org 

The project, 
? Assemble a package, including student materials and teacher guidance derived from the Migen project, which would have links to support the transition from the microworld developed, eXpresser and the language of paper-and-pencil algebra: 
? Develop and implement a tailored programme of dissemination to address diverse audiences.

Thus the scientific outputs Migen are captured in the package itself and the papers/presentations, and the wider impact of the ideas behind the materials developed.

A series of focus groups meetings were set up about the nature of the package . These indicated clear preferences that:
? the microworld, Expresser, should be completely web-based, requiring no installation. 
? The package should have more detailed teacher guidance and instrumentation support as well as closer alignment to the new National Curriculum. 

These findings shaped the development of the first version of the package MiGen Package v.1, which was trialled by 10 teachers. Feedback from teachers' interviews and classroom observations was analysed and a revised package MiGen package v2, created, checked and put on the web as the main output of the project. This is available at http://link.lkl.ac.uk/migen-package-v2. It includes downloadable pdfs of all the activities along with sample student work. The website also has a link to the latest version of the software at: 

http://expresser.lkl.ac.uk/?classKey=DEMO-LKL.

One of the major findings from the trial of the second version of the package in schools was the need for different types of what we termed, consolidation activities throughout the sequence of student activities using eXpresser to achieve the potential for optimal learning outcomes for students. This was supplemented our original model of incorporating bridging activities at the end of the sequence with eXpresser. This finding led to a publication in a key conference in the field (Constructionism 2014) showing the potential impact to the community overall.

Reflecting on the classroom activities, several teachers commented on the potential of using the developed model rules after the student activity for classroom discussion to provoke predictions of the total number of tiles -- to make clear the rationale for having developed a model rule. This was an explicit design decision of the research team, so it was gratifying to note that teachers too appreciated its potential. One said in particular that after the trial he could better appreciate that the 'USP [unique selling point] of the package is to look at generalising and structural aspects of algebra in a broader sense [] lower ability students who struggle with having too much to remember, having extra time on this to understand algebra better would be good for their algebra generally, and also transferable thinking skills&amp;quot;. 

Comments like this support the original MiGen vision: that interactions with eXpresser help 'sow the seeds' for a rationale underpinning algebraic generalization and can subsequently be exploited as a framework for learning conventional algebra.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The team has engaged with extensive dissemination activities tailored for diverse audiences, including for teachers and teacher-educators with more accepted for 2015. For sustainability and impact, the package has been developed further and/or adapted in:

? the Metafora project co-funded by the European Union, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) theme, 7th Framework Programme. Metafora created a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) system to enable 12 to 16-years-old students to learn science and mathematics. Metafora integrates eXpresser as one microworld for students (see http://www.metafora-project.org/).

? Cornerstone Mathematics, a collaborative project with Stanford Research International project, funded by the Li Ka Shing Foundation, (2011- 14), exploits the dynamic potential of software to enhance learning in KS3 mathematics. The mathematical goals of MiGen-eXpresser informed and radically shaped the design of one of three modules in Cornerstone mathematics. Thanks to this evolution, a number of innovations were made possible, which contributed to the usability and dissemination of the underlying pedagogy:
o complete redesign of the code involving a more fluid interaction, functionalities and linked representations;
o a substantial trialing with schools in England
o complementary materials that provide a replacement module for elementary algebra
