This is one of the first studies to focus on the systemic social, political and economic influences on societal acceptability of DV making a much needed contribution to research and national and international policy aimed at changing attitudes and preventing DV.
This work is important because DV against women is the most common form of violence against women worldwide and is far-reaching in its impact. There is clear evidence that gender equality is integral to the achievement of the MDGs, however the failure to address DV is a gap in the current MDGs. Research in over 35 countries worldwide has shown that women's and men's attitudes justifying DV is strongly associated with DV perpetration and victimisation. Thus, to optimally target resources into evidence-based prevention it is vital to identify those wider social, political and economic factors that reinforce societal acceptability of DV. 
This study will use nationally-representative household surveys with individual-, country- and regional-level data and sources of high quality metadata on the social and economic development of countries and geographic regions to answer a set of important questions about attitudes to DV across low- and middle-income countries and the systemic factors influencing these attitudes. For example, how do attitudes to DV differ between countries and geographic regions? Are economic factors like women's labour force participation, ownership of property and other assets associated with societal attitudes to DV? Does access to education and educational attainment explain differences in attitudes to DV? Does social development and economic inequality influence attitudes to DV? Are social institutions like family laws, access to productive resources associated with attitudes to DV? Does women's representation in Parliament and participation in public life influence societal attitudes to DV? 
While government legislation is considered important to combat this problem, there has been little research on which governments act and the effects of legislation on attitudes. This study will answer these questions by analysing the social, economic and political profile of nations (and geographic regions within which they are nested) which have DV legislation, and the effect of legislation on shifting women's and men's attitudes to DV. 
These questions are best addressed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. In addition to analysing datasets, a review of DV legislation and key informant interviews will be conducted with policy-makers and representatives of national and international organisations within select case study countries.
Data produced by the study will allow for the creation of a database which will provide robust and interpretable data on attitudes to DV within the context of key social development and economic empowerment indicators, and the existence and quality of DV legislation and policy. These data will be of interest to and can be used by academics across disciplines, policymakers, non-governmental organisations, international development agencies and donors interested in DV prevention strategies and the measurement of attitudes to DV as a component of gender equality and empowerment.
There is increasing recognition of the need to focus on prevention, however evidence-based prevention is still nascent especially in relation to tackling societal acceptability of DV. This work is timely given that the thematic priorities of UN Women are gender-based violence, economic empowerment and women's political participation and the focus of the 2013 UN Commission on the Status of Women is on preventing violence against women and girls.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT AND HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT
'The global development agenda should seek not only to address and monitor the elimination of specific gender gaps, but also to transform the structural factors that underpin the widespread persistence of gender inequalities, gender-based violence, discrimination and unequal development progress between women and men, girls and boys.' (UN System Task Force on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda, June 2012).

International Commissions, Consultations and Think-Tanks: At a time when the post-2015 (MDG) debate focuses on the 'big picture,' an examination of how attitudes to domestic violence (DV) may mitigate gender equality and women's empowerment is particularly pertinent and builds on current momentum ensuring DV remains an international priority. This project will make a vital contribution to the UN Commission on the Status of Women and Girls post-2015 consultation processes and debates by stimulating discussion on the development and use of indicators measuring societal attitudes and norms to DV and the systemic transformations required to change societal acceptability of DV. The robust internationally comparable data produced will benefit international organisations (e.g. UN Women, UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO and ICRW) by identifying the structural determinants of DV attitudes and norms, and how they vary across countries and geographic regions thus informing the strategic development of sustainable and effective cross-national DV prevention policies taking into account national and regional variations. This project will contribute to a new global narrative for international development, which includes gender equality as an essential component. Research visits to these international organisations (see Case for Support) provide the applicant an excellent opportunity to engage with and catalyse these discussions and debates.

National Governments: This project will draw attention of national governments and donors to focus on the urgent need to develop national DV prevention frameworks and policies that tackle societal acceptability of DV from a systemic, multi-sectoral and multi-level perspective by targeting discriminatory social institutions, and economic and political factors that influence these attitudes. It will provide an impetus to governments to critically evaluate existing DV legislation and policy, and to view attitudes to DV as fundamental to gender (in)equality and to a nation's social and economic development. In addition, by disaggregating data by gender, this project will generate much needed data for policy makers to make informed decisions about what works for women and girls in each national context, and hence develop DV effective and long-term prevention policies and programmes.
 
Grassroots Organisations and Advocacy Groups: The project will create a powerful advocacy tool for local women's organisations and other NGOs in these countries. It would provide robust evidence to these groups to call for international development agencies, donors, and their own national governments to spur investment into targeting societal acceptability of DV as a prevention strategy, as integral to empowering women and securing their fundamental human rights, and to view these social norms condoning DV as a development priority.

Given that DV against women is one of the most pervasive yet under-recognised human rights violations across the globe, and its impact on health, economic costs and society, it is hoped that through impacting DV prevention policy and practice nationally and internationally, this project will lead to better outcomes for women, children and societies.

In order to ensure that the research translates to a wide local and international policy and practice audience the dissemination of output to these beneficiaries will be carried out during and after the project life cycle through several activities.
