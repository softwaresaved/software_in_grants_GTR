Now a part of mainstream music-making, 'historically-informed performance' grows ever more sophisticated, but it has only just begun to seriously embrace a crucial element of performance from the past - that of improvisation.\n\nThe existence of strong oral traditions and the limitations of music printing meant that some of pre-classical music was written down in simple skeletal frameworks which were embellished by performers with well-honed improvisation skills. Improvisation treatises from this time document the way instrumentalists and singers learned their craft, with incremental exercises for practise and written-out examples of extemporisation for didactic purposes. Today, early music performers are more inclined to play those written-out examples than to improvise their own - comparable to a jazz musician playing a transcribed solo of another artist in a concert! \n\nImprovisation provided a way for musicians to put their personal stamp on music and was a vital part of their craft. It has been my objective throughout my AHRC Fellowship in the Creative and Performing Arts to promote more extemporisation in early music performances and bring the thrill of early improvisation to audiences, especially in the classical music sphere. To this end, with the support of an AHRC Research Grant, I established a 17th-century style improvising ensemble, The Division Lobby, to bring early improvisation to the general public. \n\nAs part of my research into extemporisation in 17th-century Italy, I have been looking at evidence in musical treatises and manuscripts which gives clues as to how performers improvised. Manuscript sources can be particularly interesting because they are so practical, and they can reveal interesting details about how music was performed. They are often books used by students in their music lessons or notebooks in which a composer might have been working out a composition. Recently such a 'working notebook' from 17th-century Italy came up for auction at Sotheby's which contained fascinating evidence in my research area about how people ornamented music, improvised on melodic lines, and extemporized accompaniments from a single bass line on chordal instruments, the art of basso continuo. The evidence in this manuscript supported many of my research findings from other sources, and also provided some extraordinary new evidence, particularly concerning my instrument, a long-necked lute called the chitarrone. \n\nI aim to demonstrate my discoveries practically by recording three CDs highlighting different areas of early improvisation practice. The first will trace the development of basso continuo through the parallel development of solo song in 16th- and 17th-century Italy. A chordal instrument player would extemporise an accompaniment over a single bass line with a numerical code which suggested the harmonies, a technique not dissimilar to what a jazz pianist or guitarist might do. \n\nThe second CD will highlight improvisation on the chitarrone, which will include solos with added ornamentation, improvised pieces, and ensemble pieces which demonstrate the instrument's role as a melodic bass. \n\nA third CD with the The Division Lobby will showcase different sorts of solo and ensemble improvisation with lute and chitarrone, violins, 'cornetti', harpsichords, organ, and a singer.\n\nThese CDs will stimulate interest in the art of improvisation, bring it to a wider audience, and encourage further extemporised performances. They will further understanding of the art and benefit colleagues, students, amateurs, and improvisors from other musical traditions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My experiences of practical research dissemination in concerts, workshops, and newspaper and radio interviews have shown me just how effective it is to impart such information in informal, non-academic situations. The general public welcomes and benefits greatly from the insights gained from experts who can explain even the most complex subjects in plain, layman's language. This benefits the experts as well - by fostering communication with their audience they build bridges which enhance the understanding and advancement of their work. \n\nWith my three proposed CDs showcasing various types of 17th-century improvisation I can demonstrate my research findings to a wide international audience including the general public, professional and amateur musicians (particularly improvisers) from all musical traditions, researchers, and students. \n\nThe practical application of my research will be illustrated through the performances of all the participants in this project, and CD booklets and website content for internet downloads. Busy free-lance colleagues who often cannot afford the time to survey the available information on early improvisation techniques and basso continuo will find the specialist information I shall impart through these CDs particularly useful to their work. \n\nThese CDs will be of great benefit to the ever-growing network of amateur early musicians who are hungry for opportunities to hear demonstrations of early improvisation and gain instruction from them. Early music societies around the globe, and lute societies in particular, will be eager to hear them and report on my findings through their publications. \n\nMy undergraduate students at the University of Birmingham, including students of subjects other than music, will find the practical illustration of my research on these CDs very beneficial to their studies. The project will also impact on students of the project's participants at the following institutions: the Royal Academy of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, University of Birmingham's CEMPR, Newcastle University, Southampton University, Hamburg's Hochschule f&amp;uuml;r Musik und Theater, Scuola di Musica di Fiesole, and Trinity College of Music.\n\nParticipants in early improvisation and basso continuo workshops and observers of open rehearsals related to this project will find useful information on the CDs for the enhancement of their study and understanding of 17th-century music. \n\nThrough my workshops and lecture/demonstrations I often encounter improvisers from other musical traditions who want to know more about my research and ask where they can hear my recordings of early extemporization. Collaboration with Linn Records will guarantee global distribution of my CDs through major retailers and website downloads, thus facilitating wide dissemination of my work. \n\nThe producers of BBC Radio 3's 'Early Music Show' are interested in a programme on the development of basso continuo accompaniment and early monody which would be of great interest to singers and accompanists and would provide a major opportunity for impact to the wider community in the UK and internationally through its 'Listen Again' service. \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32586</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This recording has been planned and produced with the objective of demonstrating the results of my research into the accompaniment of late 16th-/early 17th-century Italian monody.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3DE9E0E6-7124-4CAD-A808-B8DF6E33D0EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The planning and development of this CD had a huge impact on my personal development, the development of my duo with the tenor Mark Tucker, and the enlargement of our repertoire. Mark and I read through nearly every book of printed solo song from early 17th-century Italy as well as numerous songs in manuscript before choosing the repertoire to record for this CD; this was enormously revealing about the stylistic characteristics of each composer and the musical styles in the major cultural centres of Italy in the 17th century. We rehearsed extensively and honed the material with the other members of the continuo ensemble, resulting in a singularity of purpose and a distinctive interpretation of this repertoire. A major impact on other continuo players in the ensemble was a change in their accompaniment style after the dissemination of my ideas concerning basso continuo style in early monody; they were happy to adopt these ideas and experiment with them.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>CD recording of early monody with the tenor Mark Tucker</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Concert with The Division Lobby for the Little Missenden Festival, 15 October 2011.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1133D3A4-11E7-4114-96D3-DBF8384974D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This concert gave the group the opportunity to put its findings in rehearsal into practice, and to develop improvisation skills in performance, particularly in ensemble. The performance included the realization of 17th-century harmonic sketches or frameworks into actual pieces; highly original and individual performances were created. My research was disseminated to the audience through explanations before each piece of what materials were used as a basis for the improvisation and what methods were used to achieve the improvisations; this was much appreciated by the public. The concerts were the culmination of months of individual and ensemble work and my aim was achieved: to create concerts of early music which were completely improvised, which the audience learned from and enjoyed. This demonstrated that one could put together a programme which involved extensive specialist musicological research without the audience even being aware of it. 

This was an important concert to help revive The Division Lobby programme and add some new pieces in anticipation of our CD recording in the following week.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Harmonia Extemporanea: Improvisations on 17th century Italian sketches - concert 15/10/11</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>CD recording with The Division Lobby of repertoire we had been doing in our concerts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7D407C50-F24F-485F-8A3B-9776BCB784ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The purpose of this recording was to present the repertoire The Division Lobby had developed in concert, and to disseminate my research on improvisation and improvising ensembles in 16th- and 17th-century Italy. This innovative recording is documentation of my work and that of the ensemble. The impact on the group of doing a CD was enormous: recording improvisation is particularly challenging, especially in the circumstance of creating an entirely improvised performance, and we had to adopt a different approach to the recording process as a result. This CD created even greater focus in the group than ever, and everyone remarked that The Division Lobby project had made them much better improvisers. They now felt much more comfortable about improvising in public and on CDs; they felt they had been given many more tools to work with, and the opportunity to experiment in a sympathetic atmosphere along with other colleagues was vitally important to their growth as improvisers and to the success of the CD.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>CD recording of The Division Lobby</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This CD features the theorbo (long-necked lute) and the many possible ways it was used as a solo and ensemble instrument for chamber music; the repertoire includes pre-composed solos with my own added embellishments, an improvisation on one line, and another on all the voices, of a multi-voiced madrigal, an improvised toccata, and chamber music pieces with a virtuosic melodic bass line performed on the theorbo.</gtr:description><gtr:id>580D7E75-0747-4ED3-9699-7ED9BB9998E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The purpose of this CD is to demonstrate the many different ways in which the theorbo can be used, and there are some unusual examples which should change perceptions about the sort of repertoire that can and should be played on the theorbo. The pre-composed solos I recorded all contain an element of improvisation: variation pieces with repeats contain decorations in the repeats, pieces such as toccatas which contain sections of slow-moving chords have extemporizations added in these sections, (a practice suggested by 17th-century composers), and there are improvised toccatas and extemporizations on one or all of the voices of pre-composed madrigals. I am hoping that through this CD I can disseminate the suggestion that more improvisation is possible, desirable, and even necessary in our performances of early music. I have demonstrated how vital and effective it is to do your own improvisation on a pre-composed madrigal rather than playing one written by someone else. Finally, it is rare to hear a theorbo play a melodic bass part in a chamber music piece when in fact this was one of the most common uses of the theorbo in 17th-century Italy. I have demonstrated that many of the most virtuosic parts are playable on the theorbo. I hope this use of the theorbo will become more prevalent as a result of this recording.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>CD of solo and ensemble composed and improvised music for the theorbo</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in a programme of early 17th-century Italian chamber music entitled 'Italian Revolutionaries' with players from the Irish Baroque Orchestra in which I improvised a toccata in 17th-century style: three concerts between 5 - 7 February 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43824EB4-2983-44BF-B0AE-C412D80F5BA9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>For this programme of early 17th-century Italian music I used my research findings into methods and techniques for improvising toccatas, preludios, and similar pieces to create my own improvised toccata for these concerts. I developed a preparation 'scheme' for this undertaking which was based in part on past work in this area and also included new ideas derived from past improvised performances; in particular I endeavoured to use many more techniques for extemporisation practise from extant improvisation treatises from 17th-century Italy. This scheme instilled me with much more confidence and helped me to further hone my improvisation skills; I passed many of my findings and observations on to students and colleagues about how to prepare to improvise in public, which had a positive impact on their own learning and practise. It was also extremely beneficial to have three opportunities in quick succession to practise improvising this sort of piece for live audiences. Judging by the audiences' reactions to the improvised pieces and those of my colleagues, and comments from the audience after the concert, the extemporised elements of this programme were enthusiastically received and made a profound impact on the general atmosphere of the concerts: the public felt much more involved in the experience and very much enjoyed the more informal tone of the concert in general.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Concert at Club In?gales, a London venue featuring evenings of musical improvisation,  11/2/16</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15185B2F-1C86-43A7-9D3B-0799D8345F8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I participated in this concert of extemporised music with an early music colleague and the ensemble of contemporary improvisors Notes In&amp;eacute;gales, directed by Peter Weigold. This took place at Club In&amp;eacute;gales, which provides a platform for improvised music in an informal atmosphere more akin to a jazz club than a concert hall. Notes In&amp;eacute;gales did a 20-min set of their own contemporary extemporisations, followed by a set by my early music colleague and me of improvisation in 17th-century Italian style, using the traditional method of creating structures for improvisation derived from pre-composed madrigals. For a final set all the musicians joined forces to create further contemporary improvised pieces; for one of these pieces we used a 17th-century structure composed specifically as a basis for creating an extemporised piece. For a large percentage of this audience it was the first time they'd ever heard improvised music in 17th-century style, and their enthusiasm and interest was enormous. We provided explanations of the style and structures used and discussed the 17th-century materials we used to learn to improvise in this style. Many attendees were interested in finding out more about this type of improvisation and how they could learn to do it themselves. An arts journalist who attended the concert expressed an interest in writing an article about early improvisation in the near future, and asked to interview me on the subject. One of the most interesting aspects of this evening for me was the bringing together of musicians from diverse musical disciplines; added to this was the profound impact the 17th-century style improvisation had on an audience more used to listening to contemporary extemporisation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Post-concert talk for concert by The Division Lobby</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>40F5768D-8C8F-4A3E-8431-FCE870022B2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A post-concert talk was given by me and members of my 17th-century style improvising ensemble, The Division Lobby, for an audience of the general public.

This was an engaging discussion between the concert audience and the musicians about how the evidence regarding musical improvisation in early 17th-century Italy was used to create an improvised programme. Much information was imparted about the process of how one creates such an ensemble and programme. There was much interest in and information imparted about what material was used as 'framework' for the improvisations, and also about the musical instruments used.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.thedivisionlobby.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The three CDs recorded with funds from this grant are intended for international distribution to the general public.

In the meantime, these CDs are invaluable tools for providing illustrations of improvisation for lectures and workshops.
The preparation for these CDs and the improvised material performed on them has led to further programming of extemporised music in concerts, in addition to numerous invitations to teach workshops about early improvisation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7B431D19-0BD2-4085-B24F-A821C1F22976</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025581/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47D79871-3D9E-42F7-83E1-354D081901C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>120E89AC-386D-4E25-9417-A3FE4D6FE83A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
