It is commonly assumed that preschool children lack the discourse competence necessary to encode information in an adult-like fashion. Experimental studies have argued for instance that preschool children use definites (such as 'the duck') rather than indefinites ('a duck') in contexts where only indefinites are possible in the adult language (see e.g. Maratsos 1974; Emslie &amp;amp; Stevenson 1981; Hickmann et al\n1996).\n\nThis research proposes new, theoretically motivated diagnostics to identify signs of discourse competence. In particular, it aims to ascertain whether preschool children master the discourse notion of topic - a claim put forth in De Cat (2002) which has never been confirmed experimentally. Topics express what the sentence is about. In Spoken French, topics are obligatorily dislocated: they appear at the periphery of the sentence - indicated by the comma in (1) - and are resumed by an element inside it (here: 'il'). Topics have to correspond to information that is salient and recoverable in the context to enable the hearer to identify what is being talked about. In most cases, they must be definite.\n\n(1) Le monsieur, il lui donne sa balle.\n the man he to-her gives her ball\n\nTwo elicitation tasks will be carried out to ascertain (i) whether preschool children master the discourse notion of topic and from what age and (ii) whether they encode new vs old information like adults and from what age. A third, non-linguistic task will assess children's Theory of Mind in an attempt to disentangle linguistic from cognitive\nsources of target-deviance in the encoding of information. Each task will target the same 45 monolingual preschool children acquiring French (3 groups, aged 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 respectively), plus 15 adult controls.\n\nTask 1 will reveal the extent of their knowledge of the notion of topic. The test material will consist of 8 sets of 3 pictures setting up a scenario which will prompt the child to produce two types of sentences, depending on whether the subject is new or old information: sentences requiring a dislocated subject because a topic interpretation is obligatory (as in (1)); and sentences with a subject in its non-dislocated position because a topic interpretation is impossible (as in (2)).\n\n(2) Un monsieur lui donne sa balle.\n a man to-her gives her ball\n\nTask 2 will test children's ability to encode new discourse items (or referents) like adults. The general outline of this task is as in Hickmann et al (1996): the child is made to blindfold the interviewer and to explain to her what happens in two sequences of 5 pictures representing an event. A new referent is introduced in each picture (as an additional character). Children's productions will be analysed in two respects: (i) to evaluate whether they know the rules of new referent encoding and (ii) to evaluate the impact of non-linguistic factors on their encoding of new referents.\n\nThe Theory of Mind task will assess children's ability to distinguish their listener's perspective from their own. \n\nThe proposed study seeks to demonstrate the need to distinguish linguistic from cognitive underpinnings of discourse competence. Based on the applicant's previous research (including a longitudinal study of spontaneous production and a pilot experiment for Task 1), it is expected that children will be able to encode obligatory topics\nlike adults and that the contexts yielding errors in the encoding of information contrasts will be those requiring certain milestones to have been reached in Theory of Mind development. \n\nThis research will contribute to narrowing down significantly the search space for causes of children's defineness errors, which have been widely reported but remain little understood.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>72288</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings have been used in the language acquisition literature.

This is the earliest testable age of language production using elicitation techniques. As planned, data was collected from 45 children between the ages of 2;6 and 5;6, evenly spread across age groups. All the children, even the youngest ones, categorically produced topic-compatible forms in the topic condition (error margin = 1%, i.e.8/807 tokens), and they produced no such forms in the condition ruling out a topic interpretation (error margin = 3%, i.e. 9/255 tokens). This is the first time experimental evidence is provided for the early mastery of this discourse primitive. These results have been presented at the GALA conference in September 2007. 

2.This study has also provided clear evidence that preschool children use adult-like definiteness and structural distinctions to encode the information status of referents. Like adults, they use indefinites to encode new referents (although see point 4 below) and they never use existential indefinites to encode topics. Like adults, they encode new referents in structural positions associated with a focus interpretation. Like adults, they dislocate referents associated with a topic interpretation. This will be reported in full in the paper to be submitted to the Journal of Child Language. 

3.The findings of this research, combined with the PI's previous research on spontaneous production, indicate that the discourse notions of topic and focus are in place from the earliest stages of language production. These two notions are standardly regarded as discourse primitives. While more advanced aspects of discourse competence are clearly not yet in place at the time (see e.g. Kraemer 2000, 2003), the early availability of these two core notions calls for a reappraisal of wide-spread assumptions regarding (i) the general delay of discourse/pragmatic competence compared with syntactic competence and (ii) the difficulties inherent to phenomena that interface between syntax and discourse/pragmatics.

4.All children were found be able to encode newness distinctions using adult-like devices, in both experiments. Crucially, when children produced indefinites in contexts requiring a definite (which happened 9% of the time in the story-telling experiment), they always encoded the referent in a position structurally associated with a focus interpretation. Findings from the first experiment (see point 1 above) justify interpreting this as an intended new-information interpretation. Children's definiteness errors in the story-telling experiment are therefore not due to insufficient linguistic knowledge as to the information status of definites vs. indefinites. The role of cognitive development was also investigated, based on two Theory of Mind experiments. As expected from the literature, children younger than 4 were generally unable to

distinguish their own perspective from that of another person. The first milestones of discourse competence are reached prior to children's ability to evaluate the knowledge state of others.

5.Further avenues of research into children's discourse competence have been identified. The first one relates to children's evaluation of the salience of discourse referents. While children are able to evaluate whether a discourse referent is sufficiently salient to be a topic, they do tend to encode topics as pronominal elements in contexts where adults would use a full noun phrase. No direct correlation with Theory of Mind development has been found. A more likely cause (to be investigated in future research) could be young children's reliance on the visual context as preferred domain of reference (rather than the strict discourse context). The second avenue to explore is children's use of fragments instead of full sentences: Do fragments ever violate discourse requirements? Is their cause syntactic or pragmatic?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research provides evidence that the discourse and syntax components of the language faculty can interact efficiently from early stages of syntactic development. The next step would be to investigate which areas of discourse competence remain problematic for young children, and how to distinguish it from its cognitive underpinnings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7F60C99D-CD2A-4970-8204-43BE91DFC9AB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:id>ABA937C6-59C0-4569-B6FD-FE8CF0ABDE84</gtr:id><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Output of the story-telling experiment</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:id>54CE9D23-EED1-4F79-8326-1347CD937AF6</gtr:id><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Output of the topic experiment</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F2FE4C59-437C-4DE4-8E89-25230EF4F1CA"><gtr:id>F2FE4C59-437C-4DE4-8E89-25230EF4F1CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Explaining children's over-use of definites in partitive contexts</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>First Language</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7d529f4ede48cdd4c37632a5e24b3df9"><gtr:id>7d529f4ede48cdd4c37632a5e24b3df9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>De Cat C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9AB47BF2-8F98-4DB8-A877-DD6EA0DB9302"><gtr:id>9AB47BF2-8F98-4DB8-A877-DD6EA0DB9302</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experimental Evidence for Preschoolers' Mastery of &amp;quot;Topic&amp;quot;</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Language Acquisition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7d529f4ede48cdd4c37632a5e24b3df9"><gtr:id>7d529f4ede48cdd4c37632a5e24b3df9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>De Cat C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5229D23E-7543-4672-8E04-76E2DAF4B579"><gtr:id>5229D23E-7543-4672-8E04-76E2DAF4B579</gtr:id><gtr:title>Information tracking and encoding in early L1: linguistic competence vs. cognitive limitations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of child language</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7d529f4ede48cdd4c37632a5e24b3df9"><gtr:id>7d529f4ede48cdd4c37632a5e24b3df9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>De Cat C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-0009</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/559A10E8-A461-4605-9F0E-EEF4A2469279"><gtr:id>559A10E8-A461-4605-9F0E-EEF4A2469279</gtr:id><gtr:title>Egocentric definiteness errors and perspective evaluation in preschool children</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Pragmatics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7d529f4ede48cdd4c37632a5e24b3df9"><gtr:id>7d529f4ede48cdd4c37632a5e24b3df9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>De Cat C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D001099/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D3B0FA4C-49C7-4E19-A8D5-F19B1145C2CB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Semantics &amp; Pragmatics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
