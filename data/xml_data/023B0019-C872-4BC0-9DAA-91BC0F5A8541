The aim of this project is to investigate the impact of bursaries on students? academic outcomes - including annual test results, completion rates and degree classification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will use a unique dataset collected from UK higher education institutions. The data comprises individual-level data on undergraduate students from the UK and EU (ie those potentially eligible for bursaries), including the bursary they are awarded each year, academic outcomes, prior attainment and other demographic information.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim is to identify the impact of bursaries on the academic outcomes of students by exploiting variation in bursary rules across institutions. This will be achieved by comparing students with similar characteristics but receiving different levels of bursary due to the institution they are attending. To account for underlying differences across universities we will exploit changes in bursary eligibility rules within a university over time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The findings should be useful for universities and policy makers when considering the role of bursaries in improving student outcomes.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As well as the academic beneficiaries, this research has a number of non-academic beneficiaries. These are principally policy-makers, those working in the higher education policy field, and practitioners. 
The research findings will be important to policy-makers in higher education (such as the Minister of State for Universities and his team). The research would inform them about the effectiveness of this important element of public policy - providing student aid in the form of bursaries to young people. It would enable them to make more informed decisions about strategies for student support, and to help them understand how effective bursaries are to the success of students from low income backgrounds, in terms of doing well at university, and completing their studies.

The findings will also be important for those working in the higher education policy field, such as the Office for Fair Access, the National Union of Students and The Sutton Trust. This research would be valuable to OFFA since they are responsible for approving and monitoring access agreements - in which universities and colleges set out the access measures they intend to put in place, a key component of which is bursary spending. The research would also help the NUS in their campaigning for the most effective support for students, and the Sutton Trust, whose main objective is to improve educational opportunities for young people from non-privileged backgrounds and increase social mobility. 
In terms of practitioners, the research would be important to groups which represent institutions - such as Universities UK, Universities Alliance and the Million+ group, as well as the individual institutions themselves. Understanding the most cost-effective means of supporting disadvantaged students is essential to higher education institutions. They are compelled by the government to demonstrate they are attracting and supporting disadvantaged students, but must do so under strict budgetary controls. 
Such benefits are likely to be realised immediately upon completion of the project, since the findings would be easily translatable into policy recommendations for these users regarding effective use of higher education bursary spending.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>253004</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Guardian Media Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Guardian News and Media</gtr:department><gtr:description>which universities offer the most financial support?</gtr:description><gtr:id>BA021435-B0B0-4B3E-A129-6C6D909F10BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>the creation of a comparison tool to enable students to compare bursaries on offer at every UK university.

As I have only very recently published a working paper on these findings, the main impact of this work is still to emerge.

However, preliminary findings have already had an impact on a non-academic audience. 
In the first year of the award, I provided each university who participated in the project with their own report on bursaries, personalized to their institution. I received a lot of very positive feedback on these reports. 
As well as this, I have regularly updated other parties on progress made. These parties include civil servants (including HMTreasury and BIS), and policymakers in the HE sector such as Universities UK and OFFA.

Given that I have now produced a working paper outlining the main results of the project, I am now at the stage where i am ready to start feeding back the overall results of the project - i.e. the causal impact of bursaries on outcomes. As there is a great deal of conflicting information about the impact of bursaries on university outcomes, and since millions of pounds per year are spent by universities on bursaries, there is a lot of interest in the results of my research. 

The main way I intend to disseminate the results is via 2 dissemination events. The first is a conference on student support, which is planned for April 2016 in conjunction with the University of Durham. I have invited several university practitioners (mainly in WP teams) to attend the event, at which I will present the main findings of the research. I am confident that this event will result in the use of my findings by practitioners and policymakers in HE. 

For a second event, I would like to invite individuals from all institutions who have provided data for the research, as well as practitioners from other institutions, and policymakers such as BIS, Universities UK and the Sutton Trust, to a presentation of the results. The main challenge to this is lack of funding to organize such an event. As such, I am currently applying for funding for such an event through my own institution.

As well as these two events, I intend to write a blog post for my network, www.economicsofhe.org and also to prepare an article for CentrePiece, the in-house magazine of the Centre for Economic Performance at LSE. At the same time I plan to prepare a press release of the main findings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8B59914D-BB65-40E3-B316-7E26A387F393</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>UK universities currently spend &amp;pound;300m per year on bursary aid, yet little is known about the effectiveness or otherwise of this investment. The main aim of my project was to investigate whether bursaries have any impact on student performance at university. This aim has been met, and in addition the grant has generated several significant achievements, and has led to new opportunities, networking, and both academic and non-academic impact. These are detailed below. 
Significant new knowledge has been generated: using data collected for this project and econometric techniques, I have identified a significant causal impact of bursary aid on student outcomes. My results suggest that each &amp;pound;1,000 of bursary aid awarded increases the chances of gaining a good degree by around 3 percentage points, driven by completion of the final year and module scores. My findings are the first evidence of a causal link between bursary spend and student outcomes at university, which has academic and policy relevance. I also calculate the optimal bursary spend. A third important finding is that there is little heterogeneity in the impact of bursaries, according to parental income or student ability. These discoveries constitute the main aims of the grant, and the findings are documented in my main working paper.
In a secondary, descriptive paper I show that the bursary system is inequitable; as a direct consequence of the decentralized nature of the system, there are vast inequalities in aid receipt among poor students. Nevertheless I also find evidence that the system is working efficiently.

I have significantly developed my research skills over the course of this project including in: instrumental variables, multiple regression discontinuity design, heavily parameterized regression design

The grant has resulted in the creation of a new research resource: the data collected are of high quality and the investment of time in cleaning and standardization means the data can be used by myself and others for related projects. The data are unique in that they contain several variables that are, to my knowledge, unavailable in other datasets (most notably student annual module scores) and allow the researcher to track student performance within university over time. A further resource - a centralized source of bursary by university - has been developed in conjunction with the Guardian student website.
The research conducted under the grant has opened up several new research questions (which can be answered using the data), such as: what are the drivers of student failure and dropout; what role does module choice play in student performance; how do students specialise in their degrees; what is the link between gender and student performance. 

The grant has led to a new and important collaboration with a notable US academic, Dr Richard Murphy, Assistant Professor of economics at University of Texas at Austin (a top 10 worldwide economics dept.). Dr Murphy and I collaborated on the main bursaries paper. Future collaborations are planned with Dr Murphy based on the analysis and data collected as part of this grant. In addition, presentations of the bursaries work (most prominently at the NBER in Boston) has led to networking with prominent academics including Caroline Hoxby (Stanford), Susan Dynarksi (Michigan), Damon Clark (California, Irvine).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In my Pathways to Impact statement, I identified 4 main stakeholders: universities, policymakers, academics, WP groups. I have connected with representatives from all of these groups and expect many of them to put my findings to use. 
Universities: I provided each university in my study with an individualised report based on the findings. Moreover I have given presentations to the findings to Universities UK, and to 2 pan-university widening participation teams. I expect these teams to carefully consider the role of bursaries in their WP strategies, particularly given my finding that bursaries are effective tools to improve test scores and reduce dropout. Universities have had little guidance on the effectiveness of bursaries to date and the finding that they are effective should encourage them to invest in these forms of aid.
Policymakers: I have had discussions about my findings to individuals from BIS and HM Treasury. I expect these individuals to consider my findings from the perspective of offering guidance to universities; considering the role of bursaries in the context of national schemes (maintenance grants, loans) and in improving information about financial support to students. 
Academics: I have discussed and presented my findings at many academic conferences and presentations in the UK, Europe and the US. My findings are of value to those academics studying the role of financial aid on college outcomes; this is particularly unique since the majority of work to date concerns the impact of aid on college participation. I am currently working with the UK data archive to make the dataset available (in an anonymised fashion, subject to agreement with individual universities and the data archive). This will be of value to the academic community. 
WP groups: such as the Sutton Trust, the Bridge Group, OFFA. These groups have shown huge interest in my work, particularly in understanding how the decentralised nature of bursaries leads to inequality, and what can be done to improve information on bursaries to prospective students.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B0310C3C-5B6F-468C-A47A-AA452A0879EC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1396.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>affected widening participation strategy of university</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21AEB845-7DC9-4ECC-BDB5-33C095B79148</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I fed the results of my bursaries project back to UCLy.

I was also joined by my academic colleagues Dr Richard Murphy of University of Austin, Texas and Claudia Hupkau of the LSE. At the stakeholder group's first meeting we discussed the extensive database I have created, as well as preliminary findings which show the inequalities arising from the disaggregated nature of the UKs bursaries policy. We also discussed potential deadweight loss associated with allocating bursaries on a means-tested basis, rather than one targeted at more vulnerable individuals (such as those with poor prior attainment). we also discussed potential mechanisms through which the bursary scheme may work - such as by alleviating the need for individuals to work during study. Following this discussion, Avi Bram from BIS put me in touch with individuals from BIS who are responsible for the Student Income and Expenditure Survey, which tracks work and study. I am now able to access this data and can therefore augment my findings with this research into this data, which will shed further light on my findings.

I improved the WP teams' understanding of how other universities use bursaries, and inequalities that can arise from a scheme that is devolved to universities. Many WP teams were not aware of these issues and will adjust their bursary provision accordingly.

The data comprises the entire undergraduate population from at least 3 cohorts of students (starting in 2006) including basic demographics, parental background information, bursary awarded (including zeros), and university performance. 
With the help of my research assistant, I have made significant progress in cleaning and standardizing this dataset. The data was received by the universities in excel format, and since it was collected by each university individually there is no standardized format. We therefore have created a coding frame for each variable, and have produced a codebook so that the data can be easily understood by anyone working on the project, plus data from new universities can be entered into the project more easily. We have now imported data from 22 of the 25 universities into excel and fully cleaned and standardized this data. We have created 4 different datasets comprising information on i) student background characteristics and university performance ii) financial information iii) A-level and other entry qualifications iv) module scores so that datasets can easily be created focusing on certain elements of the project. In each case a single unique identifier has been created for each student that can link the datasets together. We have also created a standardized database which contains all the information above in one dataset.
I have also began collecting a range of other data to augment the dataset collected from universities. This includes data on university quality and university entrance requirements by course.

I am currently working with the UK data archive (Reshare) to make this dataset available to other researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>95D025B9-D024-4C36-9BE8-44DA8A039A26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The primary purpose of this database is to enable research into the impact of higher education bursaries on student success, as per the ESRC funded project. The dataset we have built is custom-made for this research and I am confident we will generate robust results given our large sample size and excellent coverage of universities. This database will also be an invaluable resource for conducting research into many areas of HE. The database allows me to track students through their studies, with information on their performance each year, the performance of their peers, their university, subject of study and final degree success as well as a range of student characteristics. This is invaluable data which will be used for future papers, for example looking at degree success by gender.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Higher education
