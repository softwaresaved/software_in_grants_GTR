With the growth of domestic viewing platforms and internet use, increasingly numerous avenues now exist through which cult followings can accrue. This leads to a greater mainstreaming of cult cinema as it increasingly enters everyday communication and as industrial forces continually incorporate cult activities and discourses into their marketing activities. While earlier studies of cult media focused upon cult as 'bottom-up' process through which fans took ownership of texts, it is now important to extend such perspectives by examining how particular cultural mediators - such as exhibitors, critics and producers - can also play a role within the emergence of cult status. This mainstreaming of cult media has been accompanied by an increasing international spread of the term, which has been intensified through the rise of global networks. It is the international dimension of cult cinema, alongside its shifting nature within a digitized global mediascape, which form the central focus of this network. The network will create connections between people interested in cult media, further facilitating understandings of likeminded research amongst a global cult community.

Cult cinema has often been linked to the celebration of a wide range of international films, but this internationalism is nevertheless limited. Many international cult films have gained their cult status in contexts outside of those countries in which they were produced. The reception contexts in which international films have gained cult status have tended to be metropolitan areas of the United States. This network aims to extend the study of international cult cinema to more fully come to terms with its global dimensions. This includes thinking about, for example: localized cult receptions around different parts of the world; particular ways in which the distribution and marketing of films in specific territories may have contributed to cult reputations; studies of cult films that are marked by internationalism at the level of production; cult films marked by the recycling of material originating from other contexts; the rise of international festivals and their significance for cult reputations. 

We also want to address technological developments and how they have impacted upon the field of cult cinema, in particular how they have affected conceptions of the local and the global. Home viewing technologies and digital networks have hugely altered the ways in which films are consumed and how cult fans form connections with other fans. This network will seek to research how fans may perform cultism online though e-zines and journals, blogs, discussion groups, and how online communities are increasingly being established to share cult-related material via torrent files. Whilst issues of virtuality and space-time compression have aided the international dimensions of cult fandom, we still wish to explore how place continues to be important within a networked mediascape, and to scrutinise the extent to which such internationalism may be limited through addressing the extent to which certain regions may have privileged access to networks. 

This network aims to create connections between researchers involved in cult media in and also outside of the UK, as well as selected figures outside of academia including cinema programmers and people involved in home entertainment services. It also encourages a broad range of approaches to cult cinema, including but not limited to: audience and reception studies; production analyses; considerations of controversy and censorship; adaptation studies; distribution and marketing studies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the network will largely be aimed at appealing to four main constituencies: policy bodies, cinema programmers, home entertainment media companies, and film journalists.

Policy Bodies
The main body in mind we have to invite is someone from the British Board of Film Classification. Dr. Sexton has previously worked on an AHRC project entitled 'Audiences and Receptions of Sexual Violence in Contemporary Cinema', which was commissioned by the BBFC and undertaken at Aberystwyth University under the supervision of Professor Martin Barker. This involved research that the BBFC were interested in and resulted in a lengthy report upon which they could draw upon in thinking about classification decisions. The BBFC has expressed an interest in gaining knowledge about cult film audiences as they believe that their heavy media use and tendency to adopt new technologies at an early stage are important considerations in making decisions about classification and new media platforms. They have also recently attempted to open up their archives to researchers in order to invite further critical analysis of policy and censorship issues. 

Programming
Increasingly, cinemas are programming special nights advertised as cult cinema nights, as they see this as something that can attract viewers. We will engage further in such processes through programming a specialist cult cinema season at the Star and Shadow Cinema in Newcastle and inviting specialist researchers to introduce each screening. The programmers of the Offscreen film festival, meanwhile, have already expressed an interest in academic debates about cult cinema, and this festival event will allow greater dialogue between academics and other constituencies.

Home Entertainment Publishers
One area already where academics disseminate findings to the broader public (and therefore have to adapt their writing in terms of wider accessibility) has been through providing materials to accompany home entertainment releases of films (providing contextual material and analyses of films, for example). This is both through writing essays for booklets, providing voice-over commentaries, and contributing to extras on DVDs and Blu-Ray releases. By further forging links with publishers, this will provide greater opportunities for a range of researchers to contribute to such materials, and therefore to inform the wider consuming public about aspects of cult cinema.

Journalism
As with home entertainment extras, journalistic writing about film is also an area where academics can sometimes also produce work. We would like to invite a number of journalists (both academic and non-academic) in order to discuss aspects related to cult cinema, which is of particular importance as the word 'cult' is increasingly common within journalistic</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19764</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Global Cult Cinema Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E2BC8989-5D80-42B0-A492-4E97FB29966B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A one-day symposium held in Vancouver which involved international participants discussing areas of global cult cinema.
