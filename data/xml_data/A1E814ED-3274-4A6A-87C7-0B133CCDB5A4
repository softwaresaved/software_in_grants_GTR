One of the reasons for the rapid expansion of rice in Africa has been the introduction of 18 upland rice cultivars known as NERICA. These interspecific cultivars, generated by crossing the African rice species (O. glaberrima) with the Asian rice species (O. sativa), are high yielding and have excellent drought tolerance and disease resistance. Thus, subsistence farmers working in these upland production environments are increasingly replacing maize, and even sorghum, with NERICA rice. However, the soils of these cereal growing areas are infested by the pernicious parasitic weeds S. asiatica or S. hermonthica, which increasingly limits rice production; the development of new management strategies is essential. The use of Striga-resistant cultivars, as part of an integrated control programme, is recognized as sustainable and cost effective yet we still do not know the identity of genes that make some cereal cultivars more resistant to these parasites than others, nor do we have enough different types or sources of resistance for breeding programmes. This is important because the Striga seed bank is so genetically diverse that the durability of resistant crop varieties is compromised by the potential for rapid evolution of parasite virulence. Thus, the long-term success of host cultivar resistance for the control of Striga requires the identification and exploitation of multiple sources of host resistance genes together with a greater understanding of the genetic variation for virulence within and among Striga populations from different locations. Such knowledge will allow us to combine appropriate resistance genes in cultivars that are suitable for different agro-ecological zones and to manage the use of cultivars more effectively such that virulence evolution is delayed. The aim of this project is to identify multiple Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and candidate resistance genes underlying resistance in rice to different Striga species and ecotypes and characterise, for the first time, Striga loci that enable parasites to overcome specific host resistances.
To achieve our aims, we will utilise molecular/genetic and population genomic approaches combined with extensive field testing of materials for resistance to Striga. We will identify multiple sources of resistance in rice to Striga species by phenotyping populations of rice plants in which small segments of the genomes of either O. glaberrima or O. rufipogon (wild ancestor of cultivated rice) have been introgressed into a tropical O. sativa background (Chromosome Segment Substitution Line populations) to determine the location of the resistance QTL/genes on these rice genomes. We will fine map an existing region of rice chromosome 12 (known to contain resistance genes) to identify those responsible and validate their function using a novel, high throughput, 'gene screen' based on Agrobacterium rhizogenes -induced 'hairy roots' in rice cultivars. We will use a population genomics approach to identify Striga loci that enable parasites to overcome host resistance(s) in specific cultivars and analyse their spatial variation within and amongst different parasite populations. A selection of our material will be screened at field sites in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to characterize their field expression of resistance as well as their levels of tolerance and yield across seasons and to expose our material to farmers and seed companies and get valuable feed-back from them. The project will generate resistant and adapted cultivars that can be used immediately by farmers working in Striga-infested areas and breeding material and valuable insights to enhance the work of rice breeders to further improve the resistance of farmer preferred cultivars.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Rice production in Africa is expanding faster than any other cereal following the introduction of 18 upland rice cultivars known as NERICA.

Farmers: A key output of this project will be the identification of multiple Striga resistance QTL/genes from the African the rice species O. glaberrima and wild rice species O. rufipogon resulting in the development of new upland rice cultivars with superior resistance and tolerance to Striga. Farmers working in rain-fed uplands in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where Striga infestation is endemic will be the prime beneficiaries of the project. In the short term our field trials will reveal how well our resistant cultivars (existing cultivars and new materials generated in the project) perform in different environments and identify the best Striga resistant/tolerant rice genotypes available. This, coupled with greater knowledge of the Striga population virulence loci in different areas, will lead to clear and useful recommendations for cultivar choice in Striga-infested areas. In collaboration with seed companies the project will be instrumental in the evaluation procedures required for release of some of the cultivars or advanced breeding lines. We anticipate the release and adoption of new improved rice cultivars in Uganda within the time scale of the project or soon afterwards.

Plant breeders: Plant breeders focusing on upland rice will clearly benefit from the proposed research efforts. The identification of multiple QTL for resistance to different ecotypes of Striga will be invaluable as sources of resistance for MAB programmes. The fine mapping of our existing Striga resistance QTL (STR12.1) and identification of the resistance gene(s) will be of immediate use to breeders for transfer to farmer preferred cultivars. Within the project we will produce fertile Near Isogenic Lines carrying the STR12.1 QTL/allele to serve as direct candidates for variety release or as high breeding value progenitors in selection schemes. We will also develop perfect markers for the STR 12.1 sequence, making the marker-based prediction of resistance levels in breeding programs 100% certain. In addition, iBridges lines (fertile interspecies O. sativa/O. glaberrima lines) developed at CIAT will allow breeders to rapidly transfer genes and QTL from the O. glaberrima genome (via MAS) into farmer preferred cultivars.

Seed companies and NGOs: The seed companies involved in this project will be able to conduct the compulsory cultivar evaluation of adapted material prior to release as part of our field trials. By linking up with our project and partners (CIAT, AfricaRice and NGO's) seed companies will receive new adapted rice lines that have a high potential for release and gain new avenues to disseminate seed and make profits. Our NGO project partners will benefit by the partnership with Ugandan and Kenyan universities, Africa Rice Center and the private seed companies as it will extend their reach within the countries where they operate as well as within the East African community.

Scientists and the Academic community: The project PIs and partners will benefit from the continuation of existing and new partnerships. Training workshops, and doctoral programmes in areas such as plant biotechnology and breeding, will contribute to building capacity in Africa. The academic community will benefit from the findings in this study as it will enhance understanding of the molecular genetic basis of resistance in rice to Striga and identify Striga genomic regions harbouring virulence loci allowing us to address questions about the evolution and spread of virulence within and amongst Striga populations. High quality research papers will benefit breeders, geneticists and those working in the field of plant parasite interactions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1183421</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited to take part in and give a presentation at the UK-Japan Workshop    'Rhizosphere Interactions  - towards Global Food Security' at the RIKEN Yokohama Campus  5-6 March 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C384F0E3-7C2A-41AC-B983-2947FE7E35EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to attend and speak the UK-Japan Workshop at the Riken Institute Japan on 5 and 6 March 2014.

The farmers assessed the performance of the rice cultivars under Striga infestation and ranked them according to many criteria.

The farmers were very interactive and we had discussions which lasted a full day about the rice cultivars and why the farmers preferred certain cultivars. The farmers were excited by the performance of several of the Striga-resistant cultivars in the field trial and they have asked for seeds of several cultivars to grow in their fields in the next season in preference to the cultivars grown at present (all of which are very susceptible to Striga). Many of the cultivars in the field trials performed and yielded very well under Striga infestation compared to the 'local' cultivars grown by the farmers. We are talking to local seed companies about the possibility of multiplying seeds of several of the Striga-resistant cultivars.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>17000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC-DTP studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>EA3F09D4-A88A-4FE8-9EBD-386845FC7444</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant is currently in its final year. At present the objectives of the grant are being met. A brief summary is given below:

1. Identification of multiple Quantitative Trait loci (QTL) and genes underlying post-attachment resistance in rice to a range of ecotypes of the most important Striga species using CSSL populations (O. glaberrima X O. sativa and O. rufipogon X O. sativa).

In order to identify new QTL for Striga resistance we screened the parents (together with selected lines) of three different mapping populations (O. rufipogon X O. sativa CSSL population; Nipponbare X Koshihikari BIL population and Azucena x IR64 RIL population) against two new ecotypes of S. hermonthica (from Mbita Kenya and from Namutumba, Uganda) and three ecotypes of S. asiatica (from the USA, Tanzania and Ethiopia). 

Following this analysis we phenotyped the CSSL population (O. rufipogon X O. sativa) for resistance to S. hermonthica (Kibos isolate). However, the QTL analysis did not reveal any major QTL for resistance. This suggests that resistance in the O. rufipogon is composed of a number of minor genes acting together. These genes cannot be identified further from a CSSL population.

At the end of year 1 Dr Mathias Lorieux (PI) sent us a new RIL mapping population derived from a cross between IR64 (O. sativa ssp. indica) (which is very resistant to S. hermonthica (Kibos)) and Azucena (O. sativa, tropical japonica sub species) which is very susceptible to S. hermonthica. All 168 lines of this population have been genotyped by sequencing (GBS) by Dr Lorieux and colleagues, providing dense molecular markers for each line. 

A BBSRC-DTP-funded PhD student (Emily Beardon) supervised by Prof Scholes and Dr Lorieux (CIAT/IRD), started her PhD in association with the SCPRID project in 2013. Emily and Alexis Moschopoulos (SCPRID Post Doc) phenotyped the population for resistance to S. hermonthica (Kibos). A QTL analysis revealed a highly significant QTL on chromosome 12 (IR64 allele) at a very similar location to the QTL for Striga resistance discovered in Nipponbare. This suggests that the same gene or genes may be involved in the resistance in IR64 to S. hermonthica. This discovery also supports our hypothesis that the chromosome 12 Striga resistance QTL is very important for resistance in rice to S. hermonthica. 

We are currently writing a paper for submission to 3G in June 2016.

Ms. Emily Beardon won Best Poster prize at the annual BBSRC White Rose Cohort Training Day in November 2014, at Fera for her work on the identification of Striga resistance genes

Our project partners at NIAS, Japan (Dr Hori and Professor Yano) have produced a BIL population derived from a cross between O. glaberrima (CG14) and O. sativa (Koshihikari). This population is now ready to phenotype for resistance to S. hermonthica. The phenotyping will take place in the summer of 2016.


2. Fine map the Striga resistance QTL on chromosome 12 (STR12.1) to identify candidate resistance genes and to develop Near-Isogenic Lines (NILs) that will serve as direct candidates for variety release or as high breeding value progenitors in selection schemes.

We have fine mapped the Striga resistance QTL on chromosome 12 of the Nipponbare genome and identified 48 candidate genes. Many of these were predicted to encode retro-transposons and thus unlikely to be involved in resistance. However 15 genes were annotated as orthologs of resistance genes in other species. Other genes were also predicted to encode small peptides or were annotated as 'expressed proteins'. 

In collaboration with Dr Hori at NIAS, Japan, the equivalent region of chromosome 12 from the susceptible rice cultivar Koshihikari was sequenced to allow us to compare the gene sequences in the resistant (Nipponbare) and susceptible (Koshihikari) parents of the mapping population. This revealed that the genome structure was very different between the two cultivars in this region of chromosome 12. Nipponbare contained a region of ~200kb that was not present in the Koshihikari genome and on either side of the Nipponbare-specific region there were significant rearrangements in genome sequence/structure. The Nipponbare specific region contained 5 of the 15 genes within the QTL region annotated as orthologs of disease resistance proteins.

Alexis Moschopolous has profiled the expression of all genes of interest in roots of Nipponbare and Koshihikari during the time course of the resistance response (using qRT-PCR). This has shown that only 6 genes are significantly unregulated (&amp;gt;2 fold) in infected roots of Nipponbare compared to uninfected roots (within the whole QTL region). These genes are not up-regulated (or are not present) in Koshihikari roots infected with S. hermonthica (compared to uninfected roots). Three of the genes are located within the Nipponbare-specific region and 3 in other locations within QTL region.

Following the identification of the Striga-resistance QTL obtained from phenotyping the IR64 x Azucena RIL population, we carried out a bioinformatics analysis of the gene sequences present in Nipponbare and IR64 and also compared these with the gene sequences (where present) in Koshihikari. Only one gene sequence within the QTL region has an identical nucleotide sequence in both Nipponbare and IR64 but is different in Koshihikari and one other is very similar in Nipponbare and IR64 but different in the two susceptible cultivars. The function of these genes (together with three other candidate genes from the Nipponbare specific region) will be investigated further. 

In order to investigate our hypothesis that the gene(s) present within the Striga resistance QTL on chromosome 12 may be important for Striga resistance in a range of rice cultivars, Dr Lorieux carried out an 'allelic diversity' analysis to determine whether 121 different rice cultivars have the Nipponbare allele for our candidate resistance genes or a 'different' allele. This analysis was possible as Dr Lorieux is involved in a project to resequence the genomes of 121 rice cultivars and thus had access to high density markers for these genomes. This analysis has revealed exciting differences between cultivars (and species and sub species of rice) with respect to allelic diversity across the genes in the QTL region and has allowed us to hypothesize which cultivars may show resistance to Striga (assuming that no other major resistance genes are present). We are now testing our hypothesis by phenotyping a selection of the most informative cultivars to determine their resistance to S. hermonthica.

This study is currently being written up for publication in 2016.

In conjunction with Dr Mathias Lorieux (IRD/CIAT) and colleagues at IRD Montpellier, we are able to phenotype a new rice diversity panel composed of 160 different O. glaberrima (African rice) cultivars in order to carry out a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). This diversity panel has been assembled by scientists at IRD Montpellier in conjunction with AfricaRice. The sequencing of 166 rice genotypes to produce high-density SNP marker maps is being carried out at IRD at the moment. We are very fortunate to be able to use this new diversity panel to identify candidate Striga resistance genes within the O. glaberrima genome. 
In the summer of 2015 we phenotyped all the O. glaberrima lines (replicated 4 times) in rhizotrons at Sheffield University. This large scale phenotyping experiment (greater than 1000 rhizotrons) took 5 months to complete. Initial results are very promising as we have an excellent distribution of susceptibility and resistance amongst the cultivars, a prerequisite for a GWAS analysis. The data are currently being analysed.


3. Validate the function of putative resistance genes using a novel, high throughput, 'gene screen' based on Agrobacterium rhizogenes -induced 'hairy roots' in rice cultivars.

The candidate genes have been cloned and constructs made to allow us to over-express and knock out (using RNAi) the genes of interest to test their effect on susceptibility to Striga. We have started the rice transformation process (using A. tumifaciens) rather than A. rhizogenes.

4. Screen rice genotypes at field sites in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to determine the genotype X environment and genotype X Striga ecotype interaction effects on resistance, tolerance and yields across seasons.

The main objective of the fieldwork is to screen a set of upland rice cultivars (both O. glaberrima, O. sativa (ssp japonica and indica) and interspecifics) for resistance against the parasitic weed Striga hermonthica (in Uganda and Kenya) and Striga asiatica (in Tanzania) and yielding ability under local conditions. A second objective is to gain an understanding of farmers' preferences with respect to resistant cultivars and to produce a short-list of potentially suitable upland rice cultivars for release in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. 
Two years (2014 and 2015) of variety screening trials have been conducted as planned in Mbita (Kenya), Kyela (Tanzania) and Namutumba (Uganda) with 25 diverse rice genotypes, including a number of resistant and susceptible checks. In Kyela and Namutumba, where the screening trials were conducted in (upland) rice production areas, farmer participatory variety selection exercises have been organised. A large number of the genotypes showed good resistance against both Striga asiatica and S. hermonthica and combined resistance with good rice grain yields. Among the most promising varieties identified are SCRID090, NERICA-10, -4 and -2 for Striga resistance and yields. Ble Chai, SCRID090 and NERICA-10 were the most preferred by farmers at both locations Kyela (Tanzania) and Namutumba (Uganda).
The 2015 harvests at all three locations have just finished. Grain, straw and Striga dry weights will be obtained in the next month allowing analysis of the data to begin. Now that we have two seasons of data we aim to publish the results of the study in 2016.


5. Use a population genomics approach to identify Striga loci that enable parasites to overcome host resistance(s) in specific cultivars and to analyse their spatial variation amongst different parasite populations.

The aim of this part of the project is to identify virulence loci within the Striga hermonthica (Sh) genome that allow parasites to overcome host resistance genes in different rice cultivars by using next generation sequencing and population genomics approaches.
To achieve this two NERICA rice cultivars (N7 and N17) with contrasting susceptibility to S. hermonthica (Kibos ecotype) were infected and Striga individuals collected. Even though N17 showed good resistance to this ecotype one or two Striga individuals per rice plant grew normally suggesting that they possess the virulence genes to overcome the resistance.
DNA was extracted from 6 batches of 100 S. hermonthica individuals collected from NERICA 7 and NERICA 17. Short insert libraries were prepared and the DNA sequenced using Illumina sequencing. Sequencing reads were mapped to coding regions of the S. hermonthica transcriptome and to the reference genome of a related species, S. asiatica. 
A pipeline to analyse the sequencing reads and identify SNPs/genes showing strong allele frequency differences between the plants growing on the two contrasting hosts was developed. This has resulted in a list of candidate genes involved in virulence. 

To map the sequencing reads more accurately to the S. hermonthica genome and to include other non-coding genomic regions that could also be functionally important, we are also sequencing the S. hermonthica genome from one single S. hermonthica plant. Plant tissues have been collected from one single large S. hermonthica plant growing on a susceptible rice cultivar (NERICA 7) and high quality DNA has been extracted and sent for library preparation (short and long insert libraries) and Illumina Hi-Seq sequencing at Edinburgh Genomics (PI Mark Blaxter). Once the sequencing is complete long contigs will be assembled and the pooled sequence reads will mapped to the contigs and data re-analysed to identify candidate virulence loci.

In order to determine whether virulence loci identified in the S. hermonthica Kibos isolate exist in other Striga populations Prof Julie Scholes, Dr Alexis Moschopolous and Dr Mamadou Cissoko collected samples of Striga hermonthica leaf tissue from greater than 1000 Striga individuals parasitising the different rice cultivars at both the Ugandan and Kenyan field sites. Each sample was immediately placed in a 2 ml eppendorf tube containing silica gel to dry the leaf tissue rapidly. Samples were then sent back to Sheffield where they were transferred to clean barcoded eppendorf tubes and frozen at -80 oC. All samples have been entered into a database. DNA has been extracted from a small selection of samples to check quality. All samples produced high quality intact DNA. 

6. Build capacities among African students and early and mid-career professionals in plant sciences.

Rice is becoming a major food crop in Uganda. Changes in consumption trends and increased population have led to increased production of rice over the years. In 2003, the government of Uganda encouraged the adoption of the high yielding upland rice NERICA varieties, as one of the strategies to eradicate poverty and increase food security. Since the adoption of NERICA 1, 4 and 10, rice production has risen both in acreage and volume of production. However, despite the importance of rice, its production per unit area is currently declining in Uganda and one of the major constraints that has been identified as contributing to this decline is the increase in the parasitic weed, Striga hermonthica.

To enhance capacity in rice research in Uganda, The School of Agricultural Sciences, Makerere University recruited Mr Nicholas Kayongo, to undertake a 2-year research MSc. degree entitled &amp;quot;Farmer Participatory variety screening for Striga hermonthica resistance in Upland rice in Eastern Uganda&amp;quot; associated with the BBSRC-DfID SCPRID project. Nicholas Kayongo is supervised by Dr Jenipher Bisikwa and co-supervised by Prof Scholes and Dr Rodenburg. 

The overall objective of the study carried out at the SCPRID field site in Namutumba is to screen twenty five (25) upland rice cultivars, most of them introduced from AfricaRice Center Tanzania in order to identify cultivars with good resistance to Striga hermonthica infestation and which produce high yields under Striga-infested conditions in Uganda. The specific objectives of the field work included identification of rice cultivars with good resistance acceptable to local farmers and identification of resistant cultivars with relatively high yields under Striga-infested conditions.

Mr Kayongo has learned how to design and carry out farmer surveys, experimentally design and set up a field trial, measure the growth and yield of the rice cultivars, and quantify resistance/susceptibility to S. hermonthica throughout the season. He has now conducted the field trial in 2015.

In addition to the field work conducted at the field site in Namutumba, Nicholas also visited the University of Sheffield from October 2014 to January 2015 for a 3 month research training visit. During this time he characterised the phenotype of the most resistant cultivars from the Namutumba field trial to complement the field data. Mr Kayongo learnt how to grow and infect plants in rhizotrons, quantify resistance and tolerance of the cultivars to the field ecotype of S. hermonthica (Namutumba) under controlled environment conditions. Nicholas has just finished writing his Masters thesis and will submit in May 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Please see above text.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>866CA8CC-A879-4752-A6B0-B5E8E78F0718</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/ABD00108-7E52-4045-B828-CE92CD9DF618"><gtr:id>ABD00108-7E52-4045-B828-CE92CD9DF618</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do NERICA rice cultivars express resistance to Striga hermonthica (Del.)
