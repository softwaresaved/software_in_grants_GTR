The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Birkbeck hosts a relatively small, but very active, planetary science research group, specialising principally in lunar science and exploration, meteoritics, and astrobiology. Over the last five years our group has led (i.e. has first-authorship of) 25 peer reviewed papers in the international planetary science literature, has made significant contributions (i.e. co-authorship of) 19 additional peer reviewed publications, and contributed over 75 additional publications (including over 55 extended abstracts presented at major international conferences). 

The present application is intended to advance our work in these areas by providing support for one post-doctoral research assistant and two Ph.D. studentships in the areas of astrobiology early solar system studies, and lunar sample analysis. All three areas fit into national and international priorities for planetary science, and in recent years our group has demonstrated international leadership in all three areas.

The specific projects to be supported by the present grant application are:

(1) &amp;quot;Searching for Past or Present Life on Mars Guided by Earth-Based Analogues: Maximising the Astrobiological Potential of Planetary Rovers&amp;quot;. This project is designed to assist in the search for past or present life on Mars using rover-borne multi-spectral imaging systems to allow the correct identification and interpretation of astrobiologically relevant minerals on the planet's surface (e.g. minerals that formed in the presence of water). This information will be used to inform operating procedures for ESA's ExoMars mission, and other similar missions which may be planned in the future. 

(2) &amp;quot;Mixing Material in the Early Solar System - a Meteoritic Study&amp;quot;. The Solar System formed from solar nebula about 4.6 Ga ago. Meteorites generally represent material left over from this earliest phase of solar system history, and give us insight into processes that occurred during the formation of planetary bodies. This study will investigate mixing of material within parts of the solar nebula via the detailed study of fragments of different meteorite types embedded within meteorite breccias, i.e. material accreted by impact to the surface of an unrelated asteroid. These fragments (&amp;quot;lithic clasts&amp;quot;) are pieces of a wide variety of meteorite types, including some that are different from any known meteorite type. A study of such material will greatly extend our knowledge of the varieties of planetesimals that existed in the early stages of planetary accretion. 

(3) &amp;quot;Constraining the Source Localities of Lunar Meteorites by Combining Spacecraft Remote Sensing Data with Laboratory Sample Analysis&amp;quot;. This project will combine lunar geochemical remote sensing data with laboratory-determined compositions of lunar meteorites to constrain the launch localities of the latter. This will enable the ages, petrography, minor- and trace-element compositions, and isotope geochemistry (all of which can be determined by laboratory analyses of the meteorites, but none of which cannot be determined by remote sensing alone) to be used to interpret the geological history of the individual launch localities on the Moon. The only other means of obtaining comparable information would be to target dedicated sample return missions to these localities, so exploring the extent to which lunar meteorites may yield comparable information on shorter timescales and at less expense is desirable before committing to such missions. 

All these projects fall within the high priority 'Science Challenges' identified by STFC, specifically 'Science Challenge B': How do stars and planetary systems develop and is life unique to our planet? A major subsidiary objective of our programme is the training of young scientists in these key areas of planetary science.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This programme is expected to have (non-academic) impact in two main areas:

(1) The public understanding of science. 

We are absolutely committed to enhancing the public understanding of planetary science. The principal applicant is a past president of the Society for Popular Astronomy (the largest public astronomy society in the UK), and gives a large number of media appearances (most recently appearing in &amp;quot;In Our Time&amp;quot; on Radio 4 on 3 November 2011 discussing lunar exploration). The applicants and the named PDRA all give a large number of public and school talks. Moreover, Birkbeck College is itself institutionally committed to public education (being that part of the University of London which caters for continuing higher education). Every opportunity will be taken to ensure that the results of this project are used to enhance the public understanding of planetary science in the UK. Specific opportunities/planned activities include:

(a) Continue to give public and school talks, and media interviews, whenever the opportunities arise. During the last 24 months the PI has given ten public and school talks, and six TV and radio interviews, and been cited in six newspaper articles on lunar and planetary science topics. During the same period the named PDRA has also given several public talks and is also the Project Leader for the Gillespie Science Club (an after-school hour long science club held at Gillespie Primary School in London which teaches children a variety of scientific subjects through running hands-on experiments). It is envisaged that these activities will continue at a similar rate, aided where appropriate by the Birkbeck Press Office.

(b) Produce popular articles describing our lunar work for publication in Popular Astronomy (the magazine of the Society for Popular Astronomy, of which the PI is a past President), and other similar publications (e.g. Astronomy Now and Sky at Night magazines; the Deputy Editor of the former, Dr Emily Baldwin, is a former PhD student in our group).

(c) In the area of lunar science, build on our involvement in the MoonZoo citizen science project to bring lunar science to a large number (very likely thousands) of interested members of the public. This web-based project presents a major opportunity to stimulate public interest in lunar science. Our group has been involved in the scientific definition of MoonZoo from the start and we will continue to actively support and develop it, for both scientific and outreach purposes.


(2) Knowledge exchange with industry.

Specific possibilities include:

(a) In the field of Mars exploration we are collaborating closely with MSSL on the design and fabrication of the ExoMars filter set. In the area of lunar exploration the PI led the development of the business case for possible UK involvement in the ESA 'Lunar Lander' mission, and this has led to the development of industrial contacts. Further collaboration with UK industry (e.g. Surrey Satellite Technologies Ltd and EADS-Astrium) on the design of space missions is likely. The industrial and economic benefits of innovative space missions such as these were highlighted by the UK Space Exploration Review in 2009.

(b) The PI has acted as an advisor to Green Metals plc (formerly British Titanium), and the Space Exploration Review, on a project to extract oxygen from lunar regolith in support of future exploration activities. It is intended that these contacts will continue.

(c) The PI is a member of a 'lunar and terrestrial drilling consortium' led by Logica which aims to exploit UK expertise in drilling technology for possible future lunar drilling initiatives. If future opportunities arise in the lunar drilling area we would aim to continue our involvement. 

(d) Our involvement in MoonZoo (http://moon.zooniverse.org/) will also facilitate knowledge exchange between lunar scientists and the software industry developing the Web servers and user interface tools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91236</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our funded PhD studentship has successfully met its main objective in constraining source localities for lunar meteorites, as reported in detail by Calzada-Diaz et al.
