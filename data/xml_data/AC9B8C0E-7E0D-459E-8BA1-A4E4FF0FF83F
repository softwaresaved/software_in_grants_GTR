The 5-year project will develop a US-UK Collaborative Partnership to cross pollinate PIs and students among 5 institutions to carry out the following objectives: 1) generate a 1000-taxon, 700-gene phylogeny of Bombycoidea to build a robust evolutionary framework; 2) quantify sensory morphology of 2 key organs (eye and antenna) that are central to insect vision and olfaction; and 3) reconstruct the evolutionary history of genes in the visual and olfactory transduction networks to test whether sensory morphology and selection on relevant genes changes between species that are active during the day or night.

Nearly all animals utilize vision or olfaction as a primary sensory system. It has been presumed that species' shifts between being active in light or dark environments drives sensory organ morphology and selection on relevant genes. However, this central hypothesis remains largely untested, because a comprehensive evolutionary framework and comparative data have been largely lacking. Bombycoidea are one of the most conspicuous groups of Lepidoptera. They provide an excellent opportunity to study how 2 potentially complementary sensory systems, vision and olfaction, have evolved at day/night transitions, because species in the group have distinct activity times, diverse eye and antennal morphologies and advanced sensory gene networks. The superfamily includes many model organisms (e.g. Bombyx mori, Manduca sexta) that serve pivotal roles in studies on genetics, physiology and development. They are also economically important and are frequently used as educational tools because of their large size, charisma, and ease in rearing. The availability of several whole-genome bombycoid sequences provides a unique opportunity to target sensory gene families that cannot be studied in many other invertebrate groups. Despite their central role in science and outreach, Bombycoidea still lacks a robust phylogeny. With our collaborative research teams in the US and UK, we will assemble the largest molecular dataset for this superfamily and construct a phylogeny of 1000 species. Our 700-gene anchored enrichment probe set has been designed and tested for both ethanol and recently-collected dry specimens, and can be applied broadly across the order with high success, thereby making this tool useful to the broader phylogenetics community.

The broader impacts have 3 goals: (1) Provide data and tools for the enhancement of science. The molecular data and the new phylogeny will open the door to extensive comparative character and gene-evolution analyses of a major model group within one of the largest diversifications of holometabolous insects. Our ODORS toolkit, designed to search for olfactory genes, is the first of its kind for non-model organisms, and will be extremely valuable to the scientific community. Data and results will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community via online aggregates and databases. (2) Promote interest and train students at all levels and diverse backgrounds. We will train 2 postdocs, 2 grad students, 11 undergrads, and dozens of school students. We will enhance scientific literacy in STEM programs by targeting minority students and by integrating younger students who are still developing concepts about the natural world. We will also conduct workshops on phylogenomics, imaging, and gene evolution. (3) Educate the broader community through museum-based outreach. We will: (a) Hold an annual 'Moth Sort' event at FLMNH; (b) Develop a museum exhibit focused on bombycoid diversity and sensory systems at UF, BYU and NHM; and (c) Create a &amp;quot;night at the museum&amp;quot; experience by opening the McGuire Center's Butterfly Rainforest at night to allow visitors with headlamps to see large bombycoid moths in flight.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Research results will be communicated to the general academic community via publication of peer reviewed papers in international journals and presentations at international conferences (both posters and talks). Data collected during the course of the project will be made publicly available through the Natural History Museum (NHM) data portal and data depository (data.nhm.ac.uk) and other public databases as appropriate.

The NHM has a proactive Press Office that has considerable experience engaging with both the national and international media and coordinating publicity between multiple institutional press offices. Press Office staff will be able to assist drafting and release of press releases in conjunction with other investigators/institutions to coincide with publication of significant research results, thereby ensuring dissemination of the work to the widest possible public audience, both nationally and internationally. The PDRA will attend NHM and NERC-run Media Training courses to develop effective public engagement. With regard to public and educational outreach, NHM has a highly successful Visitor Experience, Learning and Outreach Department whose programmes will be able to deliver the results of this research to a wide variety of users, including both formal (National Curriculum, Key Stage 1-5) and informal learners, in a proven and effective manner.

With regard to formal learning, outcomes from this research will be incorporated into presentations, seminars and museum collections-based activities at all levels, including KS1-2, KS3-4 GCSE Biology and science students and KS5 A-level biological science students. We will also seek KS5 students for short-term (1-2 weeks) work experience placements to undertake collections-based projects related to the ongoing recuration of the bombycoid collections of the NHM.

More informal learning opportunities include incorporation of research results into the NHM's 'Nature Live' series of public interactions. These take place daily several times a week (twice daily at weekends and in UK school holidays), are of 30 minutes duration, and are themed around the NHM's exhibitions. They focus on aspects of NHM science output in an informal setting and allow the public direct access to scientists. Nature Live presentations are attended by diverse audiences, representing all socio-demographic groups in the UK, and international visitors to the NHM are also able to attend. The NHM also participates in the &amp;quot;Science Uncovered&amp;quot; event held in September, funded by the European Commission as part of the European Researchers' Night project and the results of the research will be incorporated into presentations and activities as appropriate. Progress and results will also be announced via the NHM's social media sites.

Such outreach activities at the NHM will be conducted by the PI and PDRA in conjunction with the NHM's team of professional science educators. With regard to training and personal development, the PDRA and UG students will be introduced to a wide range of public outreach events as participants and will be guided in these activities by the NHM Science Communication Team.

During the course of this project, the NHM will be running two relevant new exhibitions, &amp;quot;Colour and Vision&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Life in the Dark&amp;quot;. The objectives and results of the proposed research will be integrated into the content of both exhibitions. The NHM is also establishing new &amp;quot;pop-up&amp;quot; events in the galleries that allow further direct interaction between the public and scientists, including the &amp;quot;Lates&amp;quot; series targeting adult audiences, whic typically attract three to five thousand people in a single night. We will develop such an event in conjunction with staff from the NHM's Public Engagement Group themed to showcase the results and significance of the proposed research.

Members of the research team also write popular articles for publication in the NHM's members' magazines, &amp;quot;evolve&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Wild World&amp;quot;.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240776</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P003915/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CC10CC12-1D16-48BD-8F66-6A64A651DEAB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gene action &amp; regulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A4209D5A-2E41-4290-9D1A-3172C1F48962</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Population Genetics/Evolution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2CF6994C-A1AE-435B-853C-2C228927BC9E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systematics &amp; Taxonomy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>20FF6FDE-28DB-4D9D-99E6-8470C745EA60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transcriptomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
