&lt;p>This study will compile and incorporate information on assortativity from a wide range of sociological and economic studies to analyse the character and strength of assortativity of interactions made by people in modern Britain. By incorporating this extra information into models of contagion this study will considerably improve the understanding of observed patterns of infectious disease within communities, how they may be best controlled in terms of efficacy and resources, and to robustly inform public-health policy.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is considerable interest in the development of mechanistic models of social interactions or to parameterize social networks, primarily from the need to improve predictive mathematical models of infection spread. This work has direct impact on public-health policy; for example the age-structured POLYMOD study (Mossong 2008) has been extensively used to help inform vaccination policy in the UK and elsewhere. We envisage that our study will have similar benefits, allowing us to substantially improve the models used to predict the impact of policy. While the application and data of the research are UK-focussed, the methodology and modelling approaches are applicable to any population: academic researchers and allied health professionals from a range of countries where similar data is available would find this work directly relevant to their research and policy-advisory tools. 

We will ensure health professionals are aware of our work through publication in high impact academic journals, presentation of the work at an international conference, and through the team's direct links with researchers in the Health Protection Agency (to be Public Health England), and government advisory bodies such as the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee. Given that vaccination and other public-health policy is under continual review and change is common, we believe our work will be have an ongoing important impact on health policy. The general public will therefore benefit indirectly through improved models of social interactions contributing towards better infectious disease control.

In addition, beyond the modelling of infection, our work will help to generate important insights into the spread and maintenance of opinions, beliefs and behaviours within the UK. This would be helpful in understanding and possibly changing a range of health-relevant behaviours such as cessation of smoking, diet and lifestyle choices, and refusal to accept vaccination or treatment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159618</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Public Health England (formerly: Health Protection Agency)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Public Health England</gtr:description><gtr:id>10F5BE7E-F0E8-4FE0-A942-D4CF8FEF0262</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications:

We are in communication with Public Health England regarding our findings as well as their data and analysis needs for modelling of infectious diseases. We have also been in communication with the equivalent organisation in the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to make them aware of our work and the potential for a similar study using US data.

We are currently preparing two manuscripts arising from this work: the first will describe the systematic identification of data sources and to make the modelling community aware of the information available to parameterise models of society; the second will present the findings from the detailed household model of disease transmission.

Methodologies developed during this project will be used in two forthcoming PhD projects: (1) a NIHR funded Health Protection Research Unit studentship developing mathematical models of susceptibility and infection in England and Wales, for use in outbreak scenario planning; (2) an ESRC Advanced Quantitative Methods studentship will develop statistical methods and simulation approaches to model Malawian population and society from census and other information.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>732CD3E1-8389-4B39-9A8A-3E3BBBC95D47</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have conducted an extensive search of surveys and other other publicly-available data sources to identify information relating to the social interaction of individuals. In total, we identified and reviewed 147 publicly-available information sources, of which we identified 44 which have directly relevant information. These identified data sources will be of immediate use for researchers wishing to model the structure of society and social interactions, in particular to model the spread and control of infectious diseases.

Our analysis focused on 3 studies with direct information about social interactions, and 8 information sources which contained detailed information regarding co-location of individuals (which types of people tend to interact or share common space). Of these 8, we conducted extensive analysis of 4 studies which are large studies of co-habitation and describe which types of people live with each other. 

We devised a framework of individual attributes and characteristics with which to amalgamate information from different sources and studies in a consistent manner. Data were collated under this framework to produce a very large data-set of sampled households, the individuals who live in each household, and various attributes of those individuals and their households. These individual attributes include the age, sex ethnicity and occupation of individuals. For households, attributes include the number of people living in the household as well as information such as number of bedrooms -- information which has previously not been incorporated into mathematical models of epidemics, yet may have a great impact on the transmission dynamics of certain infections, such as influenza.

Using the collated data-set, we developed a realistic mathematical simulation model of social interactions and transmission of infection within and between households. With this model, we have shown that striking inequalities in disease risk arise naturally as a consequence of the choices people make in who they live with.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work will be of interest to many researchers attempting to model infectious disease transmission and control (including the cost-benefit analysis of new vaccine policies) within Great Britain.

To this end, we will make available demographic-attribute based 'mixing' matrices for a variety of attributes. These tables describe the probability of individuals of different demography cohabiting or co-locating, and are based on secondary analysis of identified data sources. They will be presented in a form suitable for modellers to 'plug-in' to existing models. We anticipate that they will be considered for use by the modelling teams at Public Health England.

These matrices will be useful for research beyond the realm of infectious disease modelling, in that they will be available and relevant to any researcher attempting to characterise contagious processes within Britain; we anticipate they will be important for modelling the influence of peers on lifestyles and health (such as smoking and obesity) as well as the spread and maintenance of political and other beliefs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>22D9A7D3-46DC-45F6-B0C8-C27D7016960C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports,
