Through discussion, debate and presentations of research results, OPHI and collaborators will engage in the process of discussing the (improved) indicators that will measure poverty in all its dimensions in the new Sustainable Development Goals. This work, in turn, will have a direct economic and social impact on global poverty. This proposal thus responds to a unique moment in time when actors are determining the indicators to measure the Sustainable Development Goals.

The uptake of the ESRC-DFID sponsored research at the national level led to OPHI being awarded the International Impact award by ESRC last year. This proposal moves the ESRC-DFIC grant's targeted impact audience from national level policy makers to the international level, where the United Nations Statistics Division has convened an inter agency expert working group to define the indicators that will measure poverty (among other topics) over the next 15 years as part of the Sustainable Development Objectives (SDGs). More specifically, the target audiences include the UN Statistics Division and the Governments that make it up; the Inter-Agency Expert Working Group on SDG Indicators, the World Bank, the lead agency focused on global poverty measurement (which is itself considering new global poverty indicators with OPHI as an Advisor on its commission); the Foreign Affairs Offices and UN Missions of selected countries and key stakeholders in global poverty measurement such as the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. 

The crucial time for this debate, discussion and decision-making is between September and March 2016. We plan to communicate this body of research to these audiences in order to educate the debate and decision-making on measuring poverty within the SDGs. The specific activities planned include: 

- Join with governments in the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network in a Side Event at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the new global MPI and its relevance as an indicator in the SDGs. 
- Disseminate the new OPHI authored OUP book to the target audiences and promote seminar discussions with statisticians at the UN and World Bank. 
- One-on-one discussions with key figures at the World Bank, the UN, National UN representatives and key non-state stakeholders (such as the SDSN) to discuss the research findings and their relevance.
- At least two meetings of a working group of MPPN countries to discuss the research findings and how to broaden the discussion to Foreign Ministries, national UN Missions and statisticians and others involved in the SDG Indicator process.
- With its MPPN partner countries hold a side event at the UN Statistics Commission Annual Meeting in March 2016. This side event could be essential in the UN debate and decision making process on indicators.
- Throughout this grant period, OPHI will prepare and disseminate results packaged for these research users through appropriate channels.

These specific activities would benefit the technical staff, statisticians and evidence-based policy makers who would emerge with better knowledge of and understanding of the multidimensional poverty measurement methodologies and their practicality for policy. This would give them the tools needed as they set the indicators for the new SDGs.

If the results of OPHI's research were to be adopted by the UN, it would transform the way the world not only views but also deals with poverty in an integrated and multi-sectoral manner, informing national public policies over the next few decades. The impact would be on the extreme poor at a global level.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our goal is to transform the way the United Nations and related international institutions view and measure poverty, in all countries. The best way to understand this is to compare what we are proposing with the complementary indicator of poverty: the $1.25 a day extreme poverty income standard set by the World Bank, then by the Millennium Development Goals 15 years ago. For years this income line has defined extreme poverty. Every country in the world was held to that minimum standard and most mobilized resources and activated policies to eradicate extreme income poverty. Our research has found that countries can do the same to tackle multidimensional poverty - the multiple deprivations that people suffer at the same time. These might include lack of education, lack of health care, malnutrition, lack of safe drinking water and poor housing. What we are placing before the international community is the need for a minimum standard of multidimensional poverty to be established within the Sustainable Development Goals, parallel to the $1.25 income poverty measure. Our and others' research has clearly shown that this complementary measure often differs from income poverty levels and trends to income poverty, because different policies affect it. Thus creating a new headline measure for poverty also creates incentives for integrated policies to tackle non-monetary deprivations. 

OPHI has developed a methodology for measuring multidimensional poverty in order to track and energise progress towards reducing it. If this were to be adopted in the SDGs, it would transform the way the world not only views but deals with poverty, informing national public policies in most countries over the next few years. The impact would be on the extreme poor at a global level. Those who are poor because of multiple deprivations in education, health, housing, nutrition, and services would no longer be dismissed, forgotten, or visible only as part of a large and complex dashboard. 

The impact would thus be on the poor, on governments and on those international agencies and NGOs working on poverty. The specific activities contemplated in the grant application would benefit the technical staff, statisticians and evidence-based policy makers who would benefit from a better knowledge of and understanding of the multidimensional poverty measurement methodologies and their practicality for policy. Much of the specific activities contemplated are aimed at this group so that they may have the tools needed as they set the indicators for the new SDGs.

How will these groups benefit? The target audiences will benefit through increased awareness and knowledge of these new methodologies. Governments will benefit by having clear international standards for multidimensional as well as income extreme poverty. The poor will benefit because over time, poverty programs would change to meet this new, more realistic definition of poverty-and to meet the global standard set by the United Nations.

The involvement of the MPPN in this project will help to insure its impact. The MPPN is a network of 40 countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America focused on reducing poverty through multidimensional poverty measurement and programs. These countries also are very involved in helping to have multidimensional poverty measurement in the SDGs. They will be active participants throughout this project. The impact will therefore also be on the MPPN, strengthening it as an organization that is quickly growing. Our expectation is that each m member country will deepen its understanding and therefore commitment to multidimensional poverty measurement.

We have found that the pathway to impact combines technical knowledge and political will. The MPPN brings both Statisticians and Policymakers into the debate. Their active participation will help impact the World Bank and the UN. They in turn will be impacted by this work at the international level.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>70560</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MPPN Annual Meeting 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B5C0352-395D-41B6-AE50-69040C3E190E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Annual Meeting of the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network - with high-level (Ministerial) participation from some 30 countries - in the summer of 2015 was important as it culminated in a communique where MPPN members endorse and call for the Global MPI to be included as part of the SDG indicator framework.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Special Side Event at the UN General Assembly</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3FC488CC-92DB-470B-821F-973CF32912ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To an audience of more than 40 high level government representatives, including several Heads of Stae, the event showed the importance of embedding a multidimensional measure of poverty within the new framework.

The event was entitled 'Anchoring a Global Multidimensional Poverty Index within the SDGs' and included contributions from two Presidents, two Prime Ministers, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and several ministers (the complete list of speakers is available below). The event celebrated the sea-change embodied within the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which recognise that 'eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions' is 'the greatest global challenge'.
 
The distinguished event speakers are at the forefront of practical efforts to reduce all forms of poverty. They shared with passion and commitment their work to address poverty, using Multidimensional Poverty Indices (MPIs) that catalyse integrated policies and disaggregated data to leave no one behind. Many calls were also made for an internationally comparable Global MPI to be a tier 1 indicator within the SDGs and for National MPIs, that measure poverty according to national definitions, to be aspirational indicators for Target 1.2. 

The event discussion was fast-paced, focused and substantive. President Solis of Costa Rica called for a poverty narrative that inspires commitment and action - by government, but also by civil society and the private sector. Prime Minister Tobgay of Bhutan shared how multidimensional poverty and well-being measures create an insightful measurement framework for multi-level policy and programme design. President Hernandez of Honduras shared a compelling example of a campesino farmer whose life is trapped in a battery of interlocking deprivations, but also observed how the Global MPI enables Honduras to be compared on the world stage to countries in Asia and the Arab world. Prime Minister Anthony of St Lucia brought in Bob Marley to call for attention to the hidden, forgotten, and isolated people and the links between poverty and environmental degradation.
In the Ministerial Discussion, Arsenio Balisacan (Philippines) shared how their multidimensional poverty measures - which are incorporated in their national development plan - better reflected the impact of economic growth, while Tayana Orozco (Colombia) shared a distilled and compact overview of Colombia's many-layered innovative policy uses of the MPI. Jeff Radebe (South Africa) stressed how measures that display the interlinkages of poverty can stimulate and guide integrated policy, and also mentioned how South Africa's census-based MPI was a 'precision measure of poverty' that interested many. Marcos Barraza (Chile) shared the structure and findings of Chile's official National MPI launched in January 2015, and Dang Huy Dong (Vietnam) explained the need to have a 'headline' indicator of multidimensional poverty to give visibility to social progress. Cecilia Vaca Jones (Ecuador), whose country will shortly release a national MPI, articulated how it resonated with the indigenous cosmology of Buen Vivir, of harmony between peoples, and with the environment. Savas Alpay (Islamic Development Bank) described the interest in Islamic Development Bank member countries in building national MPIs, and of their work in supporting capacity building in statistical offices.
In a closing set of brief remarks as well as submitted statements, other important points emerged. Mikheil Janelidze (Georgia) shared how MPI is a natural next step given their history of social policy interventions. Maria Luisa Navarro (Panama) charted Panama's trajectory which has spawned an interest in multidimensional poverty measurement. Amadou Ba (Senegal) shared their work on building a national MPI - the first in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Tarek Nabulsi (League of Arab States) described the need in the Arab region for a comparable MPI, but one focused on moderate poverty, and their collaboration with UNESCWA to bring this into being. Ingolf Dietrich (Germany) articulated Germany's interest in following how multidimensional poverty metrics are evolving, and Noam Unger (USAID) shared how USAID's new vision for extreme poverty is, for the first time, multidimensional. Mexico, the country who had released their National MPI even before UNDP's Global MPI launch in 2010, closed the session, and welcomed participants to come to the next meeting of the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (mppn.org), which will be hosted by Mexico.

On 7 March 2016, OPHI and the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN) hosted a Side Event at the 47th session of the United Nations Statistical Commission in New York. The Commission is the key UN statistical entity, with participation from national and international statistical leaders from across the world. The very first agenda item at this session is the indicator framework to be used for measuring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). For OPHI and the MPPN, this Side Event was a good opportunity to share countries' experiences with multidimensional poverty measurement.

The side event brought together an overflowing room of participants, among them many leading statisticians at the forefront of innovations in poverty measurement, to discuss and share experiences with using multidimensional poverty measures for analysing poverty and as a governance tool for targeting, monitoring, and coordination of poverty reduction programmes.

Overall, the participants strongly highlighted the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) as a tool that can rigorously measure poverty in all its dimensions and fulfil SDG indicator 1.2.2.

The side event was chaired by Pali Lehohla, Statistician-General for South Africa and a Steering Committee member of the MPPN. Directors of statistics from Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia, as well as the Director of OPHI presented their ongoing work to measure and reduce multidimensional poverty. Comments from the floor were contributed by directors of statistics from Cuba, Egypt, Peru, Philippines (deputy), Morocco, and a representative from UNICEF. Participants described their multidimensional poverty indices and how these have interfaced with the policy process as tools of good governance.

Mauricio Perfetti (Colombia): Colombia's MPI, launched in 2011, is updated annually based on 15 indicators that draw on 25 minutes' worth of survey questions. Strong reductions in the MPI were generated by proactively designing and monitoring social public policy. Census data is used to create high-resolution poverty maps.

Jos&amp;eacute; Rosero (Ecuador): Launched in February 2016 by President Correa, Ecuador's MPI measures poverty and extreme poverty annually using rights drawn from the concept of Buen Vivir. The MPI reduced by over one-third between 2009 and 2015, and will be used for policy planning. Ecuador's National Institute of Statistics (INEC) has infographics, methods, and results online.

Julio Santaella (Mexico): Mexico released their national multidimensional measure in 2009. Mexico's pioneering index, which is updated every two years with all statistical codes and data freely available online, provides disaggregated information and is proactively used for state and national programming and coordination.

Aboubacar Sedikh Beye (Senegal): Senegal is preparing a National MPI to support the national plan of 'Emerging Senegal'. It will also become a centre of excellence and training in the production and dissemination of Multidimensional Poverty Statistics for Francophone Africa.

Pali Lehohla (South Africa): The South African MPI (SAMPI) uses census data from 2001 and 2011 to track reductions in the poverty rate and intensity. Job creation was a priority clearly articulated in KwaZulu-Natal, where a citizen satisfaction survey was conducted to tackle the question of matching MPI's design to people's values and priorities.

Hedi Saidi (Tunisia): Tunisia's census-based MPI, which is currently being finalised, reflects the country's post-revolutionary plan 2016-20 in which youth unemployment is a priority, and voice matters. The MPI design process engaged stakeholders in government, civil society, and academia.

Sabina Alkire (OPHI &amp;amp; GWU): The MPI complements dashboards by focusing on people who face several deprivations simultaneously. The headline statistic can be unpacked into clear, policy-relevant parts, becoming a useful tool for policy. The methodology is flexible and open-source, and both national and comparable MPIs add value to existing monetary poverty measures.

Insightful reflections from the floor were offered from Damar Maceo Cruz (Cuba), regarding Cuba's MPI; AbouBakr El Gendy (Egypt) on Egypt's trajectory of poverty analysis; An&amp;iacute;bal S&amp;aacute;nchez Aguilar (Peru), on a recently-launched process to design a Peruvian MPI; Romeo S. Recide (Philippines) on their process of making the MPI a reference statistic; Belkacem Abdous (Morocco), on their work linking multidimensional poverty and human development; and Martin Evans (UNICEF), on a child poverty measure that is linked to the MPI.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A139E45B-6203-427A-A96A-307A9D4DC6EE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A new method for measuring multidimensional poverty, developed with the help of an ESRC-DFID grant, has been adopted by governments and organisations around the world to improve the effectiveness of poverty-reduction programmes. This six-month grant has enabled OPHI and the MPPN to further boost this impact by supporting the voice and leadership of countries using MPIs, and influencing the way that the United Nations and other international institutions measure and report on poverty. The UN Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in September 2015, have as the first goal to 'End poverty in all its forms everywhere,' which is an implicit endorsement of the multidimensional nature of poverty and the need for appropriate, multidimensional measures. Moreover, indicator 1.2 of the SDGs calls on countries to ' reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions,' illustrating again the impact of OPHI's transformational efforts. OPHI and the MPPN, have successfully engaged UN and other international events and conferences to share expertise and encourage policymakers and statisticians from across the world to explore multidimensional poverty measures. The World Bank may also be on the verge of changing its approach to poverty measurement and reporting. The World Bank's Commission on Global Poverty, set up by its Chief Economist Kaushik Basu in June 2015, is expected to deliver its report in late April 2016. OPHI Director Sabina Alkire is on the Commission's advisory board.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Through the work of the MPPN we provide a strong coordinated voice for inclusion of multidimensional poverty analysis in the SDGs and their indicators, as well as in other relevant international institutions such as the World Bank. OPHI also aims to educate policymakers and statisticians on the potential of both national and comparable or global MPIs to track poverty changes over the next 15 years. Moreover, OPHI annual summer schools and occasional intensive two-week training courses provide methodological and practical capacity building for high-calibre participants from across the world. Many of the course participants come from statistics offices and international organizations. One intensive training course was held in Dakar, Senegal, in December 2015, in collaboration with the Islamic Development Bank, the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation and the Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Centre for Islamic Countries.
