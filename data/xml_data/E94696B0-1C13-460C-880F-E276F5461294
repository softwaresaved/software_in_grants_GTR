Individual machines are usually composed of a number of proteins that work together to perform one of the cell's functions in life, and determine its ability to survive and replicate. Understanding how individual machines function is crucial because when these machines breakdown the consequences can be catastrophic. For example, some cancers can be attributed directly to the failure of machines that process the genetic information (DNA) of a cell. In addition, invading microorganisms such as viruses bring their own machines that subvert or destroy a cell as it is hijacked for the pathogen's own advantage. The identification and understanding of how these machines function can therefore be a starting point for combating such disease states. 
The biosciences can inspire nanotechnology, which aims to develop small mechanical devices based on protein machines that can be harnessed to drive or modulate molecular processes from which we benefit. Significant examples are found in biotechnology, such as emerging nanopore DNA sequencing devices that can operate at the single molecule level. The precise understanding of cellular nanomachines at the atomic level is absolutely dependent on the availability of precise structural information. For large molecular assemblies this information comes from X-ray structural analysis and, for very large assemblies, it is vastly assisted by powerful electron microscopes that can image single particles. Alone, electron microscopy can guide our understanding, but for the most part lacks the resolving power to provide critical detail. E1, the protein that we will study, is from a large group of pathogens, the papillomaviruses that cause warts and cancer in animals and man. Papillomavirus-derived diseases are of significant health and economic importance. E1 is often referred to as a &amp;quot;motor protein&amp;quot; that forms a six membered (hexameric) ring-like assembly, a machine that unwinds the two strands of the DNA molecule during replication (reproduction) of viral DNA. It can be viewed as a small radial engine that can move along DNA and separate its two strands and as such is a prototypic nanomachine and important target for drugs that could inhibit viral replication and disease.
Here we aim to understand how the E1 machine unwinds DNA. The objectives are to carry out detailed X-ray structural studies on E1 to determine its overall structure and how it interacts with DNA. We intend to verify these results and test models of function with complementary biochemical and biophysical studies. As a leading tractable model, it has great promise for being the first hexameric DNA-unwinding machine that we fully understand. The potential applications of our work include formulating strategies to target E1 and related helicases through structure based drug design. They will help understand replication processes in our own cells that are more complex and challenging to define. There are potential applications in nanobiotechnology and in medicine. Consequently, we envision that our studies will have a wide impact, with health benefits and improved living and economic standards nationally and internationally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>How hexameric helicases unwind dsDNA is unknown but an &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; mechanism of action assumes that the enzyme makes functional interactions with the replication fork junction (RFJ) to induce dsDNA melting. Structures of the papillomavirus E1 helicase domain (E1HD, residues ~300-605) have provided models for ssDNA translocation. We have now acquired a low-resolution structure of an intact E1 complex by electron microscopy (EM) showing an interconnected network of tunnels and chambers in its N-terminus (residues ~1-300). We also have an X-ray structure of E1HD bound to a RFJ-DNA substrate showing splitting of the dsDNA at the entrance to the C-terminal helicase domain. Accordingly, we hypothesise that the E1 N-terminus forms conduits for ssDNA and dsDNA and that the junction with the E1HD represents an active sites for DNA melting. Consequently, the E1 helicase is an active base pair separation machine.
The objectives are: (i) to obtain high resolution X-ray structural information for the E1HD bound to a RFJ-like DNA substrate. (ii) To test mechanistic models of dsDNA melting by site directed mutagenesis in combination with assays for E1 DNA binding, oligomerisation, ATPase and helicase activity. (iii) To obtain X-ray structural information for the uncharacterised N-terminal domain of the protein, map E1 surfaces involved in domain-domain interactions by NMR and provide corroborating biochemical and biophysical data for structure and activity of protein assemblies incorporating the E1 N-terminus, with and without DNA. (iv) Integrate all available high-resolution structural information to generate an accurate structure of E1. We should then be able to understand all protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and deduce a model for DNA unwinding. This could be tested further by site directed mutagenesis and will inform future experiments to probe catalytic events in detail using single molecule techniques and mechanistic enzymology.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries and interested parties:

Papillomaviruses are important disease organisms and their replication proteins are key therapeutic targets. Even though vaccines are available to HPVs that cause cancer, viral chemotheraphy is particularly relevant for the HPVs that cause genital warts (low risk of progression to cervical cancer), which currently cost Western health agencies much more to treat than cervical cancer. In the farm industry, BPV infection causes teat papillomatosis that can affect milk production and rearing of young animals. BPV infection also causes equine sarcoids where genital infection interferes with breeding programs. This is particularly important in the third-world where there is a greater reliance on these animals for work and food. Although BPV vaccines are available there are similar issues as with HPV vaccines concerning the lack of protection against all serotypes and their unaffordability in developing nations. Although there is a drive in Western nations to reduce the drugs given to reared animals in the food chain, economic arguments make this harder to justify in developing nations. Interested parties may also include government policy makers who determine levels of overseas aid and third sector organizations, such as the Horserace Betting Levy Board (veterinary science and animal wellbeing).

Potential impact of the proposed work:
It will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of DNA replication in a key model system. Helicases are important therapeutic targets in cancer and viral diseases but remain poorly understood. This is a protein structure-function study and atomic structures coupled with functional data can facilitate a rational approach to drug design. The prospect that this and any new data emerging from our studies can be applied immediately is realistic. Anti-papillomavirus drugs would have a direct impact on national health and reduce the financial burden on public health resources. Similar arguments apply to the cattle, dairy and equine industries whose commercial viabilities are enhanced when disease-free. Pharmaceutical companies that develop anti-viral drugs would derive wealth from anti-viral products. Many pharma companies have a significant research, development and production base in the UK. There is also the potential for patentable results as small molecule inhibitors and assays for screening therapeutic agents could evolve from these studies. 
There will also be benefits from the continued training of postdoctoral research fellows and the development of their professional skills and creativity that could be integrated into any commercial or academic enterprise requiring a highly skilled structural biologist or protein biochemist. Many of the skills that will develop, such as time management, team working, communication and technical, are also transferable between employment sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>335364</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Viral replication Sheffield</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C1A8582-0F78-4B56-A982-920CCFE4014C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications:

In humans these viruses cause warts but are also estimated to be responsible for up to 5% of all cancers, most notably cervical cancer. We are using a technique known as X-ray crystallography to reveal the structure of the protein at the highest level of detail - atomic resolution. We are studying how the protein interacts with its substrates in order to understand the reactions that it performs. This is necessary because it can help us identify how we could prevent the protein from working, for example by targeting part of the structure with a drug that binds and inhibits its function. The protein we are studying, E1, is a DNA helicase. It separates the two individual strands that make up DNA, the molecule that conveys the genetic information that encodes for life, during cell replication. Separation of the two DNA strands by the helicase generates a replication fork with a double-stranded and two single-stranded components.
We succeeded in obtaining diffraction quality crystals for the E1 helicase complex with DNA. Although these crystals diffract to a medium ~3.5 &amp;Aring; resolution, the electron density shows how the papillomavirus E1 helicase binds a DNA replication fork during DNA unwinding. Our experimental data indicate that there is variation in the position of single stranded segments, precluding identification of individual nucleotides. Nevertheless, the data indicate how each arm of the DNA fork is engaged with the E1 protein suggesting possible mechanisms of strand separation. This is the first time that structure of the E1 helicase complex with DNA fork has been obtained for proteins like E1. We have also altered (mutated) key residues in the E1 protein at the principal sites of protein-DNA interactions. The biochemical activity of these altered proteins sheds further light on models for DNA unwinding that can be proposed on the basis of structural observations. Our results are important because proteins very similar to E1 are involved in DNA replication in all forms of life including humans. Breakdown of these machines in our own cells can result in serious disorders such as cancer. As a result of our research, understanding of the fundamental process of DNA replication has developed and we can now present new models on how helicases like E1 in our own cells may function.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Detailed structural information for an intact papillomavirus helicase complex bound to DNA could assist in the design and validation of chemical inhibitors (drug-like molecules) that may progress to effective therapies for viral disease. The information is of great significance to researchers that are studying helicase proteins that do the same job as the E1 helicase in human cells. So far, the additional complexity of these has prevented their detailed characterisation. Lack of fundamental knowledge about the structure and mechanism slows the development of therapeutic applications, such as those based on inhibiting helicase action. Our current data serve as a firm stepping stone for further research on the E1 helicase mechanism, suggesting approaches for obtaining E1 complexes with more uniformly bound DNA, for improving the resolution of structural analysis. Our findings will inform other researchers working on DNA motor proteins who could benefit from using similar biochemical and structural approaches in their research. 
The E1 helicase is a small &amp;quot;nanomachine&amp;quot;. Our work could also have a significant impact in synthetic biology and bionanotechnology that utilize or exploit molecular machines based on cellular systems. In the case of E1 this could be direct, or through the exploitation or adaptation of its operating principles that we can now better understand.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>80D9CF34-DFD4-46EE-861C-A6EB576317BF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B1910698-76E6-44F6-AF32-869872AD221B"><gtr:id>B1910698-76E6-44F6-AF32-869872AD221B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural basis for DNA strand separation by a hexameric replicative helicase.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4d97270398ab4559fc7c64695e661704"><gtr:id>4d97270398ab4559fc7c64695e661704</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chaban Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/K01921X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02FE9751-1497-4DFD-B349-D4A9C96538E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1163A5D2-CE35-4C7E-904E-6FB2B5FA0C2A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Multiprotein complexes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F14C04A0-571D-4298-AEAC-AEC5A0A9DB7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Structural Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
