A study of legally binding separation agreements and private ordering in family law in Scotland</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J004960/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Scots family law provides detailed legislation which regulates the sharing of property and finances on the breakdown of marriage, civil partnership and, to a limited extent, cohabitation, but increasingly couples opt instead to regulate the consequences of relationship breakdown by agreement. It is thought that there is widespread use of such agreements but very little is known about them, their content and outcomes, the negotiation process, the role of legal advisers or the extent to which the parties may feel that they are bargaining ?within the shadow of the law?.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Separation agreements take the form of legally binding Minutes of Agreement. These are registered and stored in the National Archives of Scotland and accordingly they are public documents. This research will study a sample of agreements registered in 2010, followed up by interviews with parties and solicitors who have been involved in drafting agreements. It will be of considerable importance to lawyers, policymakers and individuals who are themselves involved in such private ordering.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will be of benefit to policy makers, family lawyers, mediators and, ultimately if not immediately, individuals who are personally involved in family disputes.

1. Policy makers 
The research will be of interest to policy makers in Scotland and beyond, providing for their need for evidence-based policy making and evaluation, for policy learning and innovation. The preference of many couples for private agreement rather than court action means that there is little evidence of how family law works in practice making this research valuable to legal policy makers within the Scottish government and the Scottish Law Commission. It will be of benefit to policy makers outwith Scotland. For example, the major family justice review now underway by the Ministry of Justice in England and Wales has shown an interest in the use of out of court, legally binding agreements, especially in light of the growing importance there of pre-nuptial and post-nuptial contracts. 

Recent government consultation and statutory reforms have emphasised the importance of having family law provisions which reflect changing family life and the needs and expectations of those who are affected by them, as in, for example, the consultation currently underway by the (English and Welsh) Law Commission on Marital Property Agreements. While the formal provisions of legislation may be scrutinised against social change, the clear indication is that the great majority of individuals choose to use private agreements rather than litigation as a means of resolving family problems and it is therefore of considerable importance for the future development of policy to know what is being agreed and why individuals are using agreements rather than resorting to court-based solutions, and with what effects. 

Family law and policy in recent years, while recognising the importance of private ordering and seeking to ensure that statutory provisions encourage and accommodate such private agreements, has had little opportunity to take account of how agreements operate in practice. There may be a mismatch between the formal legal framework, which is relatively little used, and the informal agreements being made in practice. The absence of focused research on the extent and nature of private agreements has meant that evaluation of family law reforms is not fully evidenced and the proposed research will contribute to a greater understanding of current practice.

Family law, although within the realm of private law, is closely linked to key areas of public law and policy. Thus, insight into the operation of private agreements will be relevant to other policy areas such as housing, childcare, family welfare and equal opportunities. It will produce information as to the private arrangements for accommodation and financial support of family members after the breakdown of adult relationships, and is therefore likely to be of interest, e.g., to housing planners and policy makers with responsibility for policies relating to family income and child poverty.

2. Family lawyers and mediators
There have been changes in the practice of family law in recent years, with greater focus on mediation and collaborative law. While arguments are made in favour of negotiated and consensual approaches to the resolution of family disputes, there is little research against which to assess the benefits of these approaches. This research will produce evidence of practitioners' perspectives on private agreements, and will highlight the use and impact of different types of legal advice and practice and contribute to future developments in family law practice, mediation services and civil legal aid.

This research fits clearly within the ESRC's theme of Influencing Change and Informing Behaviour as it contributes to a greater understanding of the process of private ordering, the influences behind engagement with it and its outcomes and the impact of changing legal practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74402</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interim report</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3FDC11E-3553-4B41-B417-AACC79D28508</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of interim findings Invited presentation of interim findings to interested policymakers.
