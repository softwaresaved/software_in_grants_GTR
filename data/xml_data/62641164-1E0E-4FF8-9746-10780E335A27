However, despite its pervasiveness across multiple scientific, educational and popular contexts, this technology remains little known to the European public. Moreover, though surviving magic lantern slides provide a massive, pan-European repository of heritage materials, encapsulating in visual form almost every conceivable facet of late nineteenth-century knowledge, this archive remains largely untapped by scholars, stakeholders and the general public. These fascinating and frequently beautiful objects are to be found in numerous local and national libraries, museums, and archives of all kinds, with some collections holding tens of thousands of lantern slides, but a lack of common standards for documentation and preservation has limited the impact of existing initiatives, and hindered the recognition of the significance of these objects. 'A Million Pictures' addresses the sustainable management of this invaluable, but overlooked, heritage resource and seeks to develop vital new tools for documentation, preservation, digitisation and re-use of lantern slides.
Across four case studies, taking place in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain, the project investigates the use of magic lantern slides within learned societies and educational institutions as well as in popular venues (theatres, opera houses, museums and observatories) and will also investigate methods for classifying the repertoire of these shows. It will explore the needs of contemporary museums, archives, libraries, and other collections for allowing access and re-use of slide images, and will provide examples of digital re-working of slide shows as well as other forms of re-enactment. It will examine ways for people to enhance their knowledge about lantern slides and so allow them to connect to their shared European history of learning.
The UK-based aspect of the project will explore three representative public collections: the Library of Birmingham, the Royal Geographic Society (RGS) in London, and the Exeter Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM), with a specific focus on slide sets and associated materials during the period 1880-1914.Indeed, one would be hard pushed to find a more neglected, yet substantial, national heritage resource than the magic lantern slide material dispersed across numerous British museums, libraries and archives. Individual collections each represent a remarkably rich visual archive concerning multiple aspects of national and regional public life. The Library of Birmingham possesses an estimated collection of over 100,000 slides, accumulated from the activities of numerous educational and civic organisations that were active within this large urban and industrial centre, whose scale and significance resembles that of only a few other British collections. The RAMM provides an excellent example of a smaller regional collection, of which there are many spread across the UK, with approximately 15,000 slides derived from the various organisations active during the period in question in this cathedral and market town. The RGS was, and remains, the hub of a national network, whose collection of approximately 20,000 slides was used both within the capital and in the numerous branches of the society active within cities and towns across Britain.
'A Million Pictures' will consider the different cataloguing practices as well as the different users of these three organisations. More broadly, it will publicise the scale and significance of these archives, and provide insights concerning an effective working model for their use, management, and promotion within the heritage sector more generally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will impact the following:

? Beneficiaries in the cultural heritage industry.
The project's approach to cultural heritage institutions is integral: rather than conducting academic research and subsequently seeing how heritage institutions can connect to the findings, the perspectives of stakeholders are considered in all stages of the research. This integral approach will maximise the relevance of the academic research projects, facilitate knowledge exchange and benefit institutions of cultural heritage. A Million Pictures proposes to deliver research-based knowledge and expertise directly to a selection of these heritage stakeholders, enabling them to better understand these resources and to make best use of them on behalf of their users. In the case of project APs, it will achieve this by intervening directly in their engagement with these materials, providing high quality digitised copies of samples of these slides alongside relevant metadata, and developing re-use projects intended to engage directly with their users. In relation to other heritage stakeholders not directly involved in the Project, these activities are designed to demonstrate the potential heritage value of all lantern slide collections which, we contend, have the potential to connect national and regional museums, libraries, and archives to new British and international audiences.

? Longer term heritage policy.
In contributing to the development of a European standard for description and cataloguing of lantern slide artefacts, the Project will develop a template for collection management that will be widely applicable to other collections and will serve as a foundation for future projects within them. The project will influence heritage policy by showcasing some of the strengths of these collections to archival, educational, and commercial stakeholders. To this effect, UK APs include public lantern slide collections of all kinds, in museums, libraries, and archives, whiche been subject to varied cataloguing practices, and whose exploitation is at different stages of development, allowing the project to provide case studies that are broadly applicable across the sector. Furthermore, through this project, the collaborating museums and archives will strengthen their international networks. This will allow future collaborations such as shared exhibitions, book publications and cultural events for devotees of old and new media.

? The public.
Working with APs in this way will permit a broad and long term engagement with the public, which will be able to gain access to lantern slide collections and knowledge concerning them for the first time. Forms of dissemination include:
- A virtual documentation centre for lantern slides and their contexts, based on the LUCERNA database, that is freely accessible to the general public, alongside provision of these materials through the APs' own digital fora. As an open access resource, with a proven track record in attracting not only academic researchers, but also professional and charitable organisations, as well as large numbers of amateur and family historians, LUCERNA will sustainably provide slide heritage to non-academic stakeholders of all kinds.
- Examples of public re-use of slide materials, including historical re-enacted slide shows, and research presentations.
- Peer-reviewed conference proceedings (Abstracts of papers will be translated into languages of participants and published on the project's website, based at the University of Utrecht).
- Regular Update on the project via website (based at the University of Utrecht), and social media (facebook, LinkedIn, twitter).
- All workshops have a slot reserved for a dissemination activity that will be open to the general public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>158287</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is the development of performer/artist Tony Lidington's original mobile peepshow device, a portable multi-media show which Tony provides to audiences in his role as a nineteenth-century showman - 'The Raree man'.

Research Team Utrecht: 'Learning About the European Neighbours'. This research project has begun to analyse lantern slide sets about European countries in the collection of EYE Film Institute Netherlands and University Museum Utrecht as well as in various private collections. These slide sets, produced in different countries, will provide the starting point to investigate visual knowledge that circulated across Europe about other countries and people, including the question of national stereotyping. Outputs thus far have included digitisation of approximately 2000 lantern slides; hosting the first research workshop in September 2015; presenting academic papers and public presentations.
? Research Team Antwerp: 'Popular Venues (Theatre, Opera Houses, Planetariums, Fairs).' The Antwerp research team has focused on the performative context of scientific and astronomical lantern shows in popular venues. The goal is to deepen the understanding of the cultural value of lantern shows in relation to changing ideas of theatricality, the adaptation of the lantern and its users to suit a certain venue, occasion and audience, and the complex struggle between didactic and aesthetic particularities. Outputs thus far have included presenting academic papers and public presentations.
? Research Team Girona and Salamanca: 'Taxonomic Organization of the Artefact and Examples of its Benefits for Creative Re-use of Lantern Slide Heritage'. Generating knowledge about lantern slides as elements of cultural heritage has been problematic because slides have been classified in a dispersed manner across multiple host institutions, hindering comparative studies across institutions and disciplines. The Spanish team has begun to address these issues.

Chetham's Library, Manchester and Ilfracombe Museum are partners that we have begun working with in the course of the project, with substantial programmes of lantern slide digitisation in operation. In the Edinburgh Museum of Childhood and the Devon and Exeter Institution, project members have worked in an informal consultancy role advising these institutions on preservation and best practices in relation to their lantern slide collections. At the Royal Institution, we have agreed to co-host a workshop open to the general public, highlighting the connections between the magic lantern and popular science, and especially highlighting the collections at the RI itself. In each of these individual collaborations, the UK-based team has been directly responsible for working with each of these owners of magic lantern slide collections, within the broad parameters of the pan-European project.

In most of these collections, the project is digitising large numbers of slides to be made accessible to the public via an Open Access digital database called 'Lucerna.' This is vital in the UK, where hundreds of local collections exist in Museums and Libraries, ranging from a few hundred slides to over a hundred thousand in each, almost all uncatalogued, inaccessible, and misunderstood. The UK project is working in a representative sample of these institutions in order to (1) allow these local collections to access their slides and exhibit them to the public, both during and after the project, and (2) provide a case study which can be applied across the UK (and internationally), demonstrating to a full range of collections the immense, unexploited value of the pictorial resources locked up in unseen lantern slide collections. Contributions related to digitisation of slides thus far as as follows:
- RAMM: Image capture and data entry for approximately 4,500 slides; provision of high quality images and metadata directly to the RAMM. As a consequence of this, there is now a track record of amateur and professional scholars accessing images through lucerna, then requesting higher quality images from the RAMM itself for use in publications and presentations.
- Manchester Museum: Image capture of approximately 10,000 slides; input to Lucerna and full data entry of 3500 of these.
- Royal Geographical Society: Image capture of 1,000 slides as permitted contractually in collaboration with the RGS; provision of high quality images and metadata directly to the RGS; input to Lucerna and full data entry remaining to complete.
- Chetham's Library: Image capture of approximately 2000 slides; input to Lucerna and full data entry for approximately 1,200 of these.
- Ilfracombe Museum: Image capture of approximately 2000 slides; input to Lucerna and full data entry for approximately 700 of these.

In addition, the project has almost completed the process of defining standardized vocabulary and working procedures for lantern slides, intended to create world-wide standards according to which any collection might begin to assess and catalogue its own materials effectively. All partners listed above have benefited from the knowledge and skills generated by the project. UK-based project team members have been at the centre of this process, partly in relation to the development of new routines and taxonomic practices on the Lucerna database, and partly by attendance at international workshops including the 'Lucerna Hackathon' hosted at the University of Brighton in October 2016, in which crucial decisions were made about the standards for digitisation and cataloguing to be made by the project as whole.

Equally crucial to the UK team collaboration with Museums and other collections has been the provision of public engagement events making use of magic lantern slides. These have been most extensive at the RAMM, where the project began its digitisation work, and where four project talks and entertainments have now been given by the UK team. In addition a series of other events have now taken place within the RAMM independently of the project that have included the lantern slide images created by the project. By way of illustration of the diversity of these uses, these have included: a Halloween show intended for children; a musical event featuring slide projections; a new exhibition on landscape imagery, including the projection of relevant slides digitised by the project. In short, the RAMM is an excellent case study of the diversity of uses to which this resource can be put. In addition to these public engagement events, others have been staged at the Royal Geographical Society (an illustrated talk and workshop for members and the public) and the Royal Institution in London (a general public all day workshop and an evening lantern show on 17th March 2017), each featuring UK project members and collaborators.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Geographical Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Associated Partnerships with British museums and archives</gtr:description><gtr:id>A9DA0A9C-B5BE-4406-8801-3773AA9DAB94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Uploading of details of approximately 11,000 slides from the RAMM to open access Lucerna database.

Research Team Utrecht: 'Learning About the European Neighbours'. This research project has begun to analyse lantern slide sets about European countries in the collection of EYE Film Institute Netherlands and University Museum Utrecht as well as in various private collections. These slide sets, produced in different countries, will provide the starting point to investigate visual knowledge that circulated across Europe about other countries and people, including the question of national stereotyping. Outputs thus far have included digitisation of approximately 2000 lantern slides; hosting the first research workshop in September 2015; presenting academic papers and public presentations.
? Research Team Antwerp: 'Popular Venues (Theatre, Opera Houses, Planetariums, Fairs).' The Antwerp research team has focused on the performative context of scientific and astronomical lantern shows in popular venues. The goal is to deepen the understanding of the cultural value of lantern shows in relation to changing ideas of theatricality, the adaptation of the lantern and its users to suit a certain venue, occasion and audience, and the complex struggle between didactic and aesthetic particularities. Outputs thus far have included presenting academic papers and public presentations.
? Research Team Girona and Salamanca: 'Taxonomic Organization of the Artefact and Examples of its Benefits for Creative Re-use of Lantern Slide Heritage'. Generating knowledge about lantern slides as elements of cultural heritage has been problematic because slides have been classified in a dispersed manner across multiple host institutions, hindering comparative studies across institutions and disciplines. The Spanish team has begun to address these issues.

It has also benefited by drawing on the performance skills of individuals such as Jeremy Brooker, the current Chair of the Society. The other subject associations have contributed space in local venues, and the time of their staff and members.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The chief collaboration between Million Pictures and a subject association has been with the Magic Lantern Society, the leading subject association on all matters related to the history and practice of optical projection. The Society has over 330 members worldwide (collectors, historians, and enthusiasts from all walks of life), most of whom are not university-affiliated scholars. The MLS runs a vibrant programme of discussion and performance and has a long association with the Lucerna Magic Lantern Web Resource, to which the Million Pictures project has already made an impressive contribution. The great expansion of Lucerna's online image bank enabled by the project has already transformed the MLS's understanding of the remarkable wealth of lantern slides held in public collections.
The Million Pictures project is also assisting the Society with two more direct collaborations. The first of these will take place on 17 March 2017 at the Royal Institution, London, where the Chair of the MLS will be giving an evening lantern performance based on the work of John Tyndall, open to the public and supported by the project as part of a workshop. The second is during the Society's International Convention, taking place on 28-30 April 2017 in Birmingham, where the project has co-sponsored and co-organised a programme of entertainment and exhibition events for its members and for the general public.
In addition, the other local societies and subject associations listed above have all received public talks given by members of the UK project team based upon their knowledge of lantern slides, and digitisation of collections relevant in each case.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ilfracombe Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Associated Partnerships with British museums and archives</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B4B2174-F106-4A58-85F3-F36CFA7879B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Uploading of details of approximately 11,000 slides from the RAMM to open access Lucerna database.

Chetham's Library, Manchester and Ilfracombe Museum are partners that we have begun working with in the course of the project, with substantial programmes of lantern slide digitisation in operation. In the Edinburgh Museum of Childhood and the Devon and Exeter Institution, project members have worked in an informal consultancy role advising these institutions on preservation and best practices in relation to their lantern slide collections. At the Royal Institution, we have agreed to co-host a workshop open to the general public, highlighting the connections between the magic lantern and popular science, and especially highlighting the collections at the RI itself. In each of these individual collaborations, the UK-based team has been directly responsible for working with each of these owners of magic lantern slide collections, within the broad parameters of the pan-European project.

In most of these collections, the project is digitising large numbers of slides to be made accessible to the public via an Open Access digital database called 'Lucerna.' This is vital in the UK, where hundreds of local collections exist in Museums and Libraries, ranging from a few hundred slides to over a hundred thousand in each, almost all uncatalogued, inaccessible, and misunderstood. The UK project is working in a representative sample of these institutions in order to (1) allow these local collections to access their slides and exhibit them to the public, both during and after the project, and (2) provide a case study which can be applied across the UK (and internationally), demonstrating to a full range of collections the immense, unexploited value of the pictorial resources locked up in unseen lantern slide collections. Contributions related to digitisation of slides thus far as as follows:
- RAMM: Image capture and data entry for approximately 4,500 slides; provision of high quality images and metadata directly to the RAMM. As a consequence of this, there is now a track record of amateur and professional scholars accessing images through lucerna, then requesting higher quality images from the RAMM itself for use in publications and presentations.
- Manchester Museum: Image capture of approximately 10,000 slides; input to Lucerna and full data entry of 3500 of these.
- Royal Geographical Society: Image capture of 1,000 slides as permitted contractually in collaboration with the RGS; provision of high quality images and metadata directly to the RGS; input to Lucerna and full data entry remaining to complete.
- Chetham's Library: Image capture of approximately 2000 slides; input to Lucerna and full data entry for approximately 1,200 of these.
- Ilfracombe Museum: Image capture of approximately 2000 slides; input to Lucerna and full data entry for approximately 700 of these.

In addition, the project has almost completed the process of defining standardized vocabulary and working procedures for lantern slides, intended to create world-wide standards according to which any collection might begin to assess and catalogue its own materials effectively. All partners listed above have benefited from the knowledge and skills generated by the project. UK-based project team members have been at the centre of this process, partly in relation to the development of new routines and taxonomic practices on the Lucerna database, and partly by attendance at international workshops including the 'Lucerna Hackathon' hosted at the University of Brighton in October 2016, in which crucial decisions were made about the standards for digitisation and cataloguing to be made by the project as whole.

Equally crucial to the UK team collaboration with Museums and other collections has been the provision of public engagement events making use of magic lantern slides. These have been most extensive at the RAMM, where the project began its digitisation work, and where four project talks and entertainments have now been given by the UK team. In addition a series of other events have now taken place within the RAMM independently of the project that have included the lantern slide images created by the project. By way of illustration of the diversity of these uses, these have included: a Halloween show intended for children; a musical event featuring slide projections; a new exhibition on landscape imagery, including the projection of relevant slides digitised by the project. In short, the RAMM is an excellent case study of the diversity of uses to which this resource can be put. In addition to these public engagement events, others have been staged at the Royal Geographical Society (an illustrated talk and workshop for members and the public) and the Royal Institution in London (a general public all day workshop and an evening lantern show on 17th March 2017), each featuring UK project members and collaborators.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Manchester Museum</gtr:department><gtr:description>Associated Partnerships with British museums and archives</gtr:description><gtr:id>DC9EB62E-4B79-40DF-9552-487849B6FA31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Uploading of details of approximately 11,000 slides from the RAMM to open access Lucerna database.

? Enhancing the research capacity, knowledge and skills of public organisations: A key impact of 'A Million Pictures'. Alongside European partners, the UK project has contributed to formation of new standards for pan-European digitisation and cataloging of lantern slides. Working within museums and other public collections, we have also provided high quality images and metadata, alongside broader knowledge concerning the use and value of magic lantern slides. Lantern slides are most often uncatalogued, poorly understood, and frequently hidden aspects of many public collections: digitisation massively enhances research capacity, and our work within collections and with staff increases their knowledge and skills in relation to cataloguing, processing and re-using these invaluable repositories.
? Changing organisational culture and practices: At the RAM Museum, the first collection to be completed, this has become most evident in the re-use of lantern resources in digital format. In addition to project-sponsored engagement, several components of the lantern slide collections have now been re-used by the Museum itself in the course of its own exhibitions and events. In short, the project has allowed them to access and re-use their own collections across a broad spectrum of activities, from a landscape exhibition to a children's Halloween show. We have shaped museological practice by helping organisations to share their collections.
? Enhancing cultural enrichment: creating access to unknown pictorial resources, and sponsoring digital and 'live' creative re-use of these, the project makes a massive library of images available to a broad public via Lucerna, and has stimulated cultural enrichment events within regional collections.
? Increasing public engagement with research and related societal issues: through assorted media, including the project's own website and newsletters, and through project sponsored public events in several countries, we have increased public awareness and understanding of both the magic lantern as a medium, and of the range of subjects it is capable of presenting. In addition, the Lucerna Magic Lantern Web Resource has enabled an international general public to access information and images relevant for those interested in aspects of media history, popular science, art history, local history, and family history.
? Creation of a Community Interest Company, with a chair and board dedicated to the sustainability of the Lucerna Magic Lantern web resource.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A4E9D581-3833-44E9-9831-C741BBBFAD02</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>The creation of large numbers of images derived from collections in public hands, licensed for distribution on an open access database, has required the generation of contracts between the university and each collection reflecting fair use.

However, despite its pervasiveness across multiple scientific, educational and popular contexts, magic lantern slides remain under-researched. Although many libraries and museums across Europe hold tens of thousands of lantern slides in their collections, a lack of standards for documentation and preservation limits the impact of existing initiatives, hinders the recognition of the object's heritage value and potential exploitation. Put simply, the project has begun the process of explaining the significance of untapped lantern slide collections - a massive visual resource at the heart of European culture 1850-1950 - to public collections, and of enabling them to access and use these resources in their own exhibitions. This project has also begun to address the sustainable preservation of this massive, untapped heritage resource and to provide guidelines for the (digital) documentation of lantern slides.
The slides collections from various Museums and archives have now been reused extensively in events that have included public talks, a Halloween show, and an Alice in Wonderland-styled musical performance, as well as in public events at national institutions such as the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Institution. In short, the project's discoveries of materials within the archive, and its development of a digital resource available to all has already borne fruit: several collections are now bringing their hidden collections to the public both within and outside the original confines of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are already being used by numerous academics and private researchers who are able to access the Lucerna Magic Lantern Web Resource database and the contents that have been uploaded thus far during the project. 
 In addition, the Museums and other collections we are working with have changed their own practices as a result of our work with them. The RAM Museum, initially, has taken advantage of our digitisation of large numbers of slides in order to improve access to and knowledge concerning its hidden archives of slides; to improve, rethink or develop cataloguing practices; and to find innovative ways to bring lantern slides before the general public.
Finally, artists and performers have already made use of our discoveries by developing creative re-use projects based on our digitised slides. These have included the redevelopment of a modern peepshow and a multi-media evening celebrating the 150th anniversary of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>72FA7D9A-C2AB-4537-8BFD-1DE64645D02C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://a-million-pictures.wp.hum.uu.nl/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence on museological policies concerning magic lantern resources</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>908C59C0-5466-45AE-9BE8-C70DADDB5EFE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As members of the project's committees on digitisation, cataloguing and standardisation, the project team has had an impact on the accessability, cataloguing, and re-use of magic lantern slide materials within publicly held collections.

It includes details of slide sets, slide images, readings and other texts related to slide sets, lantern hardware, people and organisations involved in lantern history, and any other related detail associated with magic lantern production and use. Currently hosted by the University of Trier, the database is a product of several Universities, including the University of Exeter and other project partners. Though the database first appeared in 2008, it is only with the advent of 'A Million Pictures', that it has been possible to consult stakeholders, adapt the database, and expand dramatically.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A4EE2EA0-A825-4386-8B50-4C2330B48733</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Increasing public engagement with research: A Million Pictures has consulted with academic, museum professional, and general public stakeholders with a view to refining both the data entry methods and the standardisation of slide reproduction and metadata categories on Lucerna. This has resulted in the adaptation of Lucerna into a more usable format, both for scholars wishing to upload information internationally, and for researchers of all kinds wishing to learn more information concerning the lantern and related historical issues. For example, we have experimented with provision of multi-language data-entry, with a view to securing funding for a large-scale translation project utilising the existing dataset.
- Cultural enrichment: thus far, project partners have uploaded approximately 11,000 slide images and associated metadata to the project database, with 10,000 more images captured and awaiting processing. The bulk of these (95%) have been processed by the UK team. This represents a substantial increase in the database's coverage, especially with regard to educational and geographical material related to British museums and other collections. As a consequence, Lucerna is seeing increased traffic from researchers of all kinds, assisting in numerous independent projects and raising public awareness of the magic lantern.
- Enhancing the research capacity, knowledge and skills of public organisations: Lucerna has provided a template for museums and other collections seeking to digitise slide materials and provide contextual metadata for cataloguing and exhibition purposes. The images and data held on Lucerna are searchable by collection, meaning that the RAM Museum, for example, now has access to its own digital archive online, along with existing metadata. In addition, they have been provided with their own higher quality images and their own copy of the metadata generated. This has significantly raised the profile of the Museum's own collections: these images were previously buried in the archive; now they are fully accessible and have been used for presentations, exhibitions (forthcoming) and events, as well as by scholars seeking to include illustrations within their publications.
- The Million Pictures project has enabled the consolidation and increased sustainability of Lucerna by developing its own management Board as part of a new Community Interest Company, established in January 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>LUCERNA - The Magic Lantern Web Resource</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.slides.uni-trier.de/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Lantern slide collections have been subject to very diverse practices of cataloguing and digitisation in different collections across Europe.

These have been developed during the first three workshops, refined within the collections in the months since, and will be revisited in the fourth workshop in january 2017. These decisions have been reflected in the development of Lucerna, an online open access database, which is now the most important tool for anyone wishing to research magic lantern materials, worldwide.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A24E93A4-9D62-4870-BE54-FF4EBB93C7AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The provision of digitised slides in conjunction with metadata provided by researchers has enabled Museums to access and re-use these materials for the first time.
