&lt;p>The work will analyse how far the quality of legal and other formal institutions has affected financial development and economic growth in these countries, and whether reliance on informal institutions poses an obstacle to their future growth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will adopt an inter-disciplinary, multi-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of the extent and nature of correlations between legal and financial development, with qualitative, fieldwork-based research aimed at building up a detailed, micro-institutional account of the perceptions and strategies of actors involved in legal and financial reforms. It will make use of legal and financial datasets to carry out time-series and panel data analysis capable of specifying causal links between legal institutions and economic development.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The fieldwork will focus on the role played in each country by the banking sector and capital markets as sources of finance for firms, and on how government reconciles or combines its continuing role as owner of financial and industrial enterprise with its emerging role as a regulator of banks and securities markets.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential beneficiaries of the research are users in international financial institutions including the World Bank, IMF, EBRD, Asian Development Bank and Inter-American Development Bank; officials of national governments including civil servants and regulators; commercial parties and business users in the countries that are the focus of the case studies; users in financial and legal service firms and exporting companies and other industrial enterprises in the UK and other trading partners of the rising powers; and NGOs, policy advisers, and journalists and commentators interested in issues of legal and economic development. Each of these groups is in a position to benefit from the findings of the research which will throw light on the relationship between legal and financial reform and economic development in the rising powers. 

The international financial institutions have been major sponsors of research on the issue of law and development since the early 1990s and have helped to stimulate debate on it. They organize extensive programmes of technical advice on legal and financial matters to national governments. For example, the World Bank has been prominent in ranking the business environments of countries though its 'Doing Business' Reports, and the EBRD has helped to initiate law reform programmes in the area of insolvency law in a number of countries. Our research has the potential to inform these activities by throwing new light on the preconditions for the successful implementation of law reform initiatives in emerging markets.

National governments will also be in a position to benefit from the research. The governments of the case study countries and those of their trading partners including the UK will benefit from the analysis of the prospects for development in the rising powers.

A wide range of commercial organizations will be interested in the research. Legal service firms, financial service firms and investment companies with a base in London as well as those based outside the UK will be in a position to use insights from the research into the current state of legal and financial development in the countries concerned and the sustainability of their current growth paths.

NGOs, policy-makers, commentators, journalists and others with an interest in development issues will also be able to make use of the research findings. The prospects for future growth in the case study countries, the likely course of their integration into the global economy, and possible barriers to sustainable development in these countries, will be of interest to each of these groups.

In terms of timescale, the immediate benefits, realisable within the course of the project, will take the form of up-to-date information on the current state of legal and financial development in the case study countries. Our findings will directly inform analysis of the legal and financial risks and opportunities faced by UK and other overseas firms doing business in developing countries. 

In the medium term, results will be available from a more in-depth analysis of the fieldwork data, and from their integration with the macro-level data on legal and financial variables that we will also be collating and analyzing. Within 1-2 years of the project's completion, results with the potential to make a significant contribution to research in this area will be ready for publication in academic journals and for dissemination to a wider audience of business, commercial and governmental users. 

In the longer-term, the research has the potential to make a fundamental theoretical contribution to the understanding of the relationship between law, finance and development, of the kind that can guide the design of institutions and policies at international and national level.

The potential relevance of the project to non-academic users is indicated by the willingness of a global law firm and an NGO to co-fund it.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>520526</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Law, trust, and institutional variation in China: evidence from qualitative fieldwork</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E18DFBF8-13E8-4E8E-AEBE-3CCEFC05D27F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Evidence on contractual practice and legal and financial development in China was presented to an audience of senior judges, officials and academics at a forum on the rule of law and judicial reform convened at the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, 11-12 December 2015.

In April 2015 the findings on the Russian and Chinese fieldwork were reported to an audience of over 100 practitioners in the areas of law and financial services, convened by the City law firm Clifford Chance at its London offices, as part of the firm's Thought Leadership programme. In February 2016 the findings on Brazil were reported to a similarly sized group, again under the auspices of Clifford Chance's Thought Leadership programme, at a seminar in London.

In December 2015 the findings on the Chinese fieldwork were reported to a forum on the rule of law, attended by senior judges, policy makers and lawyers, held at the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. 

Also in December 2015, feedback sessions were organised with legal practitioners in Beijing, Guangzhou and Foshan; with the Foshan Lawyers' Association; and with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

There was consultation at various points during 2015 with officials of the World Bank on the construction of indices of shareholder protection. During 2016 there was discussion on potential use of shareholder protection data with officials of the OECD Trade Union Advisory Council.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A9D1AC19-4FBD-43BA-B928-793530734380</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We explored the role of law in promoting financial development with the focus on emerging markets. We constructed new indices of shareholder rights and creditor rights in 30 countries over the period 1990-2013. These new datasets enabled us to measure the global diffusion of laws for the protection of investors and creditors, and to estimate their effects on stock market and credit market development. While the impact of legal convergence was mediated by country-specific effects including local laws and institutions, we did observe some common trends. A key finding is that the strengthening of shareholder rights is associated with a rise in equity values although not, consistently, with increases in stock trading or in the number of listed companies. Thus a provisional conclusion is that enacting shareholder rights may not be enough on its own to create deeper and more liquid capital markets in developing economies.

We supplemented our econometric work with fieldwork in the four BRIC countries. Each country has a distinct experience but again there are some common trends. 

In China our fieldwork led us to be sceptical of the claim that China's recent economic growth is mainly the result of guanxi or interpersonal trust coupled with strong direction from central government. Instead we find increasingly sophisticated use of contracts and growing demand for the rule of law. There is less reliance on guanxi in product markets, in particular in the more economically advanced regions and in developing sectors such as IT. 

However, the move towards market-based transacting and transparent pricing is less evident in the case of Chinese financial markets. Chinese stock markets are not regarded as transparent and are dominated by state-owned enterprises. They do not yet provide a reliable source of equity finance for private-sector firms. Start-ups in sectors such as IT tend to rely on family members and angel investors for funding, rather than venture capital or IPOs. However, some of our interviewees expected Chinese stock markets to become more transparent over time.

In Russia we observed a somewhat different picture: there is pent-up demand for the rule of law but less confidence in the legal system, a stronger perception of judicial corruption, and more concern over a 'predatory' state, than in China. At the same time there has been a discernible change in the business environment in Russia since the turbulence of the 1990s. Medium-sized businesses can generally operate successfully as long as they stay 'below the radar' of state officials. 

A theme emerging from the Russian research is that western laws and practices cannot be simply imposed in the transition to a market economy. Entrepreneurial freedom and a reduced role for the state do not automatically translate into economic development, but may create the conditions for opportunism and abuse of power. The absence of democratic institutions may undermine otherwise sophisticated market-orientated laws.

The experiences of Brazil and India, both democracies, make for a relevant contrast. In both cases we observe positive effects of legal and corporate governance reforms aimed at promoting transparency in stock markets and encouraging bank-based lending to private sector firms. At the same time, larger enterprises play an important role in the stock market and in the economy as a whole, and convergence on a western model of deep and liquid capital markets is a gradual process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They will be of interest to governments, international organisations, law firms, companies, and trade associations in finance.

As part of a subsequent project on 'Rising Powers', we have extended the number of countries and time period for which this coding has been done. The extended index now covers 1990-2013 (24 years) for 31 countries, a total of 7,440 observations. In addition to coding the extra years, this exercise also involved a review of the coding for the years coded in the earlier index, and in some cases this has been revised in light of new information.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AF89DD31-E54E-4D64-BF13-E3843EA1F491</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The dataset will shortly be online, having been archived via the UK Data Service.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Extended Creditor Protection Index</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset has been developed as part of the 'Law, Finance and Development' project at the Centre for Business Research, University of Cambridge, UK.
