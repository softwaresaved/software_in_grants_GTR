Transport is essential to survival, as evidenced by genetic diseases caused by defective transport genes; cystic fibrosis is a particularly prominent example in Celtic countries. Given the importance of transport, it is surprising how many genes still need function ascribed to them experimentally. Recently, a new class of exchanger gene called CPA2 has been identified. It can be found from bacteria to humans, and exchanges sodium ions for hydrogen ions. One of the two human genes has already been identified as a candidate in essential hypertension, and in bone resorption - two processes central to human ageing. It is thus important to find out what the CPA2 gene family does in higher organisms. We plan to study the CPA2 genes in an established genetic model, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster where (as in humans) there are two CPA2 family members. Using Drosophila confers several advantages: the work is quicker (it takes only three months to generate a transgenic fly), cheaper ( it takes only tens of pounds to keep a line of flies alive for a year), and ethical (no experiments on mammals are required). We thus see work in Drosophila as an exciting adjunct to continuing medical study of humans, and the likely generation of mouse models in other labs. Our work will focus on identifying what the genes do, particularly in the fly 'kidney' where we have recently shown that the genes are strongly expressed. We will study the transport properties of the protein in the test tube, and use the information to explain what they may contribute to the functioning of the whole organism. Insects are important in their own right, as over a million lives are lost to malaria alone each year; and the WHO claim that a third of world crops are lost to insect attack in the field or in storage. We plan to extend our results to close relatives of Drosophila, the mosquitoes, in order to see whether the results we have generated are applicable across the insects. If so, the CPA2 family may be targets for novel insecticides.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Recently, a new class of exchanger gene, called CPA2, has been identified. It can be found from bacteria to humans, and exchanges sodium ions for hydrogen ions. By contrast with the traditional NHE (CPA1) family of electroneutral exchangers, the CPA2 exchangers are electrogenic. One of the two human genes has already been identified as a candidate in essential hypertension, and in bone resorption - two processes central to human ageing. It is thus important to find out what the CPA2 gene family does in higher organisms. We plan to study the CPA2s both in vitro and in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster where (as in humans) there are two CPA2 family members. Using Drosophila confers several advantages: the work is quicker (it takes only three months to generate a transgenic fly), cheaper (it takes only tens of pounds to keep a line of flies alive for a year), and ethical (no experiments on mammals are required). We already have data to suggest that both fly CPA2s co localize with a plasma membrane V-ATPase in the fly renal (Malpighian) tubule, and that the two exchangers may have differing preferences for sodium and potassium. The major objectives of the work-plan are to: - measure each CPA2 member across the major tissues, to test the model that they are partners for the plasma-membrane V-ATPase - reconstitute each CPA2 member in purified proteoliposomes, in order to determine their preference for Na/H, K/H, or Na/Li exchange - identify inhibitors for the CPA2 family in animals - test the role of the exchangers by generating single and double RNAi knockdown flies. - extend the work to the closely related Diptera, the malarial and yellow fever mosquitoes. Together, the work-plan should provide a rapid, clear and multifaceted understanding of the roles of this new gene family in a metazoan.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>423862</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mayo Clinic</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the Mayo Institute for Urology, Rochester, MINN</gtr:description><gtr:id>8644B987-3914-42A6-8922-DAD1BFC514BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have published several papers from the collaboration:

Like us, insects regulate their internal environment by pumping in desirable compounds, and excreting waste products, across the sheets of cells, or epithelia (like gut, lung, kidney in us) that separate their different body compartments.
Our lab has a long published history in trying to establish how insects accomplish this job. This is because some of the remarkable success of this Class of life - there are more species of insects than all other living things combined - can be ascribed to their ability to regulate their internal environments in a range of harsh conditions.
In this award, we studied the two new Na+/H+ exchangers, Nha1 and Nha2, that we had discovered in a recent paper.
We developed a collaboration with Michael Romero in the Mayo institute, and published a seminal paper in PNAS, together with several ancillary publications. Critically, one of the exchangers simply does not function as had been expected, so emphasising the danger of trying to infer the functions of new proteins from structural similarity with others of known function.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The new understanding of Nha function will be of broad interest , from biomedicine (there are two similar genes, also under-researched, in humans), to insect control. For example, we have developed and implemented a yeast-based screen for natural compounds that inhibit these exchangers. Our of 6500 plant extracts, we had 20 hot hits, and are in discussion with Zoetis on possible commercial exploitation as novel insecticides.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E5B171F6-E87D-42B8-9FFE-B5EC35816A45</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0BE8F36D-FA31-4043-92E5-3F295328F0D8"><gtr:id>0BE8F36D-FA31-4043-92E5-3F295328F0D8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Separate roles of PKA and EPAC in renal function unraveled by the optogenetic control of cAMP levels in vivo.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of cell science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/76b99993a6cd50890ef0a2a058ed653d"><gtr:id>76b99993a6cd50890ef0a2a058ed653d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Efetova M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9533</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F4B34AE0-85A1-4259-B374-40CEF497A486"><gtr:id>F4B34AE0-85A1-4259-B374-40CEF497A486</gtr:id><gtr:title>Chloride channels in stellate cells are essential for uniquely high secretion rates in neuropeptide-stimulated Drosophila diuresis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ceed339d5128d5cb93e7b58326d54bb6"><gtr:id>ceed339d5128d5cb93e7b58326d54bb6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cabrero P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1C8CFF30-2E89-40E5-AFC1-35C32207B629"><gtr:id>1C8CFF30-2E89-40E5-AFC1-35C32207B629</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transport proteins NHA1 and NHA2 are essential for survival, but have distinct transport modalities.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5a502a9cf9ad36a1b8f3983f5f569723"><gtr:id>5a502a9cf9ad36a1b8f3983f5f569723</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chintapalli VR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BDBBFFDD-6A17-4494-8CDB-21C2702E3EED"><gtr:id>BDBBFFDD-6A17-4494-8CDB-21C2702E3EED</gtr:id><gtr:title>A comprehensive transcriptomic view of renal function in the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Insect biochemistry and molecular biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cf8ca1c36409bda27797c29bee4dcd05"><gtr:id>cf8ca1c36409bda27797c29bee4dcd05</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Overend G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0965-1748</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0187E7E2-D22E-44BF-B9B3-27E26AB7D960"><gtr:id>0187E7E2-D22E-44BF-B9B3-27E26AB7D960</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sulfate and thiosulfate inhibit oxalate transport via a dPrestin (Slc26a6)-dependent mechanism in an insect model of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of physiology.
