(Christianity became the official religion of the Empire in AD312). In particular the focus will be on North Africa between the 3rd/4th century (the final centuries of the Roman empire) and the early 6th century (the creation of the new Christian Byzantine Empire). In the past, approaches to these themes have considered such a transformation a revolutionary change, that brought about the destruction of temples and statues and the rise of a strong Christian community. In North Africa in particular this phenomenon has been emphasised because of important Christian figures, such as Saint Cyprian and Saint Augustine. However, archaeological evidence seems to suggest a completely different panorama, where the pagan community survived for a long period and the Christian community maintained some pagan traditions; they both lived together and shared common places and cities. Temple were not destroyed, but sometimes restored and were in use during at least the 4th century. Statues were often removed, but preserved intact, and hidden in cisterns to protect their sacred value. In other cases they were moved, grouped together and displayed as if in a museum. The meaning of these actions needs to be investigated. Also early Byzantine churches, decorated with a variety of marbles, columns and capitals, were seen as highly original and beautiful. Again archaeology seems to suggest that there was an organised and planned dismantling of the decoration of former public buildings and probably there was an organised commerce in these decorative elements. All of these aspects therefore demand reconsideration. The proposed research finds a specific comparison in modern societies where the issue of different religious traditions co-existing in the same contexts remains problematic. Also issues of the transformation, reuse and reconceptualisation of existing derelict buildings apply to many modern cities. The project aims at the completion of a book that will collect together the data and will reanalyse the archaeological evidence in conjunction with historical sources, in order to shed new light on the events and re-direct future research, in other geographical areas, on this difficult moment of transition from one Empire to another and from one religious tradition to another.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-07-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16161</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G002983/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>59A2A0A2-345A-4E14-85F6-936CA1B268C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science-Based Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
