Through this system, participating power and industrial firms are given or sold a certain number of emissions allowances which they can then trade amongst each other.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will provide the first assessment of the effects of the EUETS on the energy efficiency and performance of individual businesses. Using firm-level data on energy use, output and employment in a large sample of business establishments in the United Kingdom and France, it will study how the introduction of the EUETS in January 2005 has affected business energy use, in particular whether it has resulted in additional energy savings. It will also estimate the impact that the policy has had on participating firms' performance and their competitiveness.&lt;br />&lt;br />With its focus on the short-run effects of the trading scheme and on two countries, this project is the first of a larger research agenda that will lead to the study other European countries as well as the longer-term implications of a carbon market on firms' behaviour and performance.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research output will not only be relevant to other academics. It will also be relevant to the following non-academic bodies: 1) Government agencies in the UK and France involved in the negotiation of the EUETS future phases design and in its implementation (in the UK: Department for Energy and Climate Change, Department for Business Innovation and Skills, DEFRA, Treasury) as it will provide them with new evidence on the effectiveness of the EUETS and its impact on competitiveness and performance, thus improving decision-making .2) For similar reasons, the European Commission's DG for Climate Action in charge of the design and administration of the EUETS, the DG Enterprise and Industry as well as members of the European Parliament. Given that climate policies are going to be needed in the future, the timescale of the project will allow its results to impact policy-making. 3) Firms taking part in the EUETS and their trade associations.4) Consulting firms involved in helping firms on the market as well as financial institutions taking part in the EUETS5) Policymakers outside the EU planning to implement carbon markets. Various countries, including Australia and the US, are currently in the process of designing climate change policy with emissions trading as a key feature. By assessing the impact of the European carbon market on energy efficiency and competitiveness, this research may have a strong influence on the political acceptability of future carbon markets.6) The public at large as it is the beneficiary of emissions reductions, of the revenue of potential EUETS permits auctioning but also bears part of the carbon price burden in the form of higher commodity prices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79761</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Louvain 2015- Atelier de l'Environmment</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7FA68C5B-F0D9-437A-BA60-E69A165E21B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Debate between private sector - public sector and academics

This implies action in the coming decades by many actors around the world. In particular policy makers are having to design and implement climate policies that will incentivise individuals and companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. One of their options is to put in place carbon markets, such as the system that has been in place in the EU since 2005, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the subject of our research project and findings.
In the run-up to the Paris conference, our research was presented to policy makers and used to change the perception that the EU ETS had had no significant impact on emissions. Our results indicate that the EU ETS was not a failure. Despite the low price that prevailed, it managed to meet some of the objectives it was set up for. Our review of the literature also shows that this conclusion is that of other research projects, and by publishing it in the Review for Environmental Economics and Policy, we have ensured that it is being widely read by policy makers: it is one of the most read articles at the moment, as reported on their website. Whilst it would be unrealistic to claim that our findings influenced the outcome of Paris, we have probably contributed in a small part to the shifting vision of policy makers and businesses on carbon markets and their effectiveness, and their rolling out in many countries globally.
 Our findings are also being used by policy makers in countries where the choice for a carbon market has already been made. Our presentation to ICAP allowed us to transfer the knowledge about our findings to the very people that are working within their national administrations to put in place the carbon trading systems. This is certainly useful information for them as they can gather an increased momentum and support for these policies.
Indirectly, an improved and increased implementation of carbon markets will allow for reduced emissions, hence benefiting the entirety of society and future generations though a decreased risk of dangerous climate change.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C321079E-8173-45F7-AEC2-146C54238D10</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>? The EU Emissions Trading System was established as the world's first carbon market in 2005 as one of the EU's main climate change policies. It has often been considered as a failure, with low prices on the market that have followed from excessive permit allocations and the economic crisis. Our research finds a statistically significant reduction in CO2 emissions by close to 16% during Phase II in French manufacturing firms. This highlights how the use of firm-level data can bring more precision than sector-level data: we compare plants that were included by the policy vs those that were from the same sector and similar energy intensity but not part of the ETS. 

? Our research result on emissions and employment has also opened up a new research question on how firms adjust and reallocate their production following the set up of emissions trading systems. Whilst we find that they have reduced their emissions and reduced slightly employment in participating plants, their energy intensity has also decreased. How were these energy efficiencies brought in given their was no impact on firm-level turnover? We are also now investigating whether the composition of employment at the firm level was affected.

? Our efforts have also shown that it is possible to use French data on firms for academic research whilst being based in the UK, through a remote secure server access and by following a time-consuming but well established administrative procedure.
? Our research has also highlighted the difficulties of working on firm-level data across several countries. It requires patience, as each country has different time lags in data access. It is more efficient to seek data access for a wide range of datasets that could potentially needed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results can be taken forward by businesses having to design their response to climate change's opportunities and risks. Knowing that carbon markets have not led to decreases in turnover, whilst bringing in emission reductions could lead them to further investigate the potential to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions at low cost. This is true for manufacturing firms but also the consultancies that provide services to them.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>09D0A63A-FB6D-4BAB-AD77-1D830E67B00A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/965F8E6F-FF71-417D-B23E-4A8C7AD7B712"><gtr:id>965F8E6F-FF71-417D-B23E-4A8C7AD7B712</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Impact of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme on Regulated Firms: What Is the Evidence after Ten Years?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Review of Environmental Economics and Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c1a514435b34eb9e88d597d93df12788"><gtr:id>c1a514435b34eb9e88d597d93df12788</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9DA473AF-33B6-4674-BCFB-7127A80793BE"><gtr:id>9DA473AF-33B6-4674-BCFB-7127A80793BE</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Causal Effects of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme: Evidence from French Manufacturing Plants</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fba5d3596e35ca0b9513dded4b6383c0"><gtr:id>fba5d3596e35ca0b9513dded4b6383c0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wagner, U.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J006742/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
