Migrant workers are a valuable vantage point to explore current transformations in civil society and its role in fostering social justice, social cohesion and a fairer society. Migrant workers perform an important role in contemporary society and economy yet they are constructed as one of the key contemporary problems in current public and political discourse. Crucially, there are groups in civil society that are working, often at the grassroots level, to build cohesion from the bottom-up in communities and workplaces. Both research and practice in this area is currently fragmented. This seminar series brings together researchers and practitioners on the theme of 'Migrants, Workplace and Community', with the central aim of developing learning, for both academics and practitioners, from these innovations in civil society. The series comprises 9 one-day seminars over 3 years.

The central approach of the proposal of fertilising knowledge across disciplinary boundaries and across boundaries between academics and practitioners is shown in the make-up of the application team, which includes a key practitioner (the Director of Migrants' Rights Network), and academics from the backgrounds of business, employment relations, economic geography, sociology and migration studies. The proposal is also structured to develop research capacity by including PhD students and early career researchers. As well as bursaries being made available for PhD students for the seminars, there is one seminar (on methodological innovations and reflections) devoted to enhancing the learning and development of PhD students and early career researchers. The proposal is also designed to enhance international learning and collaboration. One seminar is devoted to uncovering the lessons for this area from the US, Europe and the Global South. In total, 6 international speakers will contribute to the series. 

The 9 seminar topics are:
1. Migrants, civil society and social cohesion: Issues, debates and practices in the context of international migration 
2. New forms of organizing and self-organizing of migrant workers across community and workplace. Lessons from the US, Europe and the Global South. 
3. Migrant workers initiatives and established labour organizations. 
4. Civil societal involvement in employment relations.
5. Civic and labour engagements as avenues for the integration and social cohesion of migrants: exploring the intersections of race, class and gender and marginalized identities 
6. Taking the king's shilling: when civil society is invited in. Irregular migrants, Civil society organisations and the state.
7. Researching civic and labour engagements in the context of migration and social cohesion: methodological innovations and reflections. 
8. Reflections on workplace, community, and society in the cultural production of migrants. 
9. 'How can we help?' Civic and labour practitioners' suggestions for academic research practice with greater impact. 

The series will lead to important outcomes for both academics and civil society practitioners. The series will inform the publication of special issues of two leading academic journals, in employment relations and in migration studies. It will also lead to the publication of a booklet for civil society practitioners (supported by a devoted website) outlining cases of best practice with regard to social cohesion and migrants at the intersection of workplace and community. Facilitated by a clear social media strategy, the series will also foster longer-term organic links among civil society groups, and between academics and civil society groups.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
The main beneficiaries of the series will be civil society groups currently involved in practices of integration of migrants and other vulnerable subjects. These groups include faith groups, trade unions (both large national ones such as UNITE and UNISON and small autonomous ones such as United Voices of the World), community organisations (such as Citizens UK and its city 'branches' in London, Nottingham, and Leeds) and migrants' groups. Several of our non-academic beneficiaries are groups linked to Migrants' Rights Network (whose Director is a co-applicant). The Migrants' Rights Network is a unique meta-group serving as a network forum for over 2,000 grassroots civil society groups of, and relating to, migrants. 

The other beneficiaries will be policy makers who at the local, regional and national level are involved with policies relating to fostering migrants' integration and promoting vibrant communities and social cohesion. 
Individuals and communities will also benefit from better policies and civil societal practices. 

How will they benefit?
The benefits of the seminar series can be grouped under three sub-headings central to the ESRC impact aims:

1. Improving social welfare and social cohesion
The series will lead to a cross-fertilisation of knowledge between civil society groups, and between civil society groups and academics, of forms of practice (and their outcomes) at the intersection between migrants, workplace and community. This will foster the development of best practice in this area. This will be formalised in the production of a booklet outlining cases of good practice and nine briefing documents to be distributed among relevant groups, and also captured within the linked website. Long term benefits will accrue from these relevant groups forming organic longer-term links with each other through the seminar series (facilitated by our social media strategy). Sharing best practice will contribute to greater integration of migrants at the grass-roots level, and hence will favour greater social cohesion.

For policy makers the seminar series will help in terms of bottom-up policy development. The series will create a forum for the development of best practice for the integration of migrants and the promotion of cohesion at the intersection between workplace and community. The policy implications of this will not be the need for new direct forms of state intervention, but in terms of helping create the conditions in which such civil society group activities can flourish. The above noted booklet relating to best practice and the seminars briefing documents will also have a target audience of policy makers. Policy makers will also be invited to the seminars.

Individuals and communities will benefit in the long run through better representation, integration and community cohesion.

2. Enhancing the research capacity, knowledge and skills of civil society organisations
Civil society groups participating in the series will directly benefit by enhancing their knowledge in this area. The website supporting the seminar series will serve as forum for the storage and distribution of relevant research - thus enhancing research capacity of relevant groups. The skills of civil society organisations will be developed through the enhancement of understanding of best practice in this area.

3. Enhancing cultural enrichment
One of the seminars is focused on the cultural productions (reflecting on workplace and community) of migrants themselves. This seminar will involve a workshop developing the participation of migrants and their group in this area. This will have the benefit of developing the cultural expressive skills of migrants and to disseminate academic findings and migrants' experiences to a wider audience. In the long run this contributes to the cultural enrichment of UK society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30008</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N009037/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>743BED39-2B13-4A4A-A6DA-806AA3D5A4E7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography/Pop Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>231B8162-9E4D-46FB-BB69-0A4B66598C2B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Employment Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46FB536B-9B51-49F1-B2DF-5A14789705F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Resource Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
