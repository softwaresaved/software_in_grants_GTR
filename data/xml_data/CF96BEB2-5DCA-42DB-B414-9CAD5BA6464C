Humankind needs to build on, dig through, observe, and depend upon the seabed, the uppermost few hundred metres of which are at the interface between the geological processes that occur below the seabed and the oceanographic, atmospheric, and environmental processes that occur above it. It is this near-surface part of the seabed that must be understood and relied upon when seafloor infrastructure is built, or cables and pipes are laid across oceans and seas.Recent work has shown that near-seabed sediments are elastically anisotropic. Seismic measurements of this anisotropy will provide a useful tool for observing small changes in the physical properties of these sediments and in the processes that affect them. Such properties include the state of stress and strain, the pore-fluid pressure, the presence and alignment of fractures, and the overall sediment permeability and competence. Quantifying changes in the seismic record over space or time would enable us to monitor processes such as slope stability and failure, subsidence, or stress build-up and release during the earthquake cycle, which can damage expensive seabed installations and pose a hazard to people and their environments.Shear-wave splitting is a particularly useful seismic expression of elastic anisotropy. However, we face two problems in analysing split shear waves in sediments near the seabed. The first problem is to generate and record shear waves at sea, which is usually done with a pressure-wave source at the sea-surface. The downgoing pressure waves mode-convert to upgoing shear waves beneath the seabed and are recorded on seafloor receivers. Unfortunately, however, the amount of shear-wave splitting is small for near-surface reflectors, typically a few milliseconds or less. This signal is about the same size as the effects of structural heterogeneity and anisotropy and heterogeneity of the pressure-wave sound-speed profile in the ocean and seabed. The second problem is thus one of signal separation and precision of measurement, which becomes increasingly important and problematic as signal frequency or the ratio of pressure-to-shear pathlengths increases. Current methods work adequately for reservoir rocks many kilometers beneath the seabed, but do not properly account for pressure-wave and reflector effects, so have limited precision and do not work well for the near-surface.The proposed research will develop a powerful new method for isolating the shear-wave splitting from interfering pressure-wave and reflector effects. A feasibility study indicates that the new methodology is unusually robust and will lead to unparalleled levels of precision in measurement. Funding is sought to develop this new method and apply it to data from three sites around the north Atlantic. The high levels of precision achieved by this method are of interest to: (1) geotechnical engineers planning to build on, develop, or otherwise perturb the seabed, since improved site surveying and monitoring techniques will increase site safety and longevity, and reduce negative impacts on the surrounding environment; (2) geoscientists trying to understand the causes and effects of physical processes occurring in the seabed; (3) geophysicists and reservoir engineers seeking to increase the precision and reliability with which elastic anisotropy is mapped in their reservoirs as a proxy for fracture orientation and intensity, thus maximizing production efficiency. The research is particularly timely given the current efforts in Canada, the US, and Europe to build large seafloor observatory networks for scientific research, and given our ongoing efforts to decrease the costs and consequences of energy supply and consumption.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries in the energy industry start with oilfield services companies working with ocean-bottom seismic data (the data used in this proposal). Their services are sold to production companies such as international oil majors. Ocean-bottom seismic methods complement traditional technology for understanding oil and gas reservoirs, and thus help exploit commercial reserves more efficiently. Interest is mainly in technology for processing and understanding ocean-bottom seismic data overall (which this proposal advances), and in using shear-wave splitting to map proxies for permeability in reservoirs (a direct application of the research proposed here). Further beneficiaries include geotechnical engineers building seabed infrastructure. The research benefits their site survey and design capabilities by enhanced remote detection of physical properties of the seabed, and by enabling important changes in the seabed around their installations to be monitored. The same is true on slopes and rises that endanger the installations through potential failure and collapse. Beneficiaries also include scientists who map or monitor physical properties in the seabed to learn more about the processes in the Earth that drive them (e.g. pore-fluid pressure changes during the earthquake cycle, mapping of stress and strain around tectonic or morphologic features, or detecting and mapping fractures that enable natural gases and liquids to migrate through the seabed). The three groups identified above pass the benefit of the research on in several ways. Firstly, through better understanding and monitoring of site conditions, which increases job-related safety on marine building projects. Secondly, through improved monitoring, prediction and mitigation of hazards to coastal environments and populations that may arise through human activity on the seabed. Thirdly, through more efficient exploitation of oilfield resources that builds wealth by increased tax revenue, by reducing the cost of energy, by decreasing reliance on dirtier forms of energy, and by increasing energy security. Fourthly, through advances in understanding and monitoring geological processes that help governments to plan for and react to natural hazards (e.g. earthquakes), industries to make informed geographic or geological decisions (e.g. site selection), and cost potential damage from geological events more accurately (e.g. repair costs for dams or powerplants). The key change in the realization of these benefits is in the increased precision and reliability of shear-wave splitting measurements that follow from the proposed research. Benefits to the energy industry will be quickly embraced (one to three years) as they are well placed and keen to exploit technology advances in this area. Application to geotechnical engineering may be slower (two to four years), but will be accelerated by success at reservoir depths. Publishing the results of this work in relevant peer-reviewed journals (e.g. Geophysics, Near-Surface Geophysics) is paramount. It is also important to present results in conference proceedings and non-reviewed periodicals that are widely read by scientists in industry (e.g. The Leading Edge, Ground Engineering Magazine). Forums that will be used to present the results include meetings of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers, Society of Exploration Geophysicists or the Offshore Technology Conference. The applicant will contact targeted industry groups in the oilfield services sector and offer to present the results of the research and to seek opportunity for collaboration and further support. The software and algorithms will be made freely available to interested parties in order to facilitate take-up and application of the research outputs. A web presence at the applicant's host organization will be constructed to distribute the codes, documentation and examples, and to provide a route for beneficiaries to contact the applicant.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>53807</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H018573/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5AAD42DB-C6CB-4B09-8555-8ECA565B6B59</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ground Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
