There is a perception that some activities are too risky for local authorities to undertake, and that others must be managed defensively. This comparative research project will investigate the growth in claims against local authorities in Scotland and Ireland and examine how local authorities respond through the management of liability risks in one aspect of their activities - the maintenance of roads and pavements. The objective is to secure a better understanding of the level of liability risk to which local authorities are exposed and how the management of risks might impact positively or negatively on their performance in delivery of public services.

In addition to the law of negligence itself, public audit regimes, the insurance market and professional networks of public officials also make a difference to how public authorities respond to the liability risks associated with service delivery.



Public authority responses to liability risks may focus on:

a) reducing the likelihood of liability arising; and/or on 

b) limiting its impact when it occurs. 



The nature and character of the legal, financial and professional environments in which public authorities operate affects the extent to which they focus on (1) reducing the likelihood of liability occurring; and (2) minimising its impact when it occurs. 



Reducing the likelihood of liability arising may be achieved both by:

a) actions targeted at reducing the likelihood of public harm (including ceasing certain activities); and by

b) 'creative legal compliance' whereby the likelihood of liability arising is reduced while not correspondingly reducing the likelihood of public harm.



Limiting the impact of liability when it occurs is achieved mainly through liability insurance, though robust claims management practices may also reduce the financial costs of liability.



Professional standards of good practice, affirmed by the courts and encouraged by professional networks, public auditors and the insurance market, may foster a sense of certainty on the part of public authorities about how to comply with legal standards of care. They may also increase the legal compliance of public authorities. Negligence law under these conditions may regulate effectively without extensive resort to the courts. Such 'regulatory' effects are more likely, however, where there is a synergy between legal and professional values. Further, increased legal certainty also increases the risk of practices of 'creative compliance'.



Claims that Scotland and Ireland are witnessing a 'compensation culture' in terms of spiralling claims-making seem exaggerated in relation to the roads domain. Claiming rates appear to have been broadly stable over the last decade.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project offer a rare qualitative image of how risks of liability may be managed within public service delivery. All those involved in public service delivery (sectors highlighted below), particularly those concerned with the potential negative effects of negligence liability on the delivery of public services, have something to learn from our study. Our findings, published through high profile international journals, have now entered the established literature on the relationships between government action and tortious liability. The pathways to impact are, thus, likely to be mainly indirect, through the use our research by other scholars in their own engagement the questions we addressed in the roads sector. Having said that, our work was referenced by the Law Commission early on in the project, in its Consultation Paper (No. 187) on 'Administrative Redress: Public Bodies and the Citizen'. This is a much more policy-directed publication and should help our findings to reach policy-makers directly.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3649CFD0-2A01-471E-B49A-761CAE403126</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D8DAB44E-7F13-4036-B168-8DEB408D10B9"><gtr:id>D8DAB44E-7F13-4036-B168-8DEB408D10B9</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Public Management of Liability Risks</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oxford Journal of Legal Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bb344e41e7690c99722b926c3fdb0594"><gtr:id>bb344e41e7690c99722b926c3fdb0594</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Halliday S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8273B4CF-2CCF-4EA3-9588-061DB1C88BC0"><gtr:id>8273B4CF-2CCF-4EA3-9588-061DB1C88BC0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Commodification of Compensation?
