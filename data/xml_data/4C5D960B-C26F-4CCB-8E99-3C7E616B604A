Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/I004637/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Systems biology is a biology-based inter-disciplinary study field combining experimental investigations and computational modeling to discover emergent properties of complex interactions in biological systems. SysMO is a European trans-national funding and research initiative on 'Systems Biology of Microorganisms'. The initiative's goal is to record and describe the dynamic molecular processes that occur in microorganisms in a comprehensive way and to present these processes in the form of computerized mathematical models. Each project is made up of a consortium of European institutions and each works towards different research outcomes on a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea (single-celled microorganisms) and yeast. The environmental conditions for each organism vary, growing in culture, soil, water and animal hosts. This diversity means that there are many different kinds of models and many different types of data collected. The SysMO initiative has been divided into two phases: SysMO1 funded eleven projects and 91 institutions; SysMO2 will fund seven projects, five of which are project continuations from phase 2 (so six projects are concluded) and two of which are new. The research outcomes (models, data, procedures), and the know-how and best practice developed by the scientists, are to be managed and pooled in order to: benefit the members of the programme during the running of the projects; disseminate and publish the results to the wider scientific community; and safeguard the results after the completion of the projects that maximises the 'shelf life' and utility of data generated by SysMO. SysMO-DB is a project to build and manage an incrementally developed web-based software platform to achieve this. SysMO-DB1, funded during the first phase, begun the development of a web-based platform - called the SEEK - for cataloguing the different outcomes of the projects, archiving data, procedures and models and integrating with the different project's local data management systems, including the standardisation of the information used to describe the data and models and the handling of project spreadsheets. The SEEK also includes a social network for the SysMO members and integrates with public repositories for data, models, analyses and publications such as JWS Online (for models); SABIO-RK (for data), myExperiment (for bioinformatics data analysis pipelines) and PubMed (for publications). SysMO-DB has also developed effective practices for working with SysMO scientists through the founding of a PALs focus group of researchers who shape the developments, data standards and protocols necessary for pooling and promote SEEK adoption in their own projects. The focus of SysMO-DB1 is on supporting the current projects. SysMO-DB2 continues and extends the work to cope with SysMO-phase changes and life after beyond and after SysMO: new and terminating projects, personnel change, publication outside the consortium and long-term preservation of results. SysMO-DB2 also plans to package up the software and methods so that they can be adopted and sustained by other programmes such as EraSysBio+. EraSysBio+ is a pan-European programme for 16 Systems Biology projects. It is similar in organisation to SysMO but radically different in terms of scope. Hence it differs in the data, model and process capabilities needed. As part of widening the adoption of the SysMO-DB approach the project will support EraSysBio+ in its first 18 months. The two projects from EraSysBio+ that focus on microorganisms will be fully integrated into the SysMO-DB work programme. For the full range of EraSysBio+ projects SysMO-DB2 will instantiate a new instance of the SEEK, provide advice and help launch a PALs scheme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>SysMO is a European trans-national funding and research initiative on 'Systems Biology of Microorganisms'. The initiative's goal is to record and describe the dynamic molecular processes that occur in microorganisms in a comprehensive way and to present these processes in the form of computerized mathematical models. Each project is made up of a consortium of European institutions and each works towards different research outcomes on a variety of microorganisms under a variety of conditions leading to different kinds of models and different types of data collected. Phase 1, SysMO1, funded 11 projects. In phase 2, SysMO2 funds 7 projects, 5 continuations (6 projects are terminated) and 2 new. The SysMO-DB project aims to create and deploy a lightweight, technical infrastructure in order to: (i) pool the SysMO research capacities and its members' know-how, (ii) enable dissemination of results within and between projects, between participants, and to the scientific community, and (iii) support SysMO researchers in their routine work to manage their data, models and processes. SysMO-DB, addresses challenges in 5 areas: (i) developing and releasing the SysMO-DB SEEK software platform; (ii) managing the SEEK service; (iii) defining data exchange models, controlled vocabularies and curating models; (iv) establishing a strong user community engagement through a focus group of PALS; and (v) promoting adoption and sustaining the SEEK software, service and community. SysMO-DB2 extends the work to cope with new and terminating projects changes, long-term preservation and life beyond and after SysMO. SysMO-DB2 will package up the software and methods to be adoptable by other programmes such as EraSysBio+, pan-European programme for 16 Systems Biology projects. SysMO-DB2 will instantiate an EraSysBio+ instance of the SEEK, provide advice and help launch a PALs scheme. Two micro-organism projects will be fully integrated into the SysMO-DB.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>SysMO-DB is about rapidly, retrospectively and sensitively creating and deploying a lightweight, technical infrastructure in order to: (i) pool the SysMO research capacities and its members' know-how, (ii) enable a seamless dissemination of results within and between projects, between participants of the model-hypothesis-experiment-model systems biology cycle, and to the scientific community, (iii) support SysMO researchers in their routine work to manage their data, models and SOPs and the data, models and SOPs relevant to their work. Currently SysMO-DB is an inward-looking, gated community. By the end of SysMO2 must be outward-looking and open to wider membership and public access in order to make the greatest impact outside the bounds of the SysMO partners. The expected outcome is an information exchange system for Systems Biology in Europe that: (i) works and is adopted and used; (ii) matches the practical needs of experimentalists and modellers and helps them work together; (iii) has a network of people who know how to use it and who spread the word about it; and (iv) is adopted by other programmes and communities. Thus the objectives of the proposal are targeted at ensuring, enabling and driving impact for many stakeholders: for the SysMO projects, for academic and industrial researchers outside the programme and for organisations and initiatives that need a similar information platform. Computer scientists will benefit from an opportunity to deploy Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 technologies in the field. The stakeholders will benefit in a number of ways. SysMO members will have a safe haven for their data, assistence and training in data and model metadata management, access to modern, labour-saviing bioinformatics technologies such as workflows, access to previously unrecognised resources and access to new techniques for data comparison, model validation etc. They will benefit from the visibility of, and access to, pooled assets and membership of a social network of researchers and their capabilities. This latter point could lead to new means of forming cooperations. The managers of public repositories will benefit from well curated assets that are suitably fit for deposition at the point of publication, and the SysMO members benefit from a new publication route. Managers and participants of similar intiatives will benefit from access to new technology and a new platform that they can deploy and adapt. Researchers outside SysMO will benefit from the secured results of SysMO. Thus the Systems Biology research community will benefit from advances in technology and knowledge for new avenues of work and collaboration. The proposal intrinsically incorporates a plan to ensure impact broadily categorised into these areas. - The platform itself for the exchange of SysMO outcomes during the initiative and the preservation of outcomes at each projects' completion - The development of the platform such that it can be readily sustained after the project ends, and readily extended and adopted by other initiatives - The PALS and programme of user engagement to ensure that the platform is fit for purpose and the SysMO community (and beyond) are capable of adopting it - A programme of dissemination of the SysMO-DB SEEK platform and the development of cooperations with key stakeholders such as the EMBL-EBI 'omics data resource managers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>950271</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies</gtr:description><gtr:id>18EE7264-722D-49E9-A79D-94162CF0CD8A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See the outputs and outcomes arising from the SysMO-DB1 and SysMO-DB2 BBSRC awards.

The SysMO-SEEK resource continues to be used by over half the SysMO projects, even after the funds, the programmes and the projects ended. Many groups are including the platform in their new grant proposals. We have successfully retained the outcomes of the SysMO 1and 2 programmes.

The platform was been adopted by 10+ independent projects (e.g. Unicellsys, JenAge, RosAge, SBCancer, Sybacol projects) and local group instances have been established at the VU Amsterdam for Yeast Glycolysis, Systems Science for Health in Birmingham and Magdeburg Centre for Systems Biology. Commercially, SEEK is a component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's ElasticAP platform. 

Since the establishment of the FAIRDOM project (partially funded by the DMMCore BBSRC award) 38 projects now use the FAIRDOMHub (a public Commons which subsumes the SysMO and ERASysAPP SEEKs) and 30 projects use the software platform in their own instances. 
the platform forms part of the German de.NBI bionformatics infrastructure and has been adopted by two UK Synthetic Biology Centres. See DMMCore entry.

Work on the SysMO-DB project directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area.

The SysMO-DB project has also directly lead to the FAIRDOM project (BBSRC DMMCore BBSRC award), a consortium of 4 EU funding councils to: Establish a sustainable European Infrastructure to extend the network services to the wider European systems biology community; Develop the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for systems biology project, building on SEEK and openBIS (SystemsX); and document and disseminate the outcomes and activities to funding agencies, projects and centres with the goal of establishing a sustainable business model for this infrastructure.

The JWS Online Sys Bio model database and simulation system continues to offer data and simulation facilities.

The PALs knowledge network and the workshop/tutorial programme have been adopted by other projects - notably the Dutch DTL Centre and the German Virtual Liver Network. the knowledge network is being extended through the FAIRDOM Initiative, partially funded by the BBSRC DMMCOre Award.

Our work on COMBINE (MIRIAM, SED-ML) and ISA standards is adopted by the wider community for data and model management.

The SEEK platform has also been adopted outside of Sys Bio. The software platform underpins the EU Biodiversity Virtual eLaboratory Portal (http://www.biovel.eu) and the Manchester Web Ergonomics Laboratory. 

The RightField platform has been adopted in archaeology, cultural studies and environmental sciences. It forms the basis of the Populous Ontology development tool (http://www.e-lico.eu/populous.html).

It established and continued to develop and support a data, model and SOP management platform to support the long-term retention, exchange, sharing and publishing of the outcomes of the multi-partner projects of the first and second round of the ERANet SysMO (Systems Biology for MicroOrganisms, http://sysmo.net/) programme and selected projects of the ERASysBio+ programme.

In partnership with HITS, Heidelberg, the project:
- further developed the SEEK platform for the lightweight management of data, models and SOPs in Systems Biology (http://www.seek4science.org). This has functionalities for project management (yellow pages), organising outcomes using the ISA framework, catalogues ad repositories for digital assets arising from Sys Bio research, seamless integration with Sys Bio simulators and gateways to third party data archives. It is standards driven.

- further developed the SysMO-SEEK and established the EraSysBio SEEK resources for the projects to register, interlink, retain and share their results (http://https://seek.sysmo-db.org/)

- continued to develop a methodology for lightweight data gathering using Just Enough Results Model (JERM)

- further developed tools (Rightfield, http://www.rightfield.org.uk) for making JERM templates and spreadsheet tools to help biologists with data curation

- further developed the JWS Online Sys Bio model database and simulation system.

- ran summer schools, workshops, tutorials and training programmes

- extended and ran a PALs knowledge network of young researchers in the SysMO projects who became skilled data managers, champions and scouts for the platform.

- assisted projects to curate their data and models, with over 70 site visits in total

- participated in Sys Bio Standards activities, notably the COMBINE and ISA standards.

Briefings in Bioinformatics 2012 stated that Out of the box it provides the most useful features for large scale biology projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The SEEK platform is open source and freely available, as is the Rightfield metadata collection tool suite. See the product entries for up to date figures.

The SEEK was adopted by 14/15 of the SysMO 1 and 2 projects and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the Virtual Liver Network, ERANet ERASysBio+ projects, and the ERANet ERASysAPP. 

By the end of the SysMODB project the platform had been adopted by 10+ independent projects (e.g. Unicellsys, JenAge, RosAge, SBCancer, Sybacol) and local group instances have been established at the VU Amsterdam for Yeast Glycolysis, Systems Science for Health in Birmingham and Magdeburg Centre for Systems Biology.
Commercially, SEEK is a component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's eaglecore platform. 

Since the establishment of the follow-on FAIRDOM project (partially funded by the DMMCore BBSRC award) 58 projects now use the FAIRDOMHub (a public Commons which subsumes the SysMO and ERASysAPP SEEKs) and 30 projects use the software platform in their own instances, including large EU projects, projects as part of the German de.NBI network, and 4 national projects in Norway. The USA's Pacific North Western Laboratory is also a user.

The SEEK platform has also been adopted outside of Sys Bio. The software platform underpins the EU Biodiversity Virtual eLaboratory Portal (http://www.biovel.eu), and the Manchester Web Ergonomics Laboratory.

Notably, two of the BBSRC SynBio Centres use the SEEK as their data/model/SOP Platform.

Wruck et al. Data management strategies for multinational large-scale systems biology projects. Briefings in Bioinformatics 2012 stated that 'Out of the box it provides the most useful features for large scale biology projects.'

The SysMO-SEEK resource continues to be used by over half the SysMO projects, even after the funds, the programmes and the projects ended. Many groups are including the platform in their new grant proposals. 

The JWS Online Sys Bio model database and simulation system continues to offer data and simulation facilities.

The PALs knowledge network and the workshop/tutorial programme have been adopted by other projects and forms the core of the FAIRDOM capacity and knowledge network (http://www.fair-dom.org).

Our work in COMBINE and ISA standards is adopted by the wider community for data and model management.

Work on the SysMO-DB project directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe (http://project.isbe.eu), and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. The team wrote the ISBE data management strategy. The SEEK software and the FAIRDOMHub (the follow-on to the SysMO-DB SEEK which consolidates the public data commons arising from the SysMO-DB projects) are pillars of the ISBE Light Interim research infrastructure. the FAIRDOM people commons (its yellow pages) will be merged with the ISBE Community, and the FAIDOM Knowledge Hub forms the basis of the ISBE stewardship knowledge resources.

This also contributes to Systems Biology management policies, practices and infrastructure associated with the RI ELIXIR. Goble is a PI of ELIXIR-UK. 

The SysMO-DB project has also directly lead to the FAIRDOM project, a consortium of 4 EU funding councils to: Establish a sustainable European Infrastructure to extend the network services to the wider European systems biology community; Develop the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for systems biology project, building on SEEK and openBIS (SystemsX); and document and disseminate the outcomes and activities to funding agencies, projects and centres with the goal of establishing a sustainable business model for this infrastructure.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1F10DEEA-5C2E-45BE-9237-AF034D71C084</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sysmo-db.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>RightField is an open-source tool for adding ontology term selection to Excel spreadsheets.

Construct your own model
With the new JWS Online model builder you can build a model from scratch using a simple interface. Models can be simulated directly in the JWS Online simulator. The builder adheres very closely to the SBML model specification and supports the MIRIAM and SBO standards for annotation, and provides a useful online annotation tool.

Simulate models
Simulate curated kinetic models from the JWS Online database, or non-curated models built or uploaded to JWS Online. JWS Online supports time evolutions, steady-state simulations, structural analysis, metabolic-control analysis, parameter scans, and reaction plots.

SBML compliant
JWS Online now uses a database implementation with a native format that mirrors the SBML specification. This minimises changes in SBML structure during the upload-edit-save cycle. JWS Online supports uploading and modification of existing models in SBML or JWS format.

Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.
SEEK is incorporating semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.</gtr:description><gtr:id>245A63C4-62EB-40B6-BCFF-47E274EFB57F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The SEEK4Science platform was adopted by the all of the ERANet SysMO I and II projects it was designed for and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the German Virtual Liver Network and its follow-on Liver Systems Medicine project, ERANet's ERASysBio+ projects, and ERASysAPP. 
The Platform is now developed under the FAIRDOM Initiative (funded by the DMMCore project partners, including the BBSRC) http://www.fair-dom.org.

The software platform has been independently adopted by 30+ groups in Europe, Russia, South Africa, USA, and the UK. EU Projects that adopt the platform include: EmPowerPutida and Mycosynvac; national projects include the German Systems Medicine for Liver project and the de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network, and the Norway's Digital Life programme. The platform has been adopted by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA. Combined with the openBIS system, it is the platform for two UK Synthetic Biology Centre's data management (SynBioChem and SynthSys). 

58 projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub.org Commons, a centralised public community instance of the SEEK4Science Platform. 
Work on the SysMO-DB project and the SEEK directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE Light - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. 

The SEEK4Science software and associated software, FAIRDOMHub Commons and its support services form a core pillar of the ISBE Light Interim phase. 

Commercially, SEEK was the prototype component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's eaglecore platform and is currently being reviewed by 3 commercial organisations.
