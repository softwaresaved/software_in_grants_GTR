This problem is compounded by extreme wet-dry weather cycles induced by rapid climate change, which alters both soil structure and nutrient availability leading to yield reduction in staple and cash crops. These factors combine to present a significant problem for agriculture in both developed and developing countries. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop a new range of crops that can maintain or indeed increase yields in the face of worsening conditions and reduction in the availability and use of fertilisers and pesticides. In order to manipulate and improve plant responses to environmental changes and external mechanical forces we need to evaluate the most important physical and biochemical factors responsible for plant cell biomechanics and for the growth limitation of plant tissues.

The mechanical properties and growth of plant tissues are strongly determined by the structure of the cell wall (the main structural feature of plant cells) and the adhesion between the cells. The high complexity of the microstructure and biochemical processes in the cell wall requires mathematical modelling at the scale of its structural elements to help to close some gaps in the experimentally obtained understanding of the plant mechanics and biochemistry. New mathematical microscopic models for biomechanics of the plant cell wall and tissue will be developed in this project. A microscopic model on the scale of cell wall microfibrils will allow us to consider non-homogeneous distributions of cell wall structural elements and the biochemical interactions between them, as well as changes in the microstructure in response to internal and external stimuli.

As there are thousands of microfibrils in a cell wall and of cells in a plant tissue, effective numerical simulations of the complex microscopic models on the time and length scales of practical interest are not possible and asymptotic analysis techniques need to be applied. The techniques of periodic and locally-periodic homogenisation will be generalised to address non-periodic microstructures of plant cell walls and tissues. By applying asymptotical analysis, the macroscopic properties of plant tissues will be defined from the microscopic description of biochemical and mechanical processes. This multiscale approach and analysis of the macroscopic model will enable us to predict the influence of microscopic interactions on the macroscopic mechanical behaviour.

The new modelling and analytical approaches to be developed in this project will help us to better understand the biomechanics of plant cells and the influence of external mechanical forces on bioche- mical processes inside plant cells. The analytical and numerical results of the mathematical models combined with data from biological experiments will help us to identify new approaches to select, breed and genetically engineer improved cultivars. A better understanding of plant cell biomechanics will enable experimentalists to manipulate plant cell wall properties which in turn will lead to an improvement in the efficiency of wood, paper and biofuel production.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed fundamental mathematical research, devoted to the development of new modelling approaches and multiscale analysis techniques, will find its path toward impact on society and economy through collaboration with experimentalists in biology and engineering. The biologically-focussed modelling and analysis will impact the agricultural sector, whilst development of new multiscale analysis techniques will lead to improvement in engineering material performance with beneficial consequences for environment and commercial profitability.

Direct collaboration with experimental groups at The James Hutton Institute working with plant breeders, and interactions with research groups in the College of Life Sciences, Universities of Dundee, studying lignin biosynthesis in the context of biofuel production, will facilitate and ensure the pathway to impact of the proposed research on the society and economy. Both collaborating institutions have direct connections with the industrial and commercial sectors. Discussions with experimentalists in concrete research in the Civil Engineering Department, University of Dundee, and establishing new collaborations with research groups and companies in biomimetics will link the multiscale analysis techniques with the design of new engineering materials. Presentation of the results obtained from the multiscale modelling and analysis to experimental and industrial communities at both national and international conferences and workshops will support the transfer of knowledge and expertise. 

There are several ways in which this research will directly contribute to industry-relevant problems:

1. Mathematical modelling of the mechanical properties of plant cells and tissues will give new insights into the control mechanisms of the root growth process and will help experimental biologists to specify the beneficial root traits to select crops ideal for problematic soils and to enhance agricultural efficiency in regions with degraded, hard and unproductive soil. 
 
2. A better understanding of pectin biochemistry will help to manipulate the quality of pectin in plants and will contribute to more efficient production of pectin as a food ingredient. 
 
3. The new knowledge obtained from the mathematical modelling of plant cell walls and changes in the microscopic properties in response to external and internal stimuli will provide new ideas for the possible manipulation of cell wall structural and mechanical properties and impact the efficiency and quality of pulps, paper, wood, and biofuel production. 
 
4. Studies of the influence of the hierarchical microstructure of plant tissues on their mechanical performance will help to improve the development and production of innovative composite materials. 

5. The multiscale analysis techniques that will be developed here, when applied to models describing sound and temperature propagation through concrete walls could provide a quantitative relationship between the microscopic structure and propagation impedance and allow the thermal and acoustic isolation of building materials to be optimised. This will have positive consequences for environment and quality of life. 

In the context of food production for the growing world population the impact of the proposed work has also an essential international aspect and is especially important for developing countries. 

The topic of the proposed research is of wide interest and its dissemination to the public will raise awareness of the innovation and impact of applied mathematical research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93761</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Heidelberg</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with COS, University of Heidelberg</gtr:description><gtr:id>3335D2BD-3AAB-4DDA-9AE1-01C53F102678</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multi-disciplinary collaboration between a biologist and a mathematician.

We were awarded the main auditorium at the Dundee Science Centre and in total 16 staff manned 10 separate display stations. Our visitors (kids and adults) had the opportunity to learn how mathematics is used to better understand the world around us. They were fascinated to hear that mathematical research is used to improve not only the cancer treatment, but also crop and biofuel production. Hands-on activities, films, and numerical simulations were used to present our research to the general public. The event had positive impact on the general public's interest in mathematical research.

Feedback has highlighted the popularity and effectiveness of this approach of using hands-on exhibits, physical and virtual, that introduce mathematical concepts in a fun and interactive way and provide a starting point to explore mathematical ideas.

Our Maths Event at Dundee Science Festival increased the interest of general public in studying Mathematical and in mathematical research. This event also provided our visitors the possibility to see how much mathematics is in the world around us and how mathematical methods can help to solve some real world problems.

Numerical simulations, the app for conforming and non-conforming maps (transformations) which were applied by D'Arcy Thompson on plants and animals to show similarities in their morphologies, many different mathematical games were used to present the main ideas of the research of D'Arcy Thompson and of the research in Mathematical Biology at the Division of Mathematics, University of Dundee. 
Many visitors of the event and many questions indicated the interest of the general public in the research in Mathematical Biology. 
Banners and a movie describing the research in Mathematical Biology at the Division of Mathematics, University of Dundee, were displayed through the whole time of the exhibition (21 Aug 2015 - 25 Oct 2015).

The mechanical properties and growth of plants are strongly determined by plant cell walls, that have a complex microstructure composed of thousands of microfibrils embedded in the cell wall matrix of proteins and polymers (hemicellulose and pectins). Thus, to analyse the mechanical properties and growth of plant tissues, it is important to consider microscopic modelling approach and to describe microstructure, chemical processes, and mechanical deformations of cell walls and tissues on the scale of microfibrils. Multiscale analysis techniques are then applied to derive macroscopic properties and behaviour of plant cell walls and tissues from the microscopic description of the physical and/or biological processes. 
The multiscale analysis (homogenization) methods (two-scale convergence on surfaces of locally periodic microstructures and locally periodic unfolding methods), developed here, allow us to consider a wide range of non-periodic microstructures. Using this new methods we analysed a nonlinear model describing biological processes (cell signalling processes) in a perforated domain (extracellular space) with non-periodical distribution of perforations (cells).
In our novel microscopic models for plant cell wall and tissue biomechanics we consider the interactions between chemical processes (calcium-pectin chemistry) in cell walls and the elastic/viscoelastic deformations on the scale of cell wall microfibrils. Applying the homogenization techniques we derived macroscopic models describing the effective (macroscopic) mechanical properties of cell walls and tissues. Numerical simulations of the macroscopic models are used to analyse how the changes in biochemical processes influence the mechanical properties of cell walls and tissues and how mechanical forces affect chemical reactions inside the cell walls. For numerical simulations we used Finite Element Methods implemented in FEniCS and DUNE. The large difference in the elastic properties of cell wall matrix and microfibrils required a rigorous derivation and careful numerical calculations of macroscopic elastic properties of cell walls. It was observed that the patterns in the distribution of load-bearing (calcium-pectin) cross-links in the cell wall matrix depend on the microstructure and heterogeneous distribution of mechanical forces (stresses) in plant cell walls and tissues. Using the mathematical model we also analysed the impact of microfibrils orientation in upper and lower parts of plant root cell walls (difficult to visualise and analyse experimentally) on mechanical properties of plant tissues. Our analysis showed that the microfibrils orientation in upper and lower parts of root cell walls is important in the presence of tissue tension. 
This research was conducted in the collaboration with the James Hutton Institute, UK and Centre for Organismal Studies, University of Heidelberg, Germany. Our microscopic modelling of plant cell wall biomechanics attracted interest from molecular biologists, resulting in an invitation to write a book chapter on mathematical modelling of calcium-pectin chemistry and creating an avenue for possible new collaborations with Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK. 
The research of this project was presented to general public on the Maths Events at Dundee Science Festival, Women in Science Festival and D'Arcy Thompson Exhibition at Dundee Science Centre.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The generalised homogenization methods (two-scale convergence on surfaces of locally periodic microstructures and locally periodic unfolding methods) developed in this project will be used by researchers from the mathematics, physics and engineering communities to analyse the influence of the microstructure on the macroscopic behaviour of biological and engineering materials and to compute the macroscopic properties of composite materials with non-periodic microstructures. A better understanding of relations between microstructure and macroscopic behaviour will provide new ideas for the engineering companies to design improved composite materials. 
The derivation, multiscale analysis and numerical simulations of our mathematical models for plant cell wall and tissue biomechanics on the scale of cell wall microfibrils attracted interest from researchers in plant biology. Our multiscale models will be used to analyse experimental results on plant tissue biomechanics and to better understand the compensatory mechanisms and the interplay between biochemistry and mechanics. The mutilscale mathematical models for plant tissue biomechanics allow us to analyse the interactions between external forces and biochemical processes in cell walls. This will be used to analyse the experiments on plant root growth impedance to better understand the mechanisms underlying the root growth impedance caused by hard soil. The gained understanding will help plant breeders to identify novel approached to select and breed improved cultivars, which then, through the agricultural sector, will result in production of high-yield crops.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DBDEE7AB-7D52-4C93-87BE-882DA6958C2A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Construction,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.maths.dundee.ac.uk/mptashnyk/List_Public.shtml</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Novel mathematical models for plant cell wall and tissue biomechanics are derived and analysed. In the microscopic model for cell wall biomechanics the interactions between chemical processes in a plant cell wall and its mechanical properties are defined on the scale of cell wall microfibrils. Using homogenisation techniques the macroscopic model for cell wall biomechanics is derived. In the microscopic model for plant tissue biomechanics we considered the chemical processes and mechanical deformations on the scale of plant cells. Then using the homogenization techniques we derived the macroscopic model for plant tissue biomechanics. This multiscale approach and analysis of the macroscopic models allow us to define the influence of microscopic interactions and heterogeneity of cell wall matrix and plant tissue on the patterns in the dynamics of chemical processes and on the macroscopic mechanical deformations of plant cell walls and tissues. Numerical codes for simulations of the macroscopic mathematical models for plant cell wall biomechanics were written using the free softwares FEniCs and DUNE (Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment).</gtr:description><gtr:id>45DEC77C-E3FA-451F-BC04-59946C3716D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The analysis of the mathematical models and comparison of numerical solutions of the mathematical models with experimental results will allow us to better understand the mechanisms controlling plant growth and development at the cellular level and give new insight into how plants respond to changes in environmental stresses.
