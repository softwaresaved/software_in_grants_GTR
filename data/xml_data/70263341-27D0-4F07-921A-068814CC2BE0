From antiquity, when the problem might have been to find the perimeter that enclosed the largest area of land, to the most sophisticated application nowadays, a complete solution to such problems always opens large horizons for applications and is intrinsically interesting to mathematicians, as it translates usually into hard and often technical questions. But the answers impact applications and everyday life, as in the example above.

In particular, in classical Calculus of Variations one seeks to minimise a functional defined on a class of maps, typically such functionals are integrals and model some &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot;. The extrema of these functionals satisfy a certain system of PDE (Partial Differential Equations) known as the Euler-Lagrange equations. 

In the early 1960s G. Aronsson initiated the study of functionals which are instead defined as a maximum. Except for the intrinsic mathematical interest connected to geometric problems, minimising the &amp;quot;max&amp;quot; of an energy provides more realistic models as opposed to the classical case of the &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; energy. &amp;quot;Calculus of Variations in L-infinity&amp;quot;, as this area is known today, has undergone huge development since. However, until recently the theory was restricted exclusively to the scalar case and to first order variational problems (involving minimisation of the map and its first derivatives). 

In the early 2010s the PI pioneered the study of vectorial L-infinity problems for maps valued in higher-dimensional spaces and involving perhaps higher order derivatives. The vectorial case is of interest to a large number of real-world applications. The main reason that hindered the development of the vector case was the absence of the appropriate analytic framework: the new complicated equations possess singular &amp;quot;solutions&amp;quot; and a theory is needed in order to make rigorous sense and to be studied effectively. The problem is that standard PDE approaches based on either duality/integration-by-parts or on the maximum principle do not apply. In particular, the systems arising are non-divergence, highly nonlinear, degenerate and with discontinuous coefficients. The situation is analogous to that the mathematical community faced in the 1910s when attempting to understand and make rigorous sense of the &amp;quot;Dirac Delta&amp;quot; which arose in Quantum Theory. The development of the theory of &amp;quot;generalised functions&amp;quot; allowed the understanding of fundamental physical phenomena.

Motivated by the newly discovered equations, the PI very recently proposed a novel theory of &amp;quot;generalised solutions&amp;quot; for fully nonlinear PDE systems of any order which allows for discontinuous solutions and coefficients. This approach is duality-free and relies on the probabilistic interpretation of those derivatives which do not exist classically. Our theory is a nonlinear alternative to distributions compatible with all existing approaches. In this setting, the PI has recently begun studying successfully certain cases of the L-infinity equations. 

The proposed research will continue the study of L-infinity variational problems and of their equations in the proper analytic framework. We are interested in developing new mathematical tools in order to study 1st and 2nd order variational problems and the associated PDE systems. A further particular focus will be to apply our results to models of variational Data Assimilation in Earth sciences and in weather forecasting. Mathematically, Data Assimilation faces problems which are not exactly solvable and instead one tries to minimise an &amp;quot;error&amp;quot; which describes the deviation of approximate solutions from being the exact solution we would like to have. By replacing the standard models currently used with their &amp;quot;max&amp;quot; counterparts, we could obtain better predictions: spikes of large errors are at the outset excluded when minimising the maximum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will have several beneficiaries in the academic, industrial and commercial world with an expected potentially enormous impact. Specifically:

Mathematical community: The present project will focus on the development of Calculus of Variations for supremal functionals, an intrinsically fundamental topic in Analysis. Moreover, many other mathematical disciplines are using the tools and methods of Calculus of Variations. For instance, the space L-infinity is associated to many geometric problems; the community working on Quasiconformal mappings will benefit by having a PDE framework and strong analytical tools in order to optimise the dilation in the sup-norm, an avenue already exploited by the PI in recent work. Another relevant application is the famous problem of optimisation of vectorial Lipschitz extensions. Further, the PDE community, both pure and applied (theory &amp;amp; numerics) will benefit from the core research since the tools and methods of our groundbreaking theory of generalised solutions have wide applicability, including but not being restricted to elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic equations and systems (or of mixed type) of any order and with discontinuous coefficients. Future extensions of the main theory could also include, among others, Stochastic Differential Equations.

Physical, Natural and Earth Sciences: Most physical sciences are using variational models and the resulting equations. This is usually directly related to certain conservation principles (of energy, momentum, mass, etc.) postulated in the relevant context. However, in all cases only the standard integral functionals are typically used, perhaps with some stochastic noise. By developing Calculus of Variations in L-infinity in the vectorial and higher order cases under the proposed project, we will provide these communities with tools, results and most importantly more realistic models that will furnish improved results at the fundamental level of improving the underlying theory, not merely at the level of &amp;quot;buying a bigger computer to speed up simulations&amp;quot;. For example, in Chemistry it is more realistic to know the maximum concentration of a compound before reaction occurs, rather than the average. In Medicine we need to know the maximum safe X-ray absorption level of a tissue, rather that the average. In engineering and aeronautics, it is preferable to know the maximum pressure materials can stand rather than the average. Further, via our concrete Data Assimilation applications in Meteorology, we will provide more precise models regarding the error of weather forecasting, etc.

Industry/Finance/Commercial applications: Most real-world applications of variational models are based on the implementation of computational techniques on some sort of finite-dimensional approximations of the actual model. This mathematical area is usually called Optimisation. The proposed project has the obvious impact on the discretised level as well. Implementation of innovative optimisation models based on the minimisation of a maximum instead of a sum could have potentially huge impact on the improvement of the relevant outputs. The latter may for example include the vector-valued optimisation models (Pareto) used in Finance. These developments, if assimilated and integrated, could be particularly important for the UK. Given the immature nature of the field, our scope for direct interaction with finance has, to date, been limited. In the course of this project we will seek to build such links, although the timescale for the potentially significant impact we envisage, will be long rather than short term.

Wider public: The wider public will be an indirect beneficiary. In the longer run, of the order of some decades, those of the above sectors which will choose to replace their standard variational and optimisation integral models by the appropriate more realistic supremal ones, will definitely provide better and less expensive services.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99078</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have made significant progress in the understanding of generalised solutions (those which potentially have singularities) of fully nonlinear systems of partial differential equations, especially those arising from variational phenomena in the supremum norm.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Fellow researchers will utilise the new mathematical results we have obtained.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>034186A9-BF82-4AB9-85E1-7DCD287275FD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Chemicals,Construction,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/198DF3C9-5A39-40EF-BD6F-C97D733653AC"><gtr:id>198DF3C9-5A39-40EF-BD6F-C97D733653AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Generalised solutions for fully nonlinear PDE systems and existence-uniqueness theorems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Differential Equations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5f2a5b862be8ee17d80fdc561a1e391d"><gtr:id>5f2a5b862be8ee17d80fdc561a1e391d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Katzourakis N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FE89075D-4ED4-4750-9C2B-992A5D2549D3"><gtr:id>FE89075D-4ED4-4750-9C2B-992A5D2549D3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Absolutely minimising generalised solutions to the equations of vectorial calculus of variations in
