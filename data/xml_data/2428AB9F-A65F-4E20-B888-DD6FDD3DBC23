This is particularly important when a person exhibits a facial expression such as anger, which signals hostility or aggression and threatens our physical and emotional welfare. However, facial expressions are fleeting, lasting only between 0.5 and 4 seconds, so it is essential that we clearly and accurately remember who expressed an emotion and where that person is so that we can respond in an appropriate way.

To accurately remember who was where at a particular moment in time, we need to preserve this information in a temporary and short-lived memory store called visuo-spatial working memory. Working memory is an essential component of human life. It is used during every goal-related task, behaviour, and thought, and it enables us to keep track of unfolding events from second to second. Without working memory our daily lives would be chaotic and unmanageable, and it is important to understand how this special kind of memory supports social information processing.

In the current project I will develop a novel experimental task which investigates how threatening (angry) versus non-threatening (happy, sad, fearful) expressions of emotion influence how precisely we can recall the location of faces using visuo-spatial working memory.

Research has shown that angry faces rapidly attract and hold attention better than non-threatening expressions of emotion. There is also evidence that angry expressions improve the accuracy with which we use working memory to recognise a person. However, we currently have a very limited understanding of how facial expressions influence our ability to remember where that person was. Participants will be shown a number of angry and non-threatening faces, and they have to store these faces and their locations in working memory. These 'study' faces will then disappear for a second or so, after which one of them will reappear in a new location but with a neutral expression (now a 'test' face). The disappearance of the initial emotional expression to a neutral pose in the test face thus mirrors the fleeting nature of facial expressions in real life. Using a touch-screen, participants will use their finger to reposition the test face to its original location. The precision with which this response is made will be measured in terms of the distance between the original and recalled locations. Eye movements will also be recorded using an eye-tracking device, in order to examine how much each face is looked at. These eye movement patterns will help determine whether the amount of attention paid to a face and its location relates to how precisely it is subsequently repositioned. 

The presence of an angry expression is predicted to enhance recall precision for who was where. It is also expected that angry faces will require less attention than non-threatening faces in order to remember their location accurately, due to the presence of threat stimulating the brain to process this information more rapidly and efficiently. In some experiments the amount of time participants are required to hold the faces in mind immediately after their disappearance (called the maintenance phase) will be increased. If memory for angry individuals is stronger and more durable over time, it is expected that recall of who was where will remain more precise for angry than non-threatening faces at extended maintenance intervals. 

Humans can vary greatly in their sensitivity and response to social signals. Using questionnaires, levels of social skills and anxiety will be assessed in each individual and compared with their memory performance and eye movement patterns in order to determine whether some people respond differently to social threat than others.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Working memory is central to every goal-related task, behaviour, and thought, and is particularly important during social interaction. The need to interpret social situations correctly and respond appropriately affects us all, and it impacts not only our close relationships with family and friends, but also communications with others in the wider world such as at work, school, university, the local shop, and even the stranger on the street. Individuals who experience difficulties with social communication can be seriously disadvantaged in society and suffer exclusion and distress as a result. Those who are formally diagnosed with a social disorder such as Autism or anxiety can suffer particularly acute problems on a daily basis.

This research has wide applicability to a varied audience. Within the short- and medium term, the proposed research has potential for impact within a wide range of individuals and groups, spanning the general public, social care, clinicians, and key charities such as Research Autism, Scottish Autism, National Autistic Society, and Anxiety UK. Autism is seen as a national priority and is a particular focus of mine. In November 2011, the Scottish Autism Strategy was launched by the Minister for Public Health in order to promote greater synergy between different research fields related to Autism, and to encourage better relationships between research, theory, policy, and practice. In the longer-term, I intend to use the findings from this research with the healthy population to guide and inform future research I will conduct directly with Autistic individuals. In line with the Scottish Autism Strategy, the proposed work therefore has the potential to impact longer-term on policy and practice related to evidence-based care and treatment of Autism.

An additional long-term goal is to use the output from this research with adults as a platform on which to build a more probing investigation of how VSWM for and attention to social threat develops among healthy primary school-aged children and adolescents, and among children and adolescents with Autism. Childhood is a critical period during which social skills are developed, with frequent conflict situations arising in the playground, classroom, home, and in the wider world outside as we endeavour to establish our position within different social hierarchies. This work therefore also provides the potential for future impact on teachers, parents, and other family members who directly care for the more vulnerable groups in society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>208700</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media interest - ESRC project launch - Remembering who was where</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>367835DE-2B88-4EC5-B2AB-E9A317962EF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was a press release to mark the launch of the grant on March 2nd 2015.

Sept 30th 2016. At the stand we demonstrated findings from the ESRC study that measures the impact of emotional expression on remembering who was where. We show that keeping track of person-location information from moment to moment is influenced by whether a person signals reassurance (a smile) versus threat (an angry expression). We displayed a poster and take-away postcards with study information. Members of the public also had the opportunity to try the experiment on a touchscreen for themselves, and were invited to take a selfie showing an emotional expression. Smiley face stickers and hand stamps were provided for children, many of whom visited the stand with their parents/carers also. We collected feedback from a subset of visitors using five face expression symbols ranging from very negative to very positive: 95% of respondents thought it was very enjoyable or interesting , and the other 5% found it quite enjoyable/interesting. On a scale of 1-7 where 0=None and 7=A Lot, 86% of respondents rated 5 or higher for how much they felt they learnt new things (62% rated 6 or 7). Many members of the public engaged in interesting discussion on the importance of visuospatial working memory during social interaction and networking, and the kinds of messages different facial expressions of emotion convey. A twitter # was created (#placethatfaceAbdn) to which we uploaded pictures and updates of the event. Across all tweets to this hashtag, we obtained 1734 impressions and 102 engagements in total. #Explorathon16 was also used.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation, ECVP2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76221D61-D0BA-4716-8E03-3E5F15222457</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Sara Spotorno and Dr Jackson presented a poster at the European Conference on Visual Perception in Barcelona in September 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Shmu FM radio interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B682D22-8F31-4D28-B602-CF5CAE16071E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a 20 minute radio interview about my research in general and about the ESRC project in particular (11th August 2015).

People also shared their own opinions on how emotions can influence their thinking, both in terms of other people's expressions and also in how our own mood state can colour this. The session was held by the PI (Dr Margaret Jackson) and the new post-doc, Dr Marlene Poncet.

This new research measures working memory for both who (visual) and where (spatial) using a novel face relocation paradigm. When binding of who and where is required, happy faces are more accurately relocated than angry faces. Further data shows that the duration of time in which faces have to be held in working memory modulates this - memory for happy faces is more durable over longer periods of time than memory for angry faces. Eyetracking data also shows that the order in which the faces were attended influences memory accuracy. This advantage for relocating happy faces is a novel finding and is an interesting contrast to the threat advantage found when purely visual memory is assessed.

Much of this data is still undergoing analysis, and individual differences in social anxiety, autistic traits, and mood are also being investigated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The data analysis is not complete yet so I cannot be clear on all aspects of impact a this stage. Individual differences are an important aspect that are still being assessed (they require large sample sizes). The programming, data extraction and preparation, and analyses are time consuming, but everything is on schedule. Data has already been presented at the European Society for Cognitive Psychology (ESCoP, Sept 2015). Further data will be presented at two conferences in 2016 (Consortium of European Research on Emotion; CERE, July) and European Conference on Visual Perception (ECVP, August). In addition, the PI will attend a special meeting on Working Memory in North Yorkshire (Percival Hall) where she will share and discuss some key findings with eminent working memory experts in a small and intimate context. The next ESRC Festival of Social Sciences is scheduled for November 2016 and we aim to promote and demonstrate the work and findings there to the public. Work has started on the first paper for publication, and several papers are expected to emerge from across studies once data analysis is complete.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2831AC1F-C4B5-46FB-92B2-2646E843250D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L008912/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
