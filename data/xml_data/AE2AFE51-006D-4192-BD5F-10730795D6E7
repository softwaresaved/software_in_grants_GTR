Against a background of the operation of precedent within the common law the project examines exactly how and why particular reported cases become significant in the sense that they are cited more frequently than others and come to represent or define the legal position in a particular area of practice or doctrine. Taking the dynamic area of judicial review, the research will identify some twenty to forty &amp;quot;important cases&amp;quot; and create a typology highlighting elements which contribute to a case&amp;nbsp; being regarded by various groups as important. This will be tested through interview and focus group to develop an understanding not only of how a case becomes &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; but also how an individual case is transmitted across the various practice communities / communities of interest, and how it becomes validated as useful legal knowledge. Moving from specialist to more general application in practice, and reflecting on how such information interacts with, and is mediated by, academic scholarship, the research will develop important knowledge about how legal argumentation is actually constructed and valued by different legal communities.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>52810</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What Makes an Important Case?

This talk provoked interest from a range of legal information professionals about how law is accessed and used. These ranged from University librarians to information specialists working in legal practice.

This engagement not only provided an opportunity to make contacts for further interviews and fieldwork as well as fine-tuning the project schedule and direction, but also provided an opportunity for some interchange about the interim findings and their direct value to the legal professions.

Increased contacts to develop the research in an iterative way as well as an opportunity to engage with beneficiaries on the interim findings.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Citizen and the State in the Digital Age: Law and Legal Information</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA503962-B71D-48AB-9510-AE2A88D0E9E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented to international audience under the auspices of IACL (the International Association of Constitutional Law).

One element of this work has been to engage with a number of bloggers and authors of updating services, as well as the authors of law reports (Incorporated Council of Law Reporting) and the British and Irish Legal Information Institute. Our findings about what makes an important case have been of value to a number of such sources and assisted in the development of new approaches to online resources.
The project also engaged closely with law librarians via the British and Irish Association of Law Librarians, and others to help inform developing ideas about the future of legal information. For example, in our own law school the approach to providing multiple copies of bound law reports has been transformed and education and training about legal research techniques has focused instead on ideas of &amp;quot;important cases&amp;quot; and how to access these. 
On the final completion of our main research output - the major, agenda changing article - we propose to develop further all these engagements and impacts through dialogue with appropriate stakeholders.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FF2D7613-869A-439B-B8ED-071EAB8D2F3B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research found that for those in legal practice there is an exponentially expanding reservoir of legal authority which must be sorted through and the &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot; authority produced. It is vital for practitioners to know what amounts to an &amp;quot;important case&amp;quot; and will therefore &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; for their cause. Those providing legal advice require a degree of certainty that comes from there being a settled understanding of the legal position in any area. In court an advocate needs to be able to engage with the other side, and with the judge, and process his or her argument. In part it will come down to what the advocates believe will be seen as relevant to the judge but here too there is a rich and complex social process occurring. For the judge, who by and large can only consider only the authorities that are put to the court, there is the question of which authorities are relevant. This is by no means an automatic process where settled understandings are brought to bear. The judge does not simply consider &amp;quot;the facts&amp;quot; and select the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; authority to determine the issue in the same way as someone doing a jigsaw puzzle finds the piece that fits. Neither fact nor law exists in this reified sense. Both are created and conditioned from a complex social milieu. The creation of an &amp;quot;important case&amp;quot; is a central element of this complex process. Taking the specialist area of judicial review the project developed an idea of what it is that makes a particular decision of significance such that it will become widely cited and used within the legal community as an &amp;quot;important case&amp;quot;. The research initially explored the way in which cases come to be reported and noted a wider sociological process at work in how decisions come to be noticed, written up and disseminated through both formal and informal networks. The role of new technology in the form of feeds, blogs and webpages does have some influence in how legal precedents are created and consumed but traditional channels remain central. Interviewing a range of practitioners who can be seen as operating within concentric circles of expertise, the researchers explored those factors which contribute to a case being recognised as of particular value. Those interviewees drawn from specialist textbook writers, leading counsel and specialist judges emphasized the significance of cases that opened up new areas of law or procedure, while this group and those less specialist counsel, solicitors and government lawyers, confirmed the value of precedents which consolidated the legal position in a methodical way. Decisions that had particular political or social significance were not by themselves seen as important to our interviewees. The research sought also to explain how legal knowledge is transmitted within the system and across various degrees of specialism. It tested a hypothesis that sees important cases as being created by an elite group of specialist judicial review practitioners and judges who are regularly involved in the Administrative Court and appellate courts in judicial review practice. The knowledge created there is then collected and passed onwards and outwards to practitioner and academic writers, and others, who make judgments about what is important. This information is then disseminated further to wider communities of practice where lawyers with a more general orientation actually use the cases in everyday practice and complete the loop. The researchers are presently completing a major article to be submitted to a leading law journal which will detail the findings of the research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8022C72B-540D-4FBB-B312-1DC1E3D4B49D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4B832548-6DDC-4648-A80C-A88F173268EE"><gtr:id>4B832548-6DDC-4648-A80C-A88F173268EE</gtr:id><gtr:title>What Makes An Important Case?
