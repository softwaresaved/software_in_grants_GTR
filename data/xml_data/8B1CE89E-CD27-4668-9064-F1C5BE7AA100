&amp;quot;The Audit Commission has lost its way. Rather than being a watchdog that champions taxpayers' interests, it has become the creature of the Whitehall state. We need to redress this balance.&amp;quot; 

Since its creation in 1983 the Audit Commission has appointed auditors, regulated fees and monitored audit quality for public sector organisations such as Local Authorities and National Health Service Trusts whose annual expenditure amounts to &amp;pound;200bn. By April 2017 the Audit Commission will be abolished and the auditing of local public sector organisations will be subject to a new audit regime in which local bodies appoint their own auditors and the monitoring of quality is performed by the Financial Reporting Council. A key aim of these reforms, in a time of austerity, is lower costs. In response, the Commission's 2011 audit tendering process has already secured large fee reductions for the period up to 2017. Unsurprisingly, there are fears for audit quality and for rises in fees when the new regime comes into effect.

This project, which comprises three studies focused on the costs and quality of public sector audit, is motivated by the issues raised by these reforms and will build on my prior research in public sector audit, my experience as an NHS non-executive director and my training as an auditor. It will also act as a springboard for a collaborative public sector accounting research centre.

STUDY 1 aims to estimate the effect of the new audit regime, which is similar to that for NHS Foundation Trusts, on audit fees and audit quality. This study will inform the current debate on the likely effect of the new regime, which is largely unsupported by research evidence.

STUDY 2 looks to the potential for savings in audit fees which are within the control of local management. Study 2 will utilise a unique dta set, represented by the pre-audit financial statements of English local authorities, to investigate the relationship between pre-audit financial reporting quality and audit fees. It will provide a basis for estimating potential audit fee savings from improvements in pre-audit financial reporting quality. 

STUDY 3 investigates, in the previously unexplored setting of local authorities, the relationship between audit quality, auditor type, (Big4, Audit Commission and other) and audit fees over a period of considerable pressure on fees. A distinctive feature of this study will be the construction of novel measures of audit quality which exploit the availability of pre-audit financial statements. The findings could presage a rise in fees or an increase in market concentration once the current audit contracts come to an end. Further, variations in financial reporting quality by auditor may influence future auditor appointments. 

In addition to informing policy and practice in England these studies have policy relevance for the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies and the Scottish Parliament, none of which is following the English lead, and for wider international audiences in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada where public sector audit has historically followed a similar model to that in the UK. 

The integration of stakeholder input into the design of each study, the interpretation of findings and their subsequent dissemination will be secured through the establishment of a stakeholder co-production group. The contribution of this group will be central to delivering high quality academic papers and research findings with practice and policy impact. The project overall will act as a springboard for the establishment of a collaborative regional centre for public sector accounting research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>NON-ACADEMIC BENEFICIARIES of this project include:

POLICY MAKERS. 
The findings of this project will provide evidence which could influence the way that the (currently draft) legislation is implemented. The National Audit Office and Financial Reporting Council for example may be interested in findings of relevance to the monitoring of audit quality. The findings could also be of value to the post-implementation review of the new audit regime (Department of Communities and Local Government, 2013, p.17).
Internationally the findings will be of interest to countries, such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand which have adopted similar programmes of public sector reform as in the UK. The findings of greater effectiveness through lower costs whilst maintaining quality has the potential to initiate policy debates about the operation and regulation of their own public audit systems.

REGULATORS: The findings from this project will provide evidence which
- Can be used to inform any future inquiry into the effectiveness of the new public sector audit regime by the Public Accounts Committee or by other Parliamentary Select Committees.
- May be used as a basis for supporting measures which mitigate the consequences of the new regime for smaller bodies.
- May suggest the desirability of measures aimed at maintaining a diverse range of audit firms competing in the public sector audit market.
- In a time of pressure on fees may suggest the desirability of additional controls over audit quality.

REPRESENTATIVE BODIES 
This project will allow representative bodies to support and represent their member organisations more effectively by providing evidence which can inform any future debate about the efficiency and effectiveness of public audit. Such bodies include auditee representative bodies, such as the Local Government Association, the NHS Confederation, the Foundation Trust Governors Association, and auditor representative bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (all audit firms appointed to audit public bodies are member firms of this Institute). 

INDIVIDUAL COUNCILS AND NHS BODIES, AND THEIR AUDIT COMMITTEES
The findings from this study will serve to enhance the efficiency of auditor-auditee contracting by alerting Councils and NHS Bodies to the following:
- the potential savings from the enhancement of pre-audit financial reporting quality.
- the potential desirability of co-operation to increase the purchasing power of local bodies in auditor appointment and fee negotiation.
- the relationship between audit fees and audit quality
- differences in audit quality by auditor type.

TAXPAYERS and their representatives, such as members of Parliament and lobbying groups such as the TAXPAYERS ALLIANCE.
The project will allow taxpayers interests to be protected more effectively by providing useful research evidence on the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector audit.

AUDIT FIRMS:
Audit firms may benefit reputationally from participation in this project by demonstrating their commitment to the delivery of value for money in public audit services. Further, if the findings indicate that audit services are more effective following the Audit Commission's abolition, the debate about extending this model to other regions of the UK, and perhaps internationally, would be opened up. Alternatively, evidence from this project could inform audit firms of potential issues relating to their service efficiency and effectiveness. This would facilitate appropriate action before such issues become a matter of public concern.

USERS OF PUBLIC SERVICES
The users of public services will benefit from this project through additional confidence in the financial statements of public organisations. Users want an effective audit service so that financial problems can be identified at an early stage before the emergence of threats to service quality and future service delivery.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>246805</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Feature article in 'The Conversation'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3623C0C1-0B27-424C-9E1D-6AB65374F0C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was no observable consequences of this activity but it would have served to raise awareness of both the topic, which is generally 'inaccessible' to the public, its significance in terms of the management of public spending and of the significance of the research in extending our understanding of public sector financial statements.
