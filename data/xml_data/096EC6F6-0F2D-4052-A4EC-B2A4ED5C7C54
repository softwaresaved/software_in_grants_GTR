&lt;p>A key tenet of many academic theories and social policies is that schools play a key role in socialising future citizens into their roles in civic and political communities. Yet the role of the state in citizenship, education, and cohesion is being transformed as the myriad implications of globalisation, decentralisation, and migration take effect.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project therefore seeks to re-examine these long held assumptions and to re-assess the extent to which school policies and practices still have an impact on civic and political socialisation. Some of the questions that will be addressed include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Do countries with more centralised state school systems have higher levels of cohesion and civic engagement than countries which have more independent schools?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Does placing more emphasis on national identity in education help to create a stronger sense of belonging and civic commitment?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Does citizenship education increase support for democracy or a greater willingness to participate?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This project will examine these questions from an inter-disciplinary and quantitative perspective, and using data from the 2009 ICCS study.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of this study will be of interest to policymakers, practitioners and civil society organisations who work with children, young people, educational issues, and/ or on citizenship and cohesion. 

IMPACT ON THE POLICY COMMUNITY 
In terms of policymakers in the UK, the findings of this study will be of relevance for the Cabinet Office in their efforts to implement the Big Society Initiative and the Department for Education, who are responsible for the National Citizens Service and the National Curriculum review. For example, the findings from this project could provide evidence about the relative merits of different types of citizenship education, and thus contribute to debates about whether Citizenship should remain a statutory part of the secondary curriculum in England.

In the European context, the results will be of interest to officials in the European Commission and the Council of Europe (CoE). Both the EU and the CoE have an ongoing commitment to promoting learning for active citizenship and social cohesion. This project could contribute to these policy debates by helping to explain some of the similarities and differences in citizenship and cohesion outcomes across Europe. In addition, this study could also provide evidence about whether learning for active citizenship does, as their policy initiatives presuppose, lead to higher levels of support for democracy among young citizens and stronger intentions to participate in civic and political activities in the future.

IMPACT ON CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS
The results of this study are most likely to interest civil society organisations who focus on citizenship and cohesion issues. These include the Citizenship Foundation, the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), the Schools Linking Network (SLN) in the UK, and the European Wergeland Centre (EWC) in Europe. 

This study could provide an evidence-base to support the work that they are doing with policy-makers, schools, and communities. For example, this evidence could be used to inform their policies, to support their applications for funding, and/ or to buttress their efforts to influence local or national government policy decisions. In addition, the knowledge exchange proposals that this project includes could help to raise awareness of designing and using research effectively. 

To give a concrete example, one of the questions that this study will examine is whether schools with an intercultural ethos lead to students having higher levels of tolerance and social trust. Findings from this analysis will be of interest and benefit to organisations which promote intercultural understanding through education, such as the SLN and the Pears Foundation. If an intercultural ethos does have a positive effect on tolerance and social trust, the study could also help to identify the factors that interact with intercultural ethos and can help or hinder its effects on citizenship and cohesion outcomes. 

IMPACT ON PRACTITIONERS IN SCHOOLS
Finally, the findings of this project could also benefit practitioners in schools, particularly teachers of citizenship education. 

On a general level, the results of this study could help educational professionals in understanding their changing role in the community and society as a whole. More concretely, it could help school leaders to understand how different policies result in different outcomes, and to assess the relative merits of different models of providing citizenship and cohesion learning (such as discrete lessons versus service learning or cross-curricular learning). A greater understanding of these issues could help professionals decide how to overcome the obstacles they face and maximise their potential impact on young citizens' attitudes, behaviours, knowledge, and skills.

To this end, I have completed several research publications and found that: 

a) Learning about Europe at school is associated with higher levels of European identity among students and higher levels of support for freedom of movement and equal rights for EU migrants. Learning a foreign language has a similarly positive relationship (see Keating, 2014, Education for citizenship in Europe; and Keating, 2015, Are cosmopolitan dispositions learned at home, at school, or through contact with others?). 

b) In comparison, school activities that promote inter-cultural contact (such as school exchanges) have a comparatively weak effect (perhaps because of the short-term nature of these activities). However, schools may be able to help boost and spread the potential impact by helping students from low income families to participate (and thereby benefit from) these types of experiences (see Keating, 2015, Are cosmopolitan dispositions learned at home, at school, or through contact with others?). 

c) School-based activities such as school councils, mock elections and debating teams can have a positive and lasting impact on political engagement among young people in England (see Keating and Janmaat, 2015). 
 
d) Schools can still play an important role in youth civic socialisation, but their role is comparatively small, and they should not be seen as a panacea for political or social problems (see Keating, 2014, 2016).

e) Many young people in Britain are using social media to engage with politics, but young people only do so if they are already interested in politics. Social media is not engaging or mobilising 'new' disenfranchised groups (Keating and Melis, under review).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings that are available thus far will be of interest to NGOs, advocacy groups, and policymakers that are interested in protecting the place of Citizenship in the English curriculum or evaluating the European dimension to national curricula.
