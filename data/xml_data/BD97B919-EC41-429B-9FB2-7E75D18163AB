The chosen objective is to design, build and run a Mach 1.4 (1000mph) world land speed record car. Since the public launch in October 2008 it has become clear that the project is highly attractive to companies, public and education with 5091 educational establishments signed to the project including 45 universities.

The car is currently under construction and following UK trials will be operational on the special South African Hakskeen Pan desert in 2013 and 2014. The target is an 800mph performance in 2013 a new World record, then 1000mph runs in 2014. Achieving these ambitious, but possible, objectives the project requires a step increase in capacity in the core engineering team to undertake the final stage of the development, manufacture, commissioning, testing and running of the car. 

In addition to this engineering work it is vital to expand the current educational engagement activities which are coordinated and managed by BET (Bloodhound Educational Team), BET has two divided activities into two segments:
Bloodhound Educational Team (BET) which handles public engagement, schools, colleges and international education.
Bloodhound@University- the HE component which led and managed by UWE. 

BET Scope &amp;amp; Activities- 
1)Continuation of the Schools evangelism process to raise awareness and engagement with STEM/Bloodhound
2)Expand and consolidate Ambassador activities ; communication and organisation of Bloodhound Ambassador network
3)Development of VLE to support public and educational engagement.
4)Public Engagement activities to promote STEM subjects. 
5)Commissioning of Educational Resources for use across education-Primary to HE.
6)Establish a robust, secure and adaptable repository for data produced through the project as it develops tests, manufactures and runs the car. This is a crucial activity to ensure that Bloodhound leaves an educational legacy that can be accessed and used in the future.
7)Undertake evaluation and audit of Bloodhound's educational activities to inform future thinking and projects aimed at raising STEM engagement.

The Bloodhound@Univrersity HE activities there are three key objectives for the next phase of the HE activities to support Bloodhound.
1)Establish a secure and structured data repository (K-Box) that will both support the Engineering team and also enable future access, usage of data and information from the project for education.
2)Establish a framework and processes that enable academics to access data to develop teaching objects - lecture notes, case studies, project briefs etc.
3)Build on the current Special Interest Group which has regular engagement with 20 universities and increase engagement with the Bloodhound data repository-K-Box.

The establishment of a structured repository for the Bloodhound Project is a key and essential task. A suitable system will both support the on-going operation of the Engineering Design Team and also ensure that the unique open access to data and information from the project is captured in a form that will make it accessible in the future. Creating a reliable, structured and secure repository though is not sufficient in itself to ensure the legacy from Bloodhound is of benefit to the educational community across the UK. A secure and reliable repository with little or no interaction with the target user communities serves little purpose. Therefore a crucial objective is to stimulate engagement and use of the data and information by the UK education community, at all levels - primary to university. This will enable the project to realise its declared objective to provide unique and unprecedented access to real details and data on the car, its design and running.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Bloodhound Educational Programme - across the spectrum from Primary to HE is estimated to have the following impact -
 Schools - already over 5,000 Schools have engaged with the project. This number is targeted to increase with an objective of achieving a Bloodhound Presence in 6,000 schools by the end of the project. This represents a significant educational and public engagement/awareness impact - the total number of children impacted is clearly difficult to access due to the marked variation in headcount.
 University - To date some 40 UK HEI's have engaged with the Bloodhound@University activities. The provision of seed-corn funding to stimulate greater engagement and production of exemplar teaching materials will strengthen existing links and widen participation to other HEI's who have not collaborated thus far. It is expected that the current list of participants will increase to reach 50% of UK HE institutions thus the support provided for content development 
The educational impact will have two dimensions - learners and teachers/academics. The learners will be impacted by exposure to the technological/science/maths aspects of Bloodhound but also will be introduced to the wider STEM agenda. The Open access approach of the project will impact teachers and academics by providing unparalleled access to the design, development and related data from the project. The impact of the establishment of the K-Box open access resource will provide educators with a free to use and access source of teaching material unlike any that exists to date.
Public - The public speaking/direct engagement events and BloodhoundSSC presence at other STEM and related events will contribute to a general public awareness raising of the specifics of this project and also the wider STEM agenda.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2000000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K025775/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
