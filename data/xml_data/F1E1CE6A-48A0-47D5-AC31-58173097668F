They have resulted in a substantial increase of knowledge about quantum fluids and have addressed questions that have been pondered for decades. Their applicability to a better understanding of real materials will facilitate the controllable design of new functional materials in the future.
Up to now most of this research has focused on equilibrium systems; however quantum gases are perhaps even better suited to studying non-equilibrium phenomena. In particular, they have the following advantages: (i) Hamiltonian parameters can be controlled in real time by external means, such as laser light or magnetic fields; (ii) near perfect isolation from the environment makes them ideal for studying intrinsic quantum dynamics; (iii) the relevant timescales are generally favourable (millisecond scale) for time resolved studies. These unique features allow for experimentally realizing quantum quench experiments , during which Hamiltonian parameters, such as the interaction strength, are changed either effectively instantaneously (&amp;quot;instantaneous quench&amp;quot;) or slowly (&amp;quot;slow quench&amp;quot;). This leaves the system in a state that is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian and which subsequently time-evolves and relaxes into a new (possibly stationary) state through many-body quantum interference effects. 
Quantum quench experiments are the cornerstones of the scientific understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena because they are conceptually very clean and, in the case of an instantaneous quench, best describable theoretically (even though usually still unsolvable). Consider, for example, an isolated many-body quantum system quenched through a phase transition - there are many questions that are still far from being answered: What determines whether the quantum system will equilibrate? How does the quantum system equilibrate? Does equilibration always lead to thermalisation? What are the roles of temperature and energy gaps in the spectrum? How do different processes like density ordering and the establishment of off-diagonal long-range order compete? 
Of course, formally the unitary time evolution of an isolated quantum mechanical state is known. However, strong interactions and/or long evolution times make the problem theoretically intractable. Additionally, the presence of dissipation complicates matters and even for weak dissipation only very few special cases, such as Markovian dissipation or harmonic oscillator baths, have been thoroughly studied. For crossing a classical phase transitions into an ordered phase, the dynamics of defect formation has been predicted to obey universal behaviour according to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism but the applicability of the mechanism to quantum systems is highly debated. Therefore, answering the above, fairly generic, questions using well-controlled model systems of ultracold atoms will provide crucial benchmarks for establishing possibly general laws of equilibration and thermalisation, which has been considered one of the Grand Challenges of Physics. 
In our experiments, we will investigate Bose gases quenched through the BEC phase transition as well as Fermi gases quenched into pseudogap or superfluid phases. For the bosonic part, the establishment of off-diagonal long-range order after a quench will be the prime focus in order to establish a firm and general physical picture of this process. In the Fermi case we will explore the relation between local (pair formation) and global (off-diagonal long-range) order. In the limit of preformed local pairs (molecules) we will be in a unique position to directly compare the results with our own measurements with Bose gases. This will then provide an excellent benchmark for gradually moving (by tuning the interactions) towards the more convolved limit of non-local Cooper pairs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. People
Our researchers will receive excellent training in both specialist and general transferable skills and this grant will significantly strengthen UK's presence and competitiveness in the still growing field of ultracold atomic gases. In addition to its intrinsic academic value, this field has a strong potential to attract highly-skilled researchers. The postdoctoral fellows (and the students) will be trained in state-of-the-art experimental techniques. These specialist skills will be indispensable for future jobs in academia or high-tech industries. Excellent training courses in professional and transferable skills are offered by the Department and the University at Cambridge. Topics include planning, project management, creativity in research, communication, presentation/writing skills, research consultancy, assertiveness, innovation, enterprise skills, and team work. We will help our researchers to identify the relevant courses for their needs and interests. 

2. Generation of knowledge
Quantum simulation of complex problems of condensed matter physics with ultracold atoms is currently developing into an intensely studied research field. The goal of this fusion between atomic and condensed matter physics is to push forward the fundamental understanding of technologically relevant quantum materials. Quantum correlations and strong interactions trigger the occurrence of new phases of matter which may find their way into applications in our daily life, for example in medical instrumentation. Besides the scientific interest in the fundamental understanding of matter, the ability to engineer, control and exploit such quantum phenomena is one of the greatest challenges of physics in the 21st century.

3. Cross-pollinating scientific communities
Our research lies at the interface between atomic physics, quantum engineering, and condensed matter physics. In the UK, the ties between these communities have intensified over the past years, in particular in view of non-equilibrium complex systems and simulations of complex materials using quantum gases. We are well connected with the UK quantum gas community. MK &amp;amp; ZH are members of the EPSRC-funded network UKCAN for research at the interface of cold atom physics and condensed matter physics, coordinated by Mark Fromhold (Nottingham). This project will strengthen relations with key groups in the UK working in diverse fields of research, in particular in theory (including J. Cardy, J. Chalker, V. Cheianov, N. Cooper, F. Essler, D. Gangardt, D. Jaksch, J. Ruostekoski) and experiments (including K. Bongs, C. Foot, P. Kr&amp;uuml;ger, S. Kuhr) of strongly correlated quantum gases out of equilibrium.

4. Technology
The instruments we will build during the grant and the methods we will develop almost certainly will have potential for a successful commercialisation. However, the realistic scale of a potential commercialisation is very difficult to assess in advance for a fundamental research programme - it could range from advanced lab tools to fully operational quantum simulators. The group of MK has a very strong record of successful commercialisation of instruments. For example, a former and a current PhD student of MK's group run an enterprise, which has specialised in manufacturing precision equipment for laser spectroscopy. These components, originally developed for solving specific research tasks in the lab, are now sold and distributed worldwide to academic and industrial customers. This directly results in economic benefits arising from fundamental research.

5. Economy and Society
While our research is primarily fundamental, one can envision several ways in which our work could have impact on practical applications in the long run and economic benefits even in the short term: (1) Future information technologies, (2) More efficient quantum devices, (3) Attraction of international funding.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>766426</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This research is primarily blue sky, but thanks to its outcomes we have attracted significant funding into the UK, in particular through a prestigious ERC grant (worth about &amp;pound;1.5M) and also from the US Army.

The outcomes of this research have also already had impact on education - our findings have already been incorporated into the new edition of the main textbook in our field, and have also been used in exams for high school teachers in Germany.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5D485267-8A74-4438-B533-0B9C8CF16EE1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Under this grant we investigated the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems, using ultracold atomic gases. Understanding the non-equilibrium behaviour of quantum systems is both an outstanding fundamental problem and also increasingly an issue of potential practical importance, since quantum mechanics plays an increasing role in applications such as modern electronics and computer technology, and moreover we are entering an era where new devices based specifically on quantum technologies are starting to emerge. 

Regarding equilibrium phase transitions, we have experimentally mapped out the transition temperature to a superfluid state as a function of the interaction strength in a two-dimensional harmonically trapped Bose gas. This work provided experimental evidence for a theoretical picture that unifies the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics of superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation in this system. 

Using both Bose and Fermi atomic gases we have performed a series of studies that have led to 8 high profile publications, including a Science, 2 Nature Physics and 3 Physical Review Letters. These results were also featured in popular press such as Physics Today and have led to many invitations to the most prestigious international conferences, including the International Conference on Atomic Physics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work has already led to numerous further studies and theoretical proposals for better understanding of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with the papers associated with this grant being cited over 100 times already before the grant ended.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>09F7AAEB-7C0B-4994-9A00-72F8739F721B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Electronics,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www-amop.phy.cam.ac.uk/amop-zh/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/79A09538-8D02-4D05-BBB1-B5EFEA60B209"><gtr:id>79A09538-8D02-4D05-BBB1-B5EFEA60B209</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantum Joule-Thomson effect in a saturated homogeneous Bose gas.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/80e54bc92b7c821f6805025b2cd20c6b"><gtr:id>80e54bc92b7c821f6805025b2cd20c6b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schmidutz TF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BCB30119-AD0B-4910-9080-3D0BE57824B3"><gtr:id>BCB30119-AD0B-4910-9080-3D0BE57824B3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantum gases.
