The movement of these DNA segments around genomes is orchestrated by a transposase protein encoded in the transposon itself. This enzyme cuts the DNA out of its original location and pastes it into a new site. This cut-and-paste property is being exploited to develop biotechnology tools for scientific research and medical applications. Learning more about how transposases move DNA will enable scientists to understand how to better control these enzymes and thereby speed the development of transposon tools. The mariner/Tc1 family of transposons is particularly widespread, being found in insects, plants, and animals including humans, and there is evidence that they can move from one host species to another over evolutionary time. This family is unusual in that all the elements are pasted into specific, but very short sequences of DNA comprising just two DNA bases. This proposal is aimed at discovering how transposases from this family choose this sequence and how they insert the transposon DNA into their target. To do this we will obtain a molecular snapshot of the Mos1 transposase in action at the DNA integration step of the transposition process. This will involve solving an X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme bound to both transposon DNA and target DNA. We have already solved structures of the enzyme and transposon DNA at earlier stages in the transposition process. The results of biochemical experiments will support and validate our findings. Having gained this detailed molecular understanding of the transposition machinery, we propose to engineer the transposase so that it can be directed to insert transposon DNA precisely where it is required. The ability to control the enzyme, based on a thorough knowledge of its three-dimensional structure as well as its chemical mechanism, should be of enormous benefit to developing gene therapy applications of this family of transposons, where precise control will be essential.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>DNA transposons are segments of DNA than can move from one location to another in their host's genome. In doing so, they generate genetic diversity and contribute to genomic instability and evolution. The ability of transposons to integrate into genomes is being exploited to develop new tools for gene delivery in a diverse range of biotechnology applications. Mariner/Tc1 family transposons are surprisingly widespread and active in a range of species including vertebrates. They move by a cut-and-paste mechanism that is distinct from other transposons. They are also unusual in that DNA integration occurs into a specific di-nucleotide (TA), rather than a broad consensus sequence of specific length. Previously I determined crystal structures of Mos1 transposase complexes and established the structural and molecular basis for Mos1 excision. Now we aim to understand how Mos1 transposase recognizes the target DNA sequence and how it coordinates integration of transposon DNA. To do this we will determine X-ray crystal structures of Mos1 target capture complexes prior to and after strand transfer. Biochemical experiments using mutant transposases or base analogs will provide additional insight into the DNA integration mechanism, and will support and validate the structural findings. We will also establish if there is a general mechanism for target DNA recognition in this family, by also studying other mariner/Tc1 transposases. Finally, using our detailed knowledge of Mos1 integration, we will adopt a structure based approach to engineer the transposase so that it integrates at pre-selected DNA sequences. To do this we will insert specific DNA-binding domains into the transposase, in loop regions predicted to be close to target DNA, and test the targeting efficiency in an in vitro targeted transposition assay. The ability to control the enzyme in this way will facilitate the development of targeted gene delivery applications of this family of transposases.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project focuses on understanding a fundamental biological process, transposon DNA integration, however the research will have downstream impacts on a number of beneficiaries out with the immediate academic scientific environment. For example: Current users of transposon technologies benefit from past research into transposon biology which led to the availability of these tools. These users will continue to benefit from the development of improved gene delivery tools and new applications of these technologies that could arise from a detailed understanding of transposition mechanisms. For example, increased control of target DNA integration will be essential for safe implementation of gene therapy applications of transposases. Some users are applying transposon technologies to relevant medical problems that will, in the long term, provide health benefits to the general public. One notable recent example is the use of the piggyBac transposon gene delivery system to reprogram human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells. These cells share the promise of embryonic stem cells to transform regenerative medicine, whilst circumventing ethical issues. Pharmaceutical companies who are developing anti-retroviral therapeutics to inhibit the viral-genome integration step of HIV-1 infection will benefit indirectly from research on the mechanistically related process of transposon DNA integration. The active site that catalyses DNA integration is highly conserved between retroviral integrases and mariner/Tc1 transposases. Current retroviral therapies (e.g. raltegravir) target this active site and inhibit integration by binding to the two metal ions required for catalysis. Structural insights into transposase DNA integration will therefore indirectly benefit those seeking to understand developing resistance to current anti-retroviral drugs and to design second generation inhibitors. The PDRA working on the project will benefit by developing professional skills beyond the technical scientific skills required to deliver the research objectives. These will include presentation and writing skills, organizational skills, management skills (through supervising Hons project students and Masters project students) and networking skills (through attending conferences). These skills will be attractive to many different employment sectors, including academia, business and commerce, teaching and journalism.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313687</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Edinburgh</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Chemistry Edinburgh</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration in Molecular Photophysics</gtr:description><gtr:id>E26BEC4C-0AC4-47E6-85E5-C15602963DEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A manuscript has been written and, at this stage, has been submitted to a journal for review</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Experimental expertise, intellectual expertise in photophysics (analysis of data, writing manuscript)

We have met our key objective by solving the crystal structure of the strand transfer complex (after transposon integration). It reveals a bend, flip and trap mechanism for transposon integration. We have confirmed the novel base-flipping of target bases by fluorescence spectroscopy (in a very productive new collaboration with Prof A Jones in Chemistry at University of Edinburgh). Specific recognition of the flipped target adenine bases provides a molecular mechanism for TA target site selection. Our structural and biochemical results provide a framework for designing mariner/Tc1 transposases with modified target specificities. 
The DNA integration assay developed in the course of this work has been applied in two other projects. One of these revealed that the anti-retroviral drug Raltegravir can inhibit Mos1 transposase, but the related second-generation drug Elvitegravir cannot.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The grant finished in Spring 2015 and the key paper describing our results was published in eLife in May 2016. Our results will facilitate engineering of the transposase (and closely related enzymes) to alter the DNA sequences into which mariner DNA transposons can be integrated. Targeted transposases or conversely non-specific transposases could broaden the biotechnology applications of DNA transposition.
