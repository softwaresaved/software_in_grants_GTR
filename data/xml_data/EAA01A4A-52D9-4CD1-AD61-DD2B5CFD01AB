The extent to which the Black and Asian actors who initiated these political and social debates influenced new artistic practices and forms in the city is not yet understood. \n\nThis project will recover the lives of Black and Asian men and women who worked as artists and artists' models in London between 1919 and 1939 and seeks to understand the role they played in the changing artistic, social, cultural and political scenes that emerged in interwar London. Examining the archives of art collections as well as personal papers, autobiographies and memoirs, it will reconstruct the historical geographies of these men and women, their friends, colleagues, and the spaces they inhabited. These places included social meeting places in Soho such as the Florence Mills club and social and political clubs such as the socialist International Club in Shoreditch.\n\nIn particular the project will ask:\n\n1. What was the relationship between artists who depicted cosmopolitan life in their art and Black and Asian activists who were living and working in the city?\n\n2. What were the life experiences of Black and Asian sitters? How did the personal relationships between artists and sitters influence these experiences?\n\n3. To what extent were activists influenced by artists in the formation and expression of their political ideas? \n\n4. How have Black and Asian artists and sitters been remembered and forgotten in public memory and art historiography?\n\nWe will produce a number of outputs from the research. In addition to academic papers, two exhibition displays using material from the research will be held. A database of the material recovered will be made available via the UCL Equiano Centre website, and images (where available) provided with contextual information with an online gallery. In addition an online map with the location of people and places (such as art schools and studios, clubs and private homes) will be mapped and annotated as a walk. This will be available to download from the website and will also be given as a guided walk to those who are unable to attend the guided walks in London. \n\nBy advancing the understanding of the relationship between art and cosmopolitan identities between the Wars, the outcomes of this research will be of interest to a range of audiences including academics, curators, heritage practitioners and community scholars researching the Black and Asian presence in Britain.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic research community a number of public communities and public sector bodies will benefit from the research, primarily: Community Scholars, art galleries and archives and their visitors, sixth form students and their teachers, and local communities and members of the general interested in the diverse histories of London. \n\nThese audiences will benefit from a range of targeted research outputs:\n\n1 Research publications\n2 A database freely available for non-commercial research\n3 An Online exhibition with annotated materials\n4 Object based teaching material \n5 Exhibitions and a walking tour \n\nThe outputs of the project will make an important contribution to scholarship on the black presence in Britain, work which is primarily undertaken by researchers who are based outside the academy. As a result they do not usually enjoy easy access to academic journals or other academic publications. To ensure they are aware of the research avenues and outputs of the project Dr Caroline Bressey and Dr Gemma Romain will work with the Black Cultural Archives, London (BCA) and the Black and Asian Studies Association (BASA) to ensure these scholars are informed of the material that is recovered through talks and seminars, BASA Jiscmail list and the BASA Newsletter (currently published x3 a year). In addition copies of academic publications, the exhibition catalogues/information leaflets and other published outputs will be deposited with the BCA library.\n\nThe archives targeted for research by the project will benefit from enhanced interpretations of their collections as a result of the original research taking place. The material identified through the research process will be collated into a database and each archive will be given an electronic and hard copy of the catalogue, highlighting cross-cutting themes relevant to their collections. In addition the database, which will give details of objects (such as works of art and their provenance, relevant political journals, diaries as well as highlighting links between objects) and details of how researchers may access them will be provided via the UCL Equiano Centre website - www.ucl.ac.uk/equianocentre.\n\nBased on the material on the database, an online exhibition will consist of digitalised images with supporting narratives on targeted objects from the database. Some of these digital objects will also form the basis of an online workshop that will be developed for sixth form students with the UCL Strang Print Room, a study centre with access to the UCL Art Collections and a gallery with a public exhibition programme. Accompanying teacher's notes developed with colleagues at City and Islington College will be available to download from the UCL Equiano Centre website.\n\nTwo exhibitions are planned to be curated during the life of the project. A small exhibition will display student work inspired by prints, paintings and other objects relevant to the project held at the UCL Strang Print Room in 2012, and a display of artworks is planned to be shown at Tate Britain in 2013 (see letter of support attached). Both exhibitions will have an annotated catalogue and/or information leaflet. The Walking tour will be developed by Dr Romain. It will be modelled on a walk Exploring London's Black History, which Romain created in 2008 and will enable the general public to engage with the many sites including those which no longer exist such as The Florence Mills Club, a haunt of black intellectuals during the 1930s. An online version of the walk will be developed through a google mash-up to enable access for those who wish to undertake the walk themselves. This map will be hosted on the Equiano Centre website and follow a similar design for that created for Black Londoners 1800-1900 developed by Dr Bressey.

The details of over 600 artworks, artists, and individuals of African and Asian heritage linked with the interwar artworld from DCL have been drawn together and compiled onto a database which will be made public in January 2015.

Drawing Over the Colour Line engaged in several successful planned public engagement outputs during the life of the project. These were:
? The establishment of Queer Black Spaces, an event which took place in February 2013 exploring queer black history in relation to visual culture. This event was attended by over 100 people
? Black Bloomsbury, the autumn 2013 UCL Art Museum exhibition of material from UCL special collections and UCL Art Museum curated by the Drawing Over the Colour Line project team
? The awarding of a UCL Grand Challenge grant to project member Gemma Romain and UCL colleague Debbie Challis (Petrie Museum, UCL) to create a collaborative project and exhibition between the Equiano Centre and the Petrie Museum on the influence of ancient Egyptian sculpture on modernist artists, including Jacob Epstein and Ronald Moody (two artists from the Drawing Over the Colour Line project). This exhibition, A Fusion of Worlds: Ancient Egypt, African Art and Identity in Modernist Britain, took place at the Petrie Museum from 11 March to 24 May 2014
? The creation of two self-guided walking tours, one on Soho and one on Bloomsbury
? The creation of postcards of artwork distributed to local libraries and venues in various locations 
? In 2012 running a one-day workshop with AS level students at City and Islington College which included a guided walking tour of Black Bloomsbury, a discussion about the Black presence in London and its with the art world of the 1920s and 1930s, and the students wrote blog posts based upon their encounter with artworks from the UCL Art Museum which feature in DCL. The day resulted in a pop-up exhibition at UCL Art Museum, highlighting the artworks and students writings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6704B26A-F378-4F93-BF9E-37A843B4DCE0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Drawing Over the Colour Line explored and documented the interaction between the African and Asian presence in inter-war London and the city's art world. Our research focused on uncovering and analysing the links between the art world and the Black presence in London, concentrating on the diverse and complex hidden histories of artist models of African and Asian heritage whose lives have left a trace in memoirs, archival documentation as well as many artworks. We explored these hidden histories by searching through interwar exhibition catalogues, newspapers such as the Illustrated London News, through auction houses and physical archives including the archives of the UCL Slade School of Fine Art, Hornsey Art School, the Royal Academy, the Royal College of Art and Camberwell School of Art, as well as The National Archives, the Henry Moore Institute, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library, the archives of Yale Center for British Art. We uncovered histories relating to several Indian artists who studied at the Slade and the Royal College of Art, we uncovered visual evidence of artists models of African heritage who posed for students in the Slade School of Fine Art. We also uncovered stories of networks of friendship, romance and political interactions between black interwar individuals (artists, writers, activists, and artists' models) and the art world, including figures such as the Jamaican born activists and writer Claude McKay, the Jamaican feminist, poet and broadcaster Una Marson, the writer and activist Mulk Raj Anand, CLR James, the author of the Black Jacobins, and the Africa American entertainer Jimmie Daniels.
