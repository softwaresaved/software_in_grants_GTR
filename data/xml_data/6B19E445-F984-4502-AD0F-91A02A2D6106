The experimental regimen consists of moxifloxacin, clofazimine, ethambutol and pyrazinamide given for 9 months supplemented by kanamycin, isoniazid and prothionamide in the four months of the intensive phase; the continuation phase lasts 5 months. Standard doses are given for all drugs except for isoniazid and moxifloxacin which are given in higher doses. All drugs are given daily (seven days a week) except for kanamycin which is given daily for 3 months and then thrice-weekly subsequently. The intensive phase and total duration may be extended by up to two months if sputum smears are slow to convert. Patients on the control regimen will receive the locally-used WHO-approved MDR-TB regimen, given for a minimum of 18 months after culture conversion; this commonly takes 4-6 months and so most standard regimens last approximately two years. 

Patients will be randomised to either the experimental regimen or the locally-used WHO-approved MDR-TB regimen in the ratio 2:1 and be followed up to 27 months post-randomisation. 

The primary efficacy outcome is status at the end of follow-up i.e. the proportion of patients with a favourable bacteriological outcome 27 months after randomisation, provided they have not already been classified as unfavourable. Change of more than one drug for adverse reactions or any other reason is considered an unfavourable outcome. The primary safety outcome is the proportion of patients experiencing a grade 3 or greater adverse event during treatment and follow-up.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine 2010; 182 684-92</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Currently there are almost half a million new cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) each year of which a negligible proportion are being diagnosed and even less are treated. Among those that are treated the results are poor, a recent meta-analysis of studies reported a median favourable outcome of only 65%. There has never been a phase III trial to evaluate treatment regimens for MDR-TB and WHO recommendations are currently based almost entirely on expert opinion with a low level of supporting evidence. 

The results achieved in the cohort study conducted by Van Deun and colleagues in Bangladesh were impressive both in respect of the high level of relapse free cure obtained, 88% two years after starting treatment, and the short duration of the regimen, 9 months compared to durations in excess of 18 months currently recommended by WHO for this patient group. 

If the STREAM study is successful in reproducing outcomes similar to those obtained in Bangladesh there will be immediate implications for the treatment of MDR-TB world-wide. The WHO Guidelines Department Trials of new drugs for MDR-TB are in the planning stage but none will be starting before 2012 at the earliest. 

The impact at field level could be considerable; a short, relatively inexpensive but highly effective treatment would be very attractive to National TB Programmes who would be able to treat more patients thereby also reducing the pool of infectious MDR-TB patients in the community thus impacting not only on the prevalence but incidence of new cases.

The Director of the STOP-TB Department of WHO has welcomed the STREAM study as being an important initiative to address the serious public health problem posed by MDR-TB.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>National TB programme workshop on MDR-TB</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>808911AB-C08D-4681-8AC6-9C47B8DF1F8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Health professionals and policy makers attended an MSF workshop in Myanmar - policy makers considering adoption of alternative MDR-TB treatment

Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are currently treated for 18-24 months, based on recommendations by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Treatment success rates are poor. 

In a study carried out by Dr. Van Deun (2010) in Bangladesh patients with MDR-TB were treated for only nine months with excellent results. 

The STREAM trial assesses whether a treatment closely similar to that used in Bangladesh is as good as the treatment for MDR-TB recommended by WHO. If the results are positive, it will be possible to treat patients with MDR-TB in different countries for only nine months.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF41A0E9-C773-40EB-BE5A-B498F4E6080B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This will be the first randomised phase III trial in MDR-TB; current treatment recommendations are based only on expert opinion.
