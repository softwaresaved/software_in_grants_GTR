The methods we employ and develop are mainly situated in the wider field of corpus linguistics, in which digitised versions of texts and customised software are used to find recurrent textual patterns which operate both above and below the level of explicit conscious awareness. Many frequently-occurring literary patterns fall below consciousness, and yet have been demonstrated to have lingering readerly effects and important consequences for the process of characterisation (Stockwell 2009). This insight has important implications for the cognitive poetic work of literary linguists, as we will show with our project. We suggest an innovative approach by combining corpus linguistic methods with research questions from cognitive poetics, specifically the way that readers engage in 'mind-modelling' in the process of characterisation (Stockwell 2002). In particular, we are interested in the textual patterns that contribute to the reader's perception of fictional characters. As a case study, we focus on novels by Charles Dickens, an author who is renowned for his skilful creation of fictional characters and his rich characterisation. We will study textual patterns in the speech of characters and ways in which the descriptive body language that accompanies speech is presented in the text.

We have conducted initial pilot studies which suggest that textual patterns brought to light with the help of computer
methods provide an entirely new perspective on the textual techniques of characterisation (Mahlberg 2012, Mahlberg &amp;amp; Smith 2012, Mahlberg et al. forthcoming). Based on these initial findings, the current project aims to significantly extend our previous work by developing a tool - CLiC - that supports the analysis of fictional speech and literary body language. CLiC (Corpus Linguistics in Cheshire) will be a web-based tool for searching and annotating (literary) texts. It is particularly effective in complex searches, pinpointing target words, phrases and structures in relation to other interesting features (quoted speech, thought presentation, body language descriptions) and positions in the text (near chapter and paragraph breaks, narrated or reported material). CLiC will help to provide an empirical foundation for the development of an overarching cognitive poetic interpretative framework for the analysis of fictional characters. Hence we will suggest an approach that brings corpus linguistics and cognitive poetics together in innovative ways.
We will make CLiC freely available on the web so that other researchers can use the tool. CLiC and the fundamental
theoretical insights of our approach also have relevance more widely for the teaching of literature. We aim to illustrate the potential of the tool and our approach by running workshops, including events for students and teachers. We will also publish an Activity Book (a hands-on research manual and coursebook) with fully-worked analyses arising from the research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Though the previous section focuses on academic beneficiaries, it is likely that some of the forms of dissemination in the course of the project will also be accessed by non-academic groups: our blogs, vodcasts and web-presence have a wider audience. We have also identified the following groups who are likely to be interested in or will benefit from our research:

1. Schoolteachers of English literature. In the free CLiC Guidelines we include simple examples for the exploration of
characterisation techniques that teachers can either use immediately or adapt for use in the classroom. With the focus on Dickens, we have chosen a canonical author in the curriculum so our examples are of direct continuing relevance to current classroom practice. We have established contact with professional teacher bodies (e.g. NATE - the National Association of the Teachers of English) with a view to reaching this group.

2. Students of English literature in secondary schools. Students can be introduced to CLiC by their teachers, but they might also find our webpage by themselves, and our approach and tools are presented clearly enough to be accessible. We know that usability is effective from our experience with trialling the current version of CLiC in our teaching. We will also offer a workshop through the University's outreach and widening participation (WP) activities, so we provide direct opportunities for students to try out the current version of CLiC. These WP activities address students who would not necessarily consider studying at university. By linking technology with literature, CLiC offers such students entirely new ways of studying literature: a further source of motivation towards literary engagement at any level.

3. Designers and publishers of teaching materials. Because of the direct relevance of our research for innovative teaching methods and approaches, there is a clear offer of impact for curriculum design and the development of teaching materials. Both investigators have experience in developing teaching materials and coursebooks for school and university, both in the UK and internationally. We also have influence through various Examination and governmental advisory groups, with the potential for including this research in both curriculum design and assessment. There is clearly an economic impact for publishers in the influence of our work, but also a public good. Increasingly, teaching materials and curriculum designers are turning to textual analysis and stylistics as sources of innovative content both in the UK and overseas.

4. The English Language Teaching (ELT) sector. Overseas, English literature plays an important role in ELT. Corpus
linguistics has already had a major impact on ELT, and Nottingham has a key track-record in this area through our links with Cambridge University Press and our long record of teacher-training and professional development in applied linguistics. Our research can extend this impact by shaping the teaching of literature through corpus-assisted methods and materials.

5. The general public. It is important to recognise that Dickens is generally regarded as a major author who (after
Shakespeare) is probably the most popular English writer (in terms of continuing popularity) and arguably the most read. The numerous events during Dickens' bicentenary celebrations in 2012 are a reflection of this popularity, reaching out from the academic domain into screen adaptations, readings, school events, tourist promotions and even a theme park (Dickens World)! Our research latches on to this general and genuine interest in Dickens, particularly since his characters are popularly regarded as the most noteworthy and appealing dimension of his writing. Dickensian characters take on a life of their own in the popular imagination, and our research taps into this cultural phenomenon and reflects on it.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59236</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P504634/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
