Moreover, they are the only cause of 1 in 5 of all animal species extinctions. Preventing invasions is the best strategy to avoid long-term environmental and economic damage. Not all alien species become established and widespread in a novel region. Indentifying future successful invaders before they colonize vast areas is essential for effective prevention measures; this, however, is still a poorly resolved task. 

One way to identify potential future invaders is to systematically test whether successful alien species share common biological traits that promote their invasion success. For example, do successful invaders have broad ecological niches that enable them to find and exploit resources in non-native regions? Among vertebrates, invasive birds share key characteristics that facilitate the establishment of alien populations, such as broader diet, greater number of habitats where they can thrive, and sedentary (as opposed to migratory) habits. Little is known, however, of what makes other vertebrates invasive; yet fish, mammals, reptiles and amphibians are often problematic invaders and are introduced outside their native range at an increasing pace. 

Even in well-studied groups such as birds, most research has focused on the establishment of alien populations. Crucially, however, not all established alien populations become widespread; yet it is spread in the novel region, not establishment, that makes a species invasive. Moreover, what promotes establishment success does not necessarily promote spread in the non-native environment. Therefore, conclusions of studies on establishment success might be little informative for understanding whether an alien (established) species will colonize vast areas. Currently, our knowledge of the potential determinants of spread in vertebrates is extremely limited.

Likewise the early stages of invasion, when prevention measures can be most effective, are the least understood. The influence of human activities at these early stages is considered crucial, particularly for vertebrates that are often transported and introduced intentionally. For example, introduced alien birds are not a random group but do exhibit common characteristics. It has been proposed that such characteristics reflect human preferences for birds introduced as 'commodities', e.g. for hunting, or for 'ornamental' purposes. Whether this is the case, however, has yet to be tested. In this regard, the pet trade and urban environments might play an important role in biological invasions, since alien vertebrates traded as 'pets' might later be released or escape in urban areas where they can establish alien populations, some of which may become invasive. However, whether and to what extent the pet trade and urban areas promote invasions success has not yet been investigated.

We will compile a comprehensive global database of success and failure at introduction, establishment and spread in non-avian vertebrates, and test hypotheses on the determinants of success at each stage of invasion at the global scale. We will use state of art phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the role of human preferences and activities at each stage of invasion, and test whether successful invaders exhibit reproductive and ecological characteristics that distinguish them from unsuccessful ones at each stage of the invasion pathway. This project will enable us to: understand how human preferences and activities facilitate non-avian vertebrates' introduction and success into novel environments; reveal what traits, if any, successful invaders share at each stage of invasion; determine the relative importance of human related factors versus species traits in explaining invasion success; assess the generality of conclusions for vertebrates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Professional conservation biologists, government agencies, such as DEFRA, and policy makers will be the main beneficiaries of this project. The results of this project will help inform, formulate and improve existing policies and management plans dealing with alien non-avian vertebrates. The first part of the project will be important for policies regulating the pet trade and human activities and preferences that may promote biological invasions. The second part of the project will be beneficial for biodiversity conservation and management policies and plans related to already present alien non-avian vertebrates, since it will help identify possible future invasive species on the basis of their biological characteristics. This will be particularly important for prevention measures particularly when applied to recently introduced species. 

Dissemination of results through peer-reviewed papers, presentation at major international conferences attended by both academics and professional conservation biologists, such as ICCB and ESA meetings, dissemination of results through the media and through public lectures, the construction of a regularly updated and maintained project website with an associated database, will ensure that the widest community of potential beneficiaries is reached promptly and can benefit directly from the results of this project. In addition, the outreach activities will help raise awareness among the general public regarding the potential role of human preferences and activities, such as the pet trade, in biological invasions. The PI and PDRA will present at the ICCB and ESA meetings to ensure dissemination of results to professional conservation biologists and academics. Funding to cover travel costs to attend these conferences have been requested. 

The PI and PDRA will be in regular contact with the University of Hull Media Centre and the Knowledge Exchange Team who will assist in the dissemination of results through outreach activities. The RA will develop and maintain the project website and database that will be made available to anyone once all papers arising from this project are published. Throughout the project, sections of the database will be made available through the project website as datasets associated with each published paper. The University of Hull IT team will assist the RA in the early construction of the project website within the University website, and the University server will host the project database. Funding as salary is overall essential in order to hire a RA that will in part assist in the data collection of the project, in part be responsible for the development and management of the project website and database.

The PI has gained extensive experience in database and website construction and maintenance, and public engagement through interviews with the media and public lectures throughout her career, and will help, train and assist the PDRA and RA in carrying out these activities. In addition the PI attended the NERC Science Communication workshop in 2009. Funding is requested for the PDRA to attend the NERC Science Communication workshop in the first year of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>504240</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Univ. of Edinburgh Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>40DD1278-E3F1-497D-B0B1-C385845EF649</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar speaker, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, September): A global scale approach to biological invasions</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting for NERC highlight topic group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C06AA3D5-BE7A-4C5D-AF43-43BFC3454B18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Isabella Capellini was invited to the meeting and helped developing a proposal for a NERC highlight topic on biological invasions (to be submitted asap) in 2016 (held at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallington)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentations 2015 &amp; 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7878C347-8A4B-42F5-AB12-B5CFE3B487D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several international conference presentations given by the 3 PDRAs working on this project (Drs Sally Street, Jorge Gutierrez, Will Allen) are listed under 'Other activities'</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Invasive alien species can threaten biodiversity, disrupt ecosystem functioning and services, and cause huge economic loss. However, not all organisms introduced outside their native range survive and reproduce, and among those that do, only some become widespread (i.e. 'invasive'). Why introduction outcomes are so diverse is still an open question. In this project we investigate if successful invasive vertebrates share characteristics that promote their success. The grant is near the end of its second of three years.

So far we have compiled a dataset of invasion success of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians at the global scale, which we are currently using to test ideas about which species' traits facilitate their success. 

Our first paper, published in Ecology Letters (Capellini et al 2015) demonstrates that humans introduce preferentially long lived and highly productive species, characteristics that first increase the probability of establishing in novel regions, and subsequently sustain the remarkable range expansion typical of 'invasive' species. We conclude that greater productivity supports population growth and successful alien mammals are hyper-productive. In our more recent paper we demonstrate that results in mammals are not unique: on the contrary, also highly productive amphibians and reptiles are better 'invaders' in novel regions, and we introduce species that already have high potential to invade (Allen et al 2017 Ecology Letters).

We are currently writing up the results for other hypotheses on the drivers of invasion success in terrestrial vertebrates.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our first published paper on the role of life history traits in mammalian invasion success is available as open access here:
