Assessment of SOIL quality using a BIOindicator (SoilBio)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/N004779/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Due to population growth, demand for grain is expected to double worldwide by 2050, increasing pressure on soil. Direct
degradation threats to soils are manifold, including erosion, salinisation, compaction, loss of organic matter, landslides,
contamination and sealing. All of these pressures have major impacts on soils in Europe, where 16% of all soils are
considered to be damaged. With approximately 40% of agricultural soils, already suffering degradation, protection of soil
quality is clearly critical, the alternative being further conversion of natural ecosystems. For protection to be successful the
generation of rapid monitoring tools that provide simple understandable output is essential.
Decline of soil fertility, carbon and biodiversity; lower water retention capacity, disruption of gas and nutrient cycles and
reduced degradation of contaminants are among the results of soil erosion processes. In Europe, there is an increasing list
of legislation relating to the protection of soils as a result of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. Despite this
increasing policy requirement for effective monitoring of soils at local-, regional- and national-scales, it remains unclear
which properties of soils are the most appropriate to monitor. This is partly because of the numerous goods and services
that soils provide, but also because of their inherent chemical, physical and biological complexity. Numerous UK policy
documents have recommended a national soil quality monitoring scheme although, as within Europe, no single indicator
has been established due to the complexity of the soil system. It is therefore likely that a number of tools will be required to
adequately follow shifts in soil health. Globally, soils are under severe pressure from both anthropogenic and environmental
sources thus protection of soils is of paramount importance. For protection to be successful the generation of rapid
monitoring tools that provide simple understandable outputs is essential. As biota have fundamental roles in the majority of
soil ecosystem services, they are logical candidates as effective proxy indicators of soil health/quality. Nematodes are
considered potential candidate biological indicators due to their abundance, diversity and rapid generation times as well as
relative ease of extraction from soil.
In this project we will uniquely integrate traditional tests of soil chemistry with physical (penetrometer resistance and bulk
density) and biological components (nematodes) of the soil system to measure soil quality. We will conduct a significant
soil sampling campaign to mimic the scale of a national monitoring programme and calibrate our results against a spectrum
of soil qualities. This will generate spatial field mapping of soil quality for the grower available through a subscription based
service and provide input to an on-farm precision agriculture framework that targets in-field areas for improvement of soil quality, increasing yields but at the same time reducing inputs as broad spectrum whole field mitigating actions are not
required.
Such a system places the UK in a demonstrable leading role of soil and environmental protection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Anthropogenic pressures have major impacts on soils in Europe, where 40% of agricultural soils are already suffering degradation.

drink sector has a turnover of &amp;pound;76Billion (2012), representing one of the largest manufacturing sector of the UK economy.
This represents 15% gross value added (GVA) of all UK manufacturing which supports 400,000 UK jobs equivalent to
approximately 16% of all manufacturing jobs (Office National Statistics, 2014). Our project will underpin the continued
success of the UK agricultural industry and its contribution to the UK food and drink manufacturing sector. Contingent with
the terms of the agreed collaboration agreement, key information would be cascaded through the UK agricultural industry
by primarily engaging with AHDB-Potato Council, HGCA, HDC (field vegetables sector) and BBRO to generate maximum
impact of the study. Improving soil quality or more accurately identifying fields or in-field where soil quality requires
improvement by using the tools that this project will deliver will reduce on-farm inputs with significant concomitant
environmental benefits and reduce production costs. Furthermore by addressing soil quality which contributes to crop
health will reduce food waste thus addressing a 2014 House of Lords report (Counting the Cost of Food Waste: EU Food
Waste Prevention), which included food loss as a consequence of disease in the definition of food waste which currently
stands across the EU at 39% for the whole food and drink manufacturing sector.
Furthermore, developing and deploying a tool that operates on the scale of a national sampling programme addresses both
national (DEFRA, Environment Agency, Scottish Government) and international (EU) policies for the protection of soils that
to date have not been achievable. Hence a successful delivery of this project has a significant enhancement of the UK
environmental credentials on the global stage.
A modest improvement in yield by 5% across all crops as a result of improved soil qality assessment has the potential to
realise a &amp;gt; &amp;pound;1Billion p.a. in overall production value to the UK economy. Improvements in crop quality would also accrue
increased revenue through premier product pricing.
Consortium partners will benefit both economically and reputationally from successful delivery of this project. The industrial
partners (SoilEssentials and Scottish Agronomy) will accrue new revenue streams from the provision of service, Mack
Multiples as an early adopter of the monitoring system will have a competitive UK marketplace advantage which will be
translated to consumers through its significant supply chain network and MRS will benefit through further enhancement of
its reputation as a successful facilitator of translational science. The academic partners would also benefit from enhanced
reputation in the specific research arena which has potential to be translated into further competitive research funding
through downstream funding calls such as Horizon 2020 further leveraging monies into the UK economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97604</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Highland Show (Edinburgh)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B7F1AD6C-550C-4517-BAB6-58D05753449E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Royal Highland Show is a major national agricultural event spread over 3 days.
