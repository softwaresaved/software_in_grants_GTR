curating and representing knowledge</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K008048/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project explores how making, curating and representing knowledge might offer new creative ways of understanding the social world. The popularity of digital technologies has changed not only the subject matter for many researchers but the possibilities of communicating and circulating findings. By focusing on inventive methods and modes of transmission, this project recognises the shift from digital technologies as subject matter and method to critical transmission tools and sites of knowledge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It takes two parts:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Transmissions and Entanglements - a series of meetings that bring together interdisciplinary practitioners to discuss and debate the possibilities and consequences of new forms of knowledge transmission.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Freedom of Movement - a new research project that engages in alternate ways of representing findings as they emerge in real time. It draws on archival resources to explore the materiality of late nineteenth century cyclewear in legitimising women?s presence in public space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The novelty of the project lies in interweaving archival research with the making of garments from 130 year old patents in collaboration with an artist, weaver, tailor and filmmaker.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Outputs include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>material garments&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>short films&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>website/blog&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>journal articles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>symposium&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>presentations&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>public exhibition&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal will benefit:
(1) INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGY RESEARCHERS
The project will directly benefit technology industry researchers (-anthropologists, sociologists, designers) at Intel's Interaction and Experience group (US). Led by director Dr Genevieve Bell, this research team has an established interest in innovative methods and experiments in the translation of knowledge to interdisciplinary stakeholders and audiences. Researchers are multi-disciplinary which is essential for the constant and critical challenges of conducting research and then translating it to a range of stakeholders (ie. media, engineers, designers, retailers). 

How will they benefit?
- Key members learn new ways of working that explore and exploit new technologies in their translation projects and circulate findings back to peers
- The event develops a non-US footprint of leading players in this field that Intel can draw from for events, talks, reference 
- The event develops a series of case studies

Potential impacts arising from the project:
- Dr Bell incorporates findings of the project/s in one of her publicized keynotes thereby extending the project reach 
- Highlights from the event published on Intel's public blog 
- Dr Bell and PI continue to develop collaborative research 
- Collaborative activities emerge between industry researchers and others
- Co-edited publications/ events 

(2) KNOWLEDGE PRACTITIONERS
The project will also directly benefit a range of knowledge practitioners such as civil service and cultural institution workers, campaigners, writers, designers and artists with an interest in communicating complex ideas to a range of publics. The project will benefit this group by bringing to light cutting edge research utilizing digital technologies and new sites of knowledge. Specifically, for cycle campaigners, the new project builds on the ESRC funded 'Cycling Cultures' research, which involved UK campaigners, council officers, urban planners and activists. Although historically based, the project is relevant as it focuses on why what cyclists wear is still important in carving out a legitimate presence on the road and in understanding what restricted women cyclists 130 years ago, will provide insights into why British women's cycling uptake remains low today. The nature of the project (collaboration, garments, exhibitions) provides new ways to attract media /general public attention to enduring debates.

How will they benefit?
- Short policy report provide keys insights to practitioners
- 'Freedom of Movement' provides new ways of talking about key cycling issues 
- Participants exposed to new ways of working and apply new methods 
- Participants expand and develop their collaborative networks

Potential impacts arising from the project:
- Participants return to their studio/office/school and share findings with others
- New collaborations emerge between participants in the form of new projects, publications, joint funding bids 

(3) SPECIALIST GROUPS AND GENERAL PUBLIC
Indirectly, the proposal will impact on specialist organizations and companies such as Dashing Tweeds, Look Mum No Hands and the general public. 

How will they benefit?
- The new research project will provide relevant 'content for specialist cycling groups, attracting new and diverse audiences to their websites /newsletters 
- The use of Dashing Tweeds fabric will expose the brand in new contexts might drive sales 
- Exhibition and associate events (talk, organized bike ride) will attract new audiences to sites and demonstrate their support for the cycling community

Potential impacts arising from the project:
- A series of material and technological artefacts (garments, website, film, talk) will be available to present/exhibit 
- The website/blog will receive comments and hits from viewers
- The project will attract attention from larger institutions such as Transport for London resulting in invites to talk/exhibit</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75652</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The research team collaborated with an artist, Alice Angus who produced a series of unique visual artworks for each of the 5 costumes. These artworks brought to life the stories of the inventors and patent holders, their key influences and central themes revealed in their designs. Alice worked in the studio with the research team, directly responding to the team's findings and methodological process. She was involved in discussions about the process of conducting an ethnography of making the Victorian Cycling Costumes, the decisions, unexpected happenings, mistakes and challenges along the way. These conversation this sparked rich and complex conversations about method and findings and informed the content and feel of each drawing as it developed. The novelty of the project lies in interweaving archival research with the making of a range of garments, drawn from historic patents in collaboration with contemporary craft practitioners (artist, weaver and tailor). Although collaborations of this nature are not new, the novelty of this project lies in an explicit engagement in the process of making, curating and representing knowledge. It will bring to life findings from the symposium and workshops and provide a platform for discussion and debate about different working practices. Documenting the process, giving talks and exhibiting the results will bring to life multi-dimensional engagements with ideas, practices and technologies, extending PI's skills and offering new entry points into social science research for a non-academic communities. The illustrations were digitally printed onto silk and sewn into each garment as lining. The linings are only revealed when the garment is converted from ordinary street wear into cycle wear. The finished linings are the a record of, and result of those intense drawing activities as well as an interpretation of the research. They operate as another layer of findings in the project and operate as a story telling device when the garments are work and performed.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AC5D3E8E-083F-457D-AB60-8A6D6EC269C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The linings operate as an important part of the project in that the research team can draw on them to tell stories about the process of doing the project and the findings that emerged in the making of each of the Victorian garments. Audience members at talks often specifically ask about the linings of the garments, their illustrative nature triggering conversation and questions. The fact they are sewn in as lining adds another layer to the performance which has delighted audiences and has much to do with the ongoing request that the research team has received to give talks in costume or take the project on tour to different places and for different types of audiences. We have also received many requests to purchase the illustrations in consumable forms such as scarves.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Digitally printed silk linings: Art/ sociology collaboration</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://proboscis.org.uk/?s=kat</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>1 x doublesided colour poster that doubled as the conference program</gtr:description><gtr:id>586D2AD6-DC74-43D8-BF68-63CC21751DFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The poster helped to generate interest in the public events in the 4 day event.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Poster: Transmissions and Entanglements #3 program</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://transmissionsandentanglements.com/?p=483</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>7 x Open Access Downloadable PDF Sewing Pattern Packs</gtr:description><gtr:id>EBFBEA06-A61D-4D21-8EF0-5CF3A2834880</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These packs will be launched in Spring 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Open Access Downloadable PDF Sewing Pattern Packs</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bikesandbloomers.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A3 colour single sided poster that advertised a public talk by Dr Genevieve Bell of Intel, Director of Interaction, Experience and Research.

This garment was patented by Madam Julia Gill on 16th Feb 1895. It is for 'A Cycling Costume for Ladies'. It consists of an 'ordinary' skirt that transforms into safe and comfortable cycle wear via a cord threaded through a series of rings that are hidden underneath a double frill at the base of the skirt. The wearer raises and tightens the cord, gathering the base of the skirt at the waist, therefore raising it out of the way of the wheels. The double frill, operating as a peplum, hides the gathering device. The skirt is fully lined with an artwork by Alice Angus that brings to life details of the patent, life of the inventor and influences of the time that would have shaped her invention. This garment is part of a lager ensemble made to complete the Victorian cycling costume. In addition to the skirt the research team made a blouse, bloomers, jacket, scarf and hat decorations.</gtr:description><gtr:id>42861B98-0598-49F6-A0BD-5D5E8A6CFE9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This garment has been worn to present the project findings in various academic and more public contexts.

The research findings were used by the producers to bring to life the social and cultural history of corsets - the sewing task for participants of that week's program. The PI was interviewed about the history of Rational Dress, importance of cycling for women and changes to the nature of gendered mobility in public space. The program featured footage of the RA dressed in one of the project's cycling costumes. Although this was only a small piece in a larger show, it is clear evidence of the relevance of the theme of the research for a contemporary sewing/popular history audience. The size of the audience was also massively beyond regular exposure for a small research project.

Feminism and the history of cycling is an increasingly popular topic for media. It is probable that thie BBC show was one of the catalysts for the use of the Bikes &amp;amp; Bloomers research in a Guardian article about how the bicycle has been a creative tool for women's liberation throughout the last century. The article has only been published for a few days but it has already been shared 723 times. The journalist referenced the website, the PI and a core finding in the research - the invention of convertible cycle wear by women cyclists. Over the week this has resulted in 1113 page views on www.bikesandbloomers.com

The aim was to stimulate student engagement with critical making practices in research. The workshop began with a lecture followed by discussion about key themes and ideas in the research. The students spent the rest of the day making and customising their own versions of 1890s cycling bloomers from patterns and instructions provided by the research team. Not only did they spent the whole day working on these materials but also invested time throughout the following week but several also contacted the research team for extra guidance and to talk through ideas. This was the first Bloomer Making Workshop and it was so successful that I ran four full day events during the project and two smaller versions at other public events.

Students were invited to presented their final pieces at our 'Show and Tell: Dresses, Drinks and Data' event in the Sociology Dept at Goldsmiths - http://bikesandbloomers.com/show-tell-dresses-drinks-and-data/ This event opened up the studio, revealing our practices and work-in-progress to interested staff and students. Students wore their garments to the event, demonstrated them and talked about the experience of getting into a research project by literally making a garment. Months later, several also advised the research team that their final work was influenced by their participation in the workshop.

I was part of an expert panel - Alan Latham (University College London), Ian Garrard (Brunel University) and Jo Wood (City University London).

Questions in the discussion afterwards opened up issues around contemporary cycle wear, how women still report abuse from fellow road users and how this might be factors contributing to low women's cycling rates.

This is evidenced by an invitation to participate in the London Science Museum 'Late' in March 2015. Held monthly, Science Museum 'Lates' attract audiences in excess of 4000. Politically, this was a valuable opportunity to locate the innovations of lesser-known women inventors in a prestigious science institution. The fact that a project on Victorian women's cycle wear was invited to be part of a 'Late' on 'Wearable Technology' was also evidence of the relevance of the research to a contemporary audience and popular area of interest. The PI was invited to set up a pop-up exhibition and present/perform (twice) during the evening. This involved a 20min talk, demonstration of Victorian convertible cycling costumes and the audience was invited to try on a range of available garments and see how they felt on a stationary period bike. The response was very positive and energetic, to the point where participants were still dressed in garments when the second talk commenced.

Unsolicited feedback from the Science Museum: &amp;quot;Thanks again for your marvellous talk at the Science Museum. We got such great feedback from the audience, I only wish we could have had it three times rather than two on the night!&amp;quot;

The talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards about the role of women in Victorian society, cycle wear and citizenship. I was asked for copies of the talk and powerpoint slides. We then started a making/sewing session with a range of materials I supplied. I offered participates three different ways of getting into my research: Try on some of my hand0made 1890s garments, read through some of the printed copies of cycle wear patents and make small scale versions of or make a Victorian tie-on pocket. People enthusiastically got involved in all theree activities and I barely had to time to take any photos as people were constantly telling me terrific stories about past cycling family members, asking questions about garments or showing me their sewing results.


One of the participants who tried on one of the convertible cycling garments produced a time-lapse video - http://bikesandbloomers.com/brilliant-stop-motion-animation-of-the-pease-sisters-cycling-cape/

I was asked if I would run more of the full day bloomer making workshops. I invited people to put their names on a list if they wanted more information about any upcoming talks or events and 15 people put their names on the list.

I received emails from participants afterwards telling me how much it appealed to people of all ages - &amp;quot;My niece and nephew really enjoyed it. My nephew really found it an interesting topic - so glad he soaked it all up. My niece enjoyed the sewing&amp;quot;

My blog post documenting the event was retweeted by a range of people with large followings - Genevieve Bell, Intel Fellow (10.8K followers), Ben Hammersley, Technology writer (14.3K followers), Dallas Campbell (11.6K followers) and Feminism in London (1685 followers)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://bikesandbloomers.com/fil-2014-suffrage-cycling-and-sewing-a-story-telling-making-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk: Web Development Skills: Improving Digital Literacy for ECRs in Academic Practice, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>96DA8D7A-E983-4ADC-94B1-B7F8D80C7A4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My experience and expertise in knowledge exchange and digital technology research practices was identified by colleagues at the University of East Anglia and Queen Mary. Together we ran a one-day intensive workshop on Web Development Skills. My talk on 'Web Design Principles - Visual Web Literacy' focusd both on the design aspects of academic websites and on collaborations between academia and non-HEIs, in both engagement and enterprise'. It sparked discussion about the epistemological and practical challenges of digital research. 


Participants in the workshop were very enthusiastic about my work and we discussed various issues - benefits, challenges and practicalities of manning an online research identity. They were tasked with putting their new found skills into practice and I am involved in a design-crit of their final work in Dec 2014. I was also invited, given the success of the project, to be part of a further bid to re-run and extend the project in 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://chasedigitalliteracy.wordpress.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk: Research Seminar Series, Edinburgh College of Art, Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>438F9EA0-1B89-460D-990A-2CC5A3780DAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I delivered a talk while dressed in one of the initial versions of a Victorian Cycling Costume- (Extra) Ordinary Cycle Wear: Historic patents, convertible clothing and the contested nature of gendered mobility in Victorian Britain.

After the talk/ demonstration I was invited to speak at Temporal Design: An Interdisciplinary Workshop 28-29th May 2014, Edinburgh College of Art, University of Edinburgh.

It included talks, DiY sewing workshops, performances, exhibitions and even a curated bike ride around London. It involved open public events and smaller more intimate invited interdisciplinary events to enable opportunities for making, discussions and debates. It brought together a range of people who translate and transmit their research findings in inventive ways and resist tidying or flattening their research in order to represent it, instead actively and often provocatively maintaining both openness and complexity in research outputs. This kind of work re-inhabits the social world, entangling with bodies and ideas and inviting unexpected happenings. We will explore through hands-on object oriented and embodied means a spectrum of modes of description and debate their potential for unlocking new expressions of the social. It was an exciting and exhausting week but it was generative of discussion around key themes in the project and also further consolidated the network of inventive practitioners that I had been developing through the project.

I received lots of positive feedback from participants: For eg. Many said that it provided an opportunity 'To feel at home instead of always having to defend a practice' and 'Thanks once again for inviting us to your amazing gathering this summer! It's super-thrilling to be around you and in the events that you put together.

It brought together speakers from sociology, technology development, design and art history. Talks addressed the impact of the work of INCITE - Incubator for Critical Inquiry into Technology and Enquiry - over the last decade and look forward to the new theoretical and methodological agendas which are being forged by its former students and researchers.The event featured contributions from eight speakers who had been aligned to INCITE at some point throughout the last ten years. It was quickly oversubscribed by MA Visual Sociology and Digital Sociology students as well as other related courses.

Some of the questions that my talk addressed:
What are the opportunities and challenges for social research and sociological methodology as they encounter the worlds of technology development and design?
Does social research emerge more creative and inventive in these collaborative engagements, or merely face series of disappointments?
Is it a process of translation or transformation? How can we think critically about such attempts to participate in making?


After the talk I was contacted by several MA and PhD students to talk about the benefits and challenges of engaging in practice-based research using experimental methods.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://transmissionsandentanglements.com/?p=116</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop: Bloomer Making Workshop 2</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8EB58308-EB77-44E5-85B8-F07BCD8CDDF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This all day Bloomer Making Workshop was targeted at the general public and held at a popular cycling cafe and workshop - Look Mum No Hands. 12 people signed up within 12hours - and the waiting list was also full within the day!

People sent photos of finished garments weeks later and some talked about how it triggered either a renewed interest in sewing or introduced them to a brand new skill. The collaborative experience of sewing and talking about the research proved to be (as before in Bloomer Making Workshop 1) a very productive and generative method.

Increased social media around the workshop - twitter, facebook and eventbrite. Generated interest and grew the public presence of the project.
I was invited to run more of these events in public contexts - Feminism in London 2014 conference (Oct 25), London Bike Kitchen (Nov 24).

The impact of the research is evidenced through many invitations to speak, demonstrate research findings and run workshops. Examples include: Science Museum 'Late' which was themed 'Wearable Technology', V&amp;amp;A Design Culture Salon &amp;quot;How is the urban cyclist designed?&amp;quot;, Feminism in London annual conference workshop called 'Cycling, Sewing and Suffragette storytelling', London Bike Kitchen Women &amp;amp; Gender variant night 'Show, Tell &amp;amp; Try-on' event, London Cycle Campaign's 15th Policy Forum Seminar series on 'Latest Cycling Research', Somerset House's film screening and panel discussion on the representation of women in STEM industries and the Warsaw Design Practitioner Collective's Conference on mobility and design. The findings have been used to run public sewing workshops and try-on events where people engage with the project by literally getting into it. These workshops have proved popular with some events filling up within 12 hours. We have also presented the research in a public exhibition at a central London bike shop/caf&amp;eacute; and organised a public bike ride (in costume) around key London textiles, patent, feminist and cycling landmarks.
 
The project contributed to and benefited from an increase in media interest in the history of cycling and feminism. The PI was invited on the BBCs Great British Sewing Bee (approx. 2.5m viewers) to talk about the role of the bicycle, emancipation and women's active dress. The research has been referenced in the Guardian (Abrahams June 2015) about how the bicycle has been a creative tool for women's liberation throughout the last century. The article was only recently published and has already been shared 1928 times. 

In response to requests the research team are launching 10 digital sewing pattern packs inspired by costumes made in the project from patents lodged by Victorian women cyclists. The patterns showcase the research findings and provide instructions for people to replicate and adapt these inventive designs. The packs have Creative Commons licenses and will be available for free download on the project website.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D3103FC5-DE98-41AB-823B-464651F746CD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the project to explore representations of knowledge from new perspectives - namely the possibilities of new technologies and the making, curating and representing practices of other disciplines - was achieved. It did this in three key ways:

1. Generated an international network. A series of events were designed to explore, critique and foster knowledge exchange between a range of industry, creative and academic communities engaged in diverse creative practice. We explored questions - What is invention? What is practice? Are we engaging as practitioners in knowledge making or in world making? How do we keep bodies and materiality IN the exchange and circulation of knowledge? Discovered that these questions and challenges are central across disciplines and discussion provided insights into individual practice. One participant said the event made her 'feel at home instead of always having to defend a practice'. Members have begun to collaborate. The network continues to develop in 2015. 

2. Put findings into practice. New research project 'Freedom of Movement' (known as Bikes &amp;amp; Bloomers) brought to life insights emerging in the network. Involved collaborations with a weaver, pattern cutter and illustrator and resulted in the production of 5 Victorian cycling garments made from UK patents (total of 29 articles of clothing). All garments hand-made by the research team. We reflexively explored sociology-in-the-making; an explicit research engagement in the process of making, curating and circulating ideas across different disciplines and found new ways (as well as parallel ways) of articulating our work. Foe example, conversations with the tailor explored ideas around translations of ideas in multi-dimensions from 1D drawings - 3D toiles - 2D patterns and back again. The artist worked with the research team to visualise the research process and emerging findings. Resulting artworks were digitally printed onto silk and sewn into finished garments. The research team perform in the garments to present the research which has been greeted with enthusiasm by audiences in UK, Australia and US (so far). The garments operate as dynamic multi-dimensional sociological arguments and platforms for discussion and debate about different working practices

3. Participated in diverse range of public engagement activities. The project gained more exposure than anticipated in non-academic contexts. The research team has given public talks, performed in costume, run workshops, curated expert panels, facilitated sewing workshops, hosted an exhibition, published a website/blog and videos and curated cycle rides in art, design, science, cycling policy, transport, sewing, craftivism and activist oriented events. We have been invited to take the project on tour to the US and Australia. The sewing workshops are a particular noteworthy experimental and sensory research method that didn't just study patents but put them to work. People responded very positively to being invited 'into' the research, gaining day-long intensive exposure to the project and the embodied experience of making and wearing garments. The next step, in response to popular demand: 1. To launch Open Source Pattern PDFs and 2. Explore the commercial potential of the project.
The project successfully illustrated how far from operating as a point of closure, experimental methods of knowledge exchange mediate new conversations and offer new entry points into social science research for non-academic communities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- Sewing and Cycling intersections: Throughout the project, people have requested copies of the patterns produced in the research project. 'Downloadable Open Source PDF Pattern Packs' enable individuals to make their own versions of the convertible cycling garments. The sewing workshops were very successful and we have had many requests to run more events. We are exploring the potential of doing this with local bicycle communities. A 'Bloomer Making Workshop' information pack enables individuals to host their own events. We have also had requests to purchase finished garments and illustrated silks produced in collaboration with the artist, Alice Angus. We are exploring the commercial aspect of the project 

- Media coverage. Invitations to be involved in a radio program, print media and Wikipedia to submit inventive women's stories.

- New experimental research methods. The research team has given many talks about sewing and wearing of research as sociological methods and the use of time-lapse video in ethnographic study. Researchers seem interested in exploring these techniques in their own practice.
