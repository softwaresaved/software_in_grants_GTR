Given that Restoration productions of Shakespeare integrated drama and music, the project will be jointly led by a theatre scholar specializing in the history of Shakespeare on the stage and a musicologist specializing in theatre music from the 17th and 18th centuries. Research and public engagement will be run in partnership with The Folger Shakespeare Library (Washington, DC), Shakespeare's Globe (London) and The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (Stratford), the world's leading institutions dedicated to academic and public understanding of Shakespeare.

Context. When London theatres reopened in 1660 upon the restoration of the monarchy, few new plays were available. Logically, the patent companies staged works by Shakespeare and his contemporaries. But they did not perform Shakespeare's plays the way that the dramatist's company had done. Women played women's roles in the Restoration. The new indoor theatres were equipped with moveable scenery. Song, music and dance featured more prominently. With few exceptions, the plays were rewritten: King Lear survived; the witches in Macbeth sang and danced; Miranda in The Tempest had a sister.

Most scholarship in this area focuses narrowly on textual adaptation, ignoring the fact that Restoration Shakespeare was a complex theatrical experience that integrated song, music, dance and acting. We will correct this imbalance in knowledge by focusing on the performance dimensions of Restoration Shakespeare. We will sustain that focus by creating a community of scholars and artists, who together will undertake archival study, run studio-based workshops and create public performances of Restoration Shakespeare. In so doing, we will build upon the results of the Folger pilot project we recently led.

Objectives and Public Benefit. Our project seeks to enhance academic, artistic and public understanding of Restoration Shakespeare. Academics and artists will collaborate in research-led creative practice that results in scholarly publication and public performances. Academics will create new methods for investigating historical performances. Artists and arts organizations will expand their repertoires by performing Restoration Shakespeare. The general public will gain a better understanding of how Shakespeare's plays have been staged in different ways at different times. We will achieve these wide-ranging objectives through our research and public engagement events:

2017: Workshop on 'The Tempest' at the Globe, involving scholars, artists and the public. 

2018: Scholar-artist workshop on 'Macbeth' at the Folger, culminating in a professional production. The production will be recorded and the creative process will be documented in videos, all accessible to the public. The Folger will strongly invest in the project, making a direct contribution of &amp;pound;258,000 and an indirect contribution of &amp;pound;26,000.

2019: Restoration Shakespeare summer school at The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, with participants from UK theatre and music organizations. Parallel outreach will be conducted in the USA with the Folger and Early Music America.

Performing Restoration Shakespeare offers a compelling opportunity to build upon distinctive research in theatre history and musicology to generate new insights into Shakespeare's theatrical afterlife. The project promises to set a new agenda in performing arts research by creative innovative practice-based methods for studying historical performances. More widely, we will engage audiences and build capacity in arts organizations internationally by creating public events and documentary resources. Performing Restoration Shakespeare will make transformative and lasting contributions to knowledge within and beyond academia.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Performing Restoration Shakespeare will generate widespread cultural and economic impact through collaboration with the Folger Shakespeare Library, Shakespeare's Globe and The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Leveraging the global prominence of our partners, we will share research outcomes with 2,000,000+ people during the project life cycle. Additionally, the project has potential to deliver lasting cultural and economic impact through targeted stakeholder capacity building and public outreach. Non-academic beneficiaries are (1) theatre/music organizations, (2) performing artists and (3) the general public. Our research and impact activities are designed to evolve in tandem, each strengthening the other.

1. We will benefit theatre and music organizations by demonstrating to them the value of (i) performing Restoration Shakespeare for audiences today and (ii) embedding scholars in the full creative process. Immediate impact will be via scholar-artist workshops on Macbeth culminating in a production at the Folger Theatre. Thus, our research is already shaping the artistic profile of a major classical theatre by virtue of the Folger's decision to produce Restoration Macbeth. More broadly, the production enables the Folger to fulfill its own mission. As its Director of Public Programs affirms: 'To explore Macbeth and its performance history in a collaborative way presents possibilities for other Folger projects. Presenting Restoration Macbeth to audiences makes our collection more available for public understanding and appreciation'. To achieve similar impact on a wider scale, the Restoration Shakespeare summer school will introduce UK theatre/music organizations to a new repertoire and new methods for staging historical works. Outreach to parallel US organization will be undertaken through the Folger and Early Music America. Our goal is to influence arts programming in the long term by building institutional capacity for performing Restoration Shakespeare and for maximizing scholar-artist collaboration. Success will be evidenced by widespread and lasting changes in season planning and creative practice.

2. We will benefit individual artists in three ways: (i) sharing with them our research findings on Restoration Shakespeare; (ii) expanding their repertoire by performing Restoration versions of The Tempest and Macbeth with them; (iii) enhancing their creative process by involving them in scholar-artist collaboration. These benefits will initially be realised through events at the Globe (The Tempest, 2017) and the Folger (Macbeth, 2018). To extend that impact we will collaborate with theatre and music organizations in the summer school and through professional networks (see above), so that institutional changes will cascade down to individuals. Our pilot project confirmed the benefits that our research can deliver to individual artists. As the Folger Theatre's Artistic Director observed, 'Developing a production in a richly different way--with regular and in-depth input from scholars--was an extraordinary experience for individual artists'.

3. We will benefit the general public by enhancing their understanding of Shakespeare's afterlife. Our partners confirm that audiences are unfamiliar with Restoration Shakespeare but are eager to learn about it. We will redress that imbalance by engaging the public in our research via open workshops, public performances, live video recording (Folger-funded), documentaries, and audience enrichment materials distributed via partner organizations to 2,000,000+ people. These outcomes will be realised during the project. To secure lasting public benefit, the recording and video documentaries will be freely accessible to the public beyond the project timeframe. Audience enrichment materials will likewise outlive the project and be a lasting resource for performing arts groups internationally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>607311</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P004792/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>120E89AC-386D-4E25-9417-A3FE4D6FE83A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BBE419C-DE2B-46C8-8935-A1B633C83A8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
