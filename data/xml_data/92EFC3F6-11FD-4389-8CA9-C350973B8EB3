Throughout history, ideas about the healthy self as an active self have varied, yet contemporarily, such notions have acquired unprecedented currency: for example, active aging, active recovery, campaigns such as the ?Active Five a Day?, or the shifting conceptualisation of patients as active partners in healthcare. Two aspects of such discourse are&amp;nbsp;energy&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;desire&amp;nbsp;(wanting to get better and working hard to do so). Yet such discourses present paradoxes: how might active recoveries be imagined in conditions in which depletions to energy or desire are at the forefront of illness experience? What are the paradoxes of needing to want recovery when lack of desire is the condition itself?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Through rigorous historical-philosophical analysis and on-the-ground participatory research with individuals living with energy-related health conditions, this project will address the nuances of human energy, taking the conditions depression and chronic fatigue as examples. The project will constitute the first sustained study of human energy in illness and recovery with the aim of providing a uniquely multivocal and critically informed understanding of contemporary active agendas in health and social policy.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of this research include individuals living with chronic health conditions that affect their experiences of energy/ motivation/ stamina and a wider audience including health professionals, policy-makers and the general public. 

The primary beneficiaries of this research are individuals living with energy-related conditions (including chronic fatigue syndrome and mood disorders such as depression) and the organisations representing them. Energy-related conditions such as depression and chronic fatigue syndrome are relevant to the nation's health and wellbeing because they are (i) common and increasingly diagnosed, (ii) contentious and often poorly understood by health professionals, the general public and the media, and (iii) the frequent targets of policies seeking to reduce welfare dependency and encourage economic activity and active recoveries among the chronically ill. Previous research, including a pilot for this project, has found two particular concerns of service-users to be 'finding the words to describe' the affective and embodied experiences of energy associated with such illnesses and 'getting people [to include doctors, therapists, employers and families] to listen' to their particular difficulties with energy. With regard to these concerns, this research will work in partnership with service-users to:

1) Build a set of tools (including a documentary film and a prototype peer-to-peer training programme which could be 'rolled out' to a wider population) to support users in reflecting upon and managing their energy and increasing capacity for empowered communication of such energy needs to others. 
2) Build an in-depth knowledge base about the firsthand experience of living with an energy-related disorder which will form the basis for publications and presentations to professional audiences, including doctors, therapists, and policy-makers with an aim of increasing sensitivity to user experiences.
3) Explore the potential of the visual and performing arts to act as a vehicle for generating positive energy among those with chronic health conditions and/or as a means of empowering service-users to communicate complex affective and embodied illness experiences.

The above impact goals will also be achieved via engagement with clinicians, therapists and healthcare planners/providers in the form of an inter-professional workshop at the final art exhibition with the aims of (i) increasing awareness of and sensitivity to the energy-related concerns of patients, including those with depression and chronic fatigue syndrome, and (ii) encouraging opportunities for professional reflection and critical thinking about the notion of 'active recoveries' and how such rhetorics may produce contradictions in care both for those with specific energy-related conditions and in patient care more broadly. Promoting the film as a teaching resource for medical schools and counselling training institutes will be another means through which to actualise such outcomes. 

Wider beneficiaries of the research can be seen to stretch to the general public. Whilst this project works explicitly with particular clinical populations, human energy and managing one's energy affects the general population also and questions of energy-draining and energy-renewing activities are the topics of popular psychology, the media, and everyday human interactions alike. It is realistic to suggest that the public engagement/outreach elements of this research (e.g. the public art exhibition) will have potential to prompt debate, self-reflection and even behaviour change among attendees. By pioneering new modes of working between academics and non-academics and in establishing a leader in the field of service-user-led/participatory research, the project also has long-range potential for impact in developing universities of the future which have the capacity and motivation to place engaged and involved research at the heart of their agendas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>171354</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has so far been successful in exploring a range of issues associated with the different ways in which individuals conceptualise, cope with, manage and regulate their human energies through a range of life events and circumstances from endurance sports to long term illness.
