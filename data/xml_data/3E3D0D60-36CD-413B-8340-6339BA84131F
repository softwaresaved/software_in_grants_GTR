Crucially though, the series will also include ecological and conservation practitioners, environmental and wildlife law enforcement, and other experts. This core group of approximately 15 people will meet to exchange professional and academic knowledge and expertise, practical information, and research plans, which will further the state of Green Crime knowledge and lead to interdisciplinary research projects. The series includes five half-day seminars and one 2-day mini-conference. The series will focus primarily on:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Green Criminology Theories and Concepts&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Wildlife and Timber Trafficking&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Animal Abuse and Wildlife Crime&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Hazardous Waste and Pollution&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Environmental Law and Regulation. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The mini-conference will have sessions on each of these themes and those aspects of Green Criminology not covered elsewhere, such as methodological challenges, environmental conflict, and bio-piracy. The mini-conference will also have a session devoted to plans for future collaborative research, publications, and an annual conference. The series will have wide international dissemination because it will be webcast through a dedicated website and advertised using the Green Criminology list serve.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Established, early and new career academics from multiple disciplines will certainly benefit from this seminar series. This will not only be those that are already engaged with the field of Green Criminology, but other criminologists and interdisciplinary researchers will also be exposed to the theoretical and conceptual breadth that Green Criminology now encompasses. This could potentially inspire others to join the field. Furthermore undergraduate and postgraduate students will benefit from this series. Some postgraduates will be core group members of the seminar series and other postgraduates and undergraduates will be able to watch the seminar series online. This will expose them to the cutting edge research of Green Criminologists which is typically left out of university courses with a few notable exceptions. This could be their only engagement with an important field that is growing. To these academic beneficiaries (contributors, attendees, and virtual participants) of the seminar series, the major benefit is the first ever series that is devoted exclusively to the topic of Green Crime. This will enable in depth discussions and engagement with the many different aspects of Green Crime that typically get overlooked or glossed over in other venues. It will positively impact all those in the field of Green Criminology because this seminar series will firmly establish a mechanism for networking that will undoubtedly lead to new collaborations and research projects that will contribute to the theoretical, empirical, methodological, and conceptual understanding of the variety of Green Crimes. This will particularly impact the student participants (though the academics will also benefit) because their studies and careers will begin with an already established and solid network. This will enable them to draw knowledge from this foundation and to form research collaborations more easily than is currently possible.
These collaborations and future research projects will not just be amongst academics, but will include the range of seminar series practitioner participants, who will also widen their networks. In the long-term, such research could improve the policies and practices of the ecological, conservation, and law enforcement organisations that engage (directly or virtually) in the seminar series, both within the UK and internationally. The series will ensure that current academic thinking and debate is brought into a dialogue with the 'action contexts' of these practitioners (ecologists, conservationists, law enforcement, NGOS, campaigners, and policy makers), benefiting them, but also ensuring reciprocation by sharing practitioner knowledge and expertise with the academic beneficiaries. The Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime, comprising representatives of the agencies involved in UK wildlife law enforcement and which sets wildlife crime priorities, which has been invited to take part, is one such practitioner that will benefit from this series. Third sector organisations such as TRAFFIC, WWF, and the Environmental Investigation Agency will also benefit from this series and its assessment of relevant theory, policy, and practice. The dissemination stage will share seminar outcomes and publications with bodies including the Environmental Law Foundation, Environmental Justice Foundation, and the UK Environmental Law Association. Additionally, the Law Commission's review of wildlife law will directly be affected by this series as potentially will any future reviews of environmental law. At the same time, the academics and practitioners involved in the series will gain insights into practical, jurisprudential, and political aspects of the law-making process through the Law Commission's input into seminars.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18022</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1801</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Brown Crime: Hazardous Waste and Pollution</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Northumbria</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>FA3A6492-6675-47FC-83C0-657F9BB493AA</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>It is difficult to gauge how the 'findings' have been used as a seminar series contains numerous presentations from a variety of independent research projects as well as theoretical and conceptual discussions. We do know that collaborations for further empirical research projects were generated from the series. This is seen in a Strategic Network bid as well as a bid to continue this series. The second seminar on wildlife and timber trafficking helped to inform the FP7 EFFACE project by establishing ties to undertake the case studies conducted for that research. The third seminar informed the Law Commission's ongoing review of wildlife legislation. A presentation about Ozone depleting substances from the fourth seminar on Hazardous Waste was repeated to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. One of the presentations from the final conference about how to uncover illegal ivory on the Internet has been turned into a concept note for the Wildlife Crime Technology Challenge that will fund promising technology to help prevent wildlife trafficking.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A6779F6D-D683-4ED7-A833-04CE16438C0A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We met our aim of increasing our green criminology network as is evident by the 70+ people from 20 countries that attended the final seminar in London. Each seminar had at least 30 people - undergraduates, postgraduates, early career researchers, established academics and practitioners. Our Youtube channel has received nearly 1,700 views and will be transferred to the 'greencriminology.org' website that is supported and maintained by its members and sustainable in the long term.
There will be numerous events springboarding from the seminar series. Applications are being submitted to the Higher Education Innovation Fund for impact, to the Socio-legal Studies Association seminar fund and the Modern Law Review seminar fund. A second seminar series bid is also planned to expand our network to the wider UK, Europe and in particular to increase participation of students and practitioners.
Collaborative bids from partnerships made during the series are also beginning to take place, such as for the AHRC Transformations Scheme.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are already of interest to intra-governmental agencies. Professor Lorraine Elliott who spoke at the 4th seminar was asked after her presentation to speak about her research to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime. We expect that other research presented will also be picked up by policy makers and other academics. This should increase as the publications from the series are more widely available.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>56478E0A-2FAC-4B8E-860A-9149C1004157</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and
