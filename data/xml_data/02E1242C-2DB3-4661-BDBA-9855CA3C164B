The farmers are resource poor and have a range of problems with which to contend, in particular the loss of yield due to damage by insect pests (stem-borers) and parasitic weeds (striga). The insect stem-borers are the caterpillars of indigenous and introduced moths, and attack maize stems causing extensive damage and even the loss of the plant by collapse. During the course of work on controlling insect pests, by intercropping with repellent plants and trap cropping with plants that attract the adult moths away from the maize, an intercrop was found that provided dramatic control of striga. These parasitic weeds from the Striga genus are in the snapdragon family and are a major threat to the staple food crops of over 100 million people in the region. The striga-controlling intercrops were cattle forage legumes, commonly called desmodium, and when grown on-farm as a one-to-one intercrop between maize and other subsistence cereals such as sorghum, the parasitic striga was controlled to the extent that a yield of well under 1 tonne/hectare of maize could be raised to over 5 tonnes/hectare. To show this protection was based on chemicals generated from the root system of desmodium, it was demonstrated that the effect could be provided by passing water over the roots of desmodium and then into soil containing the striga and maize seeds. Furthermore, when desmodium was grown in water with nutrients but without soil (hydroponically), the water captured the activity, which could then be transferred to the striga and maize seeds in soil, and again conferred control of the parasite. The chemical composition from the water effecting this control has been studied and fractions of the content separated from each other. After the striga seed germinates, a radicle (root) is produced that will develop into the attachment organ for parasitism of maize. However, one particular fraction causes interference with the development of the radicle and from this we have identified a potent radicle inhibitor. The structure of this compound is a di-C-glycosylflavone called isoschaftoside. Many plants possess the ability to produce flavones, however the glycosylation steps required to produce isoschaftoside are unusual. We propose to identify the enzyme in desmodium that performs this glycosylation by searching for C-glycosyltransferase activity on substrates in the biosynthetic pathway in protein extracts of root tissue. We will purify the protein by following this activity using standard protein purification techniques and characterise its structure by determining its amino acid sequence. This sequence will allow us to search the genomes of edible crop legumes in an effort to find this protein and so breed edible crop legumes that, when intercropped, also prevent striga from parastising maize. In addition, the desmodium gene itself, which generates the C-glycosyltransferase protein in the plant, provides a target for genetic modification of an edible crop legume that will prevent striga parasitizing maize. This work will provide the first elucidation of how a valuable weed suppression mechanism can be utilised and could provide the basis for attempts to control weeds in agriculture in other developing countries and potentially also in developed countries, such as the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Desmodium uncinatum, when intercropped with maize and other cereals in soil with a high level of seeds of the parasite Striga hermonthica (Scrophulariaceae), gives yield increases of 5-fold and when repeatedly used, helps to reduce the Striga seed bank. Activity has been demonstrated to be in both root exudate and extracts of D. uncinatum and acts without the need for soil or rhizobial inoculation. Such suppressive activity is not present in the root exudates of other commonly used intercrops such as cowpea, beans, soybean. Bioassay-guided fractionation of D. uncinatum root exudate, from hydroponic culture, or extract has identified, by NMR spectroscopy, lipophilic components conferring high germination of the Striga seed and hydrophilic components that cause inhibition of the rate of elongation of the Striga radicle. The main inhibitory compound identified is an unusual di-C-linked glycoside of a flavonoid. D. uncinatum is a legume that can be used as cattle forage but edible crop legumes, such as cowpea, do not show this protection mechanism despite possessing the biosynthetic pathway to flavones. The ability to biosynthesise the active component requires this glycosylation process. We propose to isolate the C-glycosyltransferase (CGT) responsible for biosynthesising the active component from D. uncinatum and using amino acid sequence data, search for genes in sequenced legumes, in particular cowpea, that confer the same biosynthetic transformation. This provides a basis for breeding the protection pathway into an edible crop legume. In addition, the C-glycosyltransferase gene will be a target for genetic modification of cowpea to produce an edible legume intercrop that possesses the Striga protection mechanism.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>619116</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on organic chemistry and mass spectrometry</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BE28BE8A-A095-46EF-BB6B-EF06BB662E15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop to train 20 Anglophone PhD students from 6 African countries was held in Nairobi at the icipe, Duduville campus.

The biosynthesis requires a C-glucosyltransferase which was purified to high activity. Amino acid sequences were obtained from candidate proteins but none matched the expected conserved region of the desired enzyme.



A characterised C-glucosyltransferase (OsCGT) and flavanone 2-hydroxylase (CYP93G2) from rice were used to transform the bacterium A. rhizogenes, which subsequently was used to create a chimeric cowpea plant with roots transformed to possess the biosynthetic enzymes. While the enzyme function was present, the desired metabolites were not as the substrates were not observed in the transformed hairy root.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Intercropping with desmodium to combat striga is exploited by over 50 000 resource-poor farmers. The discoveries within the project provide a quality assurance for the intercropping plants to ensure they possess the biochemistry as is required. The chemical and genetic basis for striga-inhibiting activity has been identified in other desmodium species which have different growth habits and suitability for different agronomic conditions and these may be incorporated into alternative striga management practices.



The biosynthetic pathway for C-glycosylflavones may be introduced into whole cowpea (or other plant species) as the substrates are present in shoot and leaf tissue. The products may then be transported to the roots and the rhizosphere.



C-glycosylflavones of various structures have been reported to inhibit insect herbivory, protect against infections in plants and promote association with beneficial soil microorganisms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The basis for their production in planta provides a mechanism for investigating these chemical ecological interactions for crop plants.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>65E7DFDB-D1B7-4A7C-9FC7-00EE864CDE71</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture/ Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.push-pull.net/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/63CA8D39-9000-4338-9448-7BCCEE5DBCC2"><gtr:id>63CA8D39-9000-4338-9448-7BCCEE5DBCC2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Companion cropping to manage parasitic plants.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annual review of phytopathology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ac3d790fb912b51a108266f14f17c08b"><gtr:id>ac3d790fb912b51a108266f14f17c08b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pickett JA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0066-4286</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D5FE0317-DD8E-41D9-9678-FEE10B0F9442"><gtr:id>D5FE0317-DD8E-41D9-9678-FEE10B0F9442</gtr:id><gtr:title>Elucidation of the biosynthesis of the di-C-glycosylflavone isoschaftoside, an allelopathic component from Desmodium spp. that inhibits Striga spp. development.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Phytochemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7f354c2aa374ae552f86511a54e626ac"><gtr:id>7f354c2aa374ae552f86511a54e626ac</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hamilton ML</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9422</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/746CAB19-FF0E-4DBC-94FD-6AB5C0BF9032"><gtr:id>746CAB19-FF0E-4DBC-94FD-6AB5C0BF9032</gtr:id><gtr:title>Biosynthesis of natural and novel C-glycosylflavones utilising recombinant Oryza sativa C-glycosyltransferase (OsCGT) and Desmodium incanum root proteins.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Phytochemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/707a0dc1eccfebc741dc443bfdeb53fe"><gtr:id>707a0dc1eccfebc741dc443bfdeb53fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hao B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9422</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BE0AD785-6AE2-49D3-9B4B-2AE5DB3902F0"><gtr:id>BE0AD785-6AE2-49D3-9B4B-2AE5DB3902F0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Isoschaftoside, a C-glycosylflavonoid from Desmodium uncinatum root exudate, is an allelochemical against the development of Striga.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Phytochemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8d899bcf717a168428091de00df40442"><gtr:id>8d899bcf717a168428091de00df40442</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hooper AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9422</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0FF6C8E3-64C8-4F15-A536-E3FE3B4E566F"><gtr:id>0FF6C8E3-64C8-4F15-A536-E3FE3B4E566F</gtr:id><gtr:title>C-Glucosylflavonoid biosynthesis from 2-hydroxynaringenin by Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.)
