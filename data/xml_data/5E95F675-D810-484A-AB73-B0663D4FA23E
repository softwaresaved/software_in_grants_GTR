Statistics highlight the capacity of the oceans to produce wild harvests are nearing a sustainable limit. Within this context, certification and ecolabelling of seafood has become a popular means to inform consumers of the quality of a product. Consumers are increasingly requesting assurance that marine resources are being managed in a sustainable manner, above and beyond assurances from government. Over the last 10 years these approaches have grown in scope and have become increasingly visible with several key fisheries becoming certified as 'sustainable'. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research aims to unravel some of the key questions surrounding the ecolabelling process. The first phase of the research examines organisations that certify fisheries or aquaculture and investigates their processes of certification. The second phase explores the market effectiveness of selected eco-labels. Do they influence consumers? The final phase examines whether improvements to management have occurred within certified operations as a result of the process. This project is innovative as it looks at fisheries and aquaculture certification systems together and investigates the fundamental questions surrounding the effectiveness of ecolabelling as market based environmental policy tools.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98590</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Marine Stewardship Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Marine Stewardship Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>93B75E0C-1BEB-4381-AF4E-B99EC0ACB010</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contribution to new proposals (H2020 Marie Curie Training Network)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>MSC hosted myself for several weeks across a range of locations e.g. Head Office in London, Regional Offices in Scotland and USA.

Ocean fisheries and aquaculture, either directly or indirectly, are an important source of work and income for millions of people - the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has estimated that 43 million people depend on fisheries and aquaculture for employment (FAO 2009). The socio-economic importance of the seafood sector, coupled with the ecological value of marine life, highlight the need for effective management to ensure healthy marine environments and coastal communities.

But something is wrong. Globally, nationally and regionally marine environments are increasingly at risk. In Scotland we have decades of overfishing the resource and cycles of 'boom and bust'. This pattern is repeated, and entrenched, by ineffective systems of centralised control and management. Enter Eco-labelling: a flexible system of using markets and consumer pressure to drive positive changes in fishing and aquaculture practices. Eco-labelling, now 10 years old, is reportedly a new force in turning around the self destructive tendency of the industry by creating incentives for sustainable harvesting. How does it work? Who are the players? How does it mesh with existing management? Is it effective? These issues will be discussed in this seminar that touches on the challenge of ensuring sustainable seafood for society and restoring healthy marine ecosystems.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.aces.ac.uk/documents/TavisPottsseminar.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings have been used in a variety of public workshops, seafood events, blogs and social media outputs.

This study explores the implementation of fisheries and aquaculture sustainability standards, the organisations behind the standards, and the application of product ecolabels in the context of environmental policy.

The research described the structure and operations of eco labelling (CEOs) organisations. The results revealed the inner workings of CEOs and the divergent views on standards and sustainability, on organisational structures and processes, transparency, financial models, and engagement. While visions of organisations were similar i.e. achieving sustainable resource use, the means of achieving the vision were diverse. There was often tension within the organisaiton concerning standard development increasingly competitive relationships between the different CEOs for market share.
The study interviewed consumers and producers over their views and practices concerning certification and eco-labelling. Consumers, while indicating a general preference towards sustainable production, displayed a considerable lack of recognition of the key certification schemes, and were particularly critical of the idea of organic aquaculture. Considering that 80% of seafood is sold in high street chains, this is an area of particular concern and improvement. In terms of industry, we focused on the outcomes of involvement in the Marine Stewardship Council program in Scottish fisheries. Positive views were received about the credibility of the process, but concerns emerged over access, cost, and the squeezing of small scale fisheries in preference to larger scale operators. 

Scientific impacts include:
1. The research has filled a niche in the literature: that of examining in detail the practices and operations of the key CEOs and linking this to a consumer survey and industry interview. Most approaches to date in the primary and secondary literature do not delve deeper into the practices, structures, and values of
organisations. Many studies have been unsuitably quantitative in this regard and have not captured the complexity of process behind organisational structures and processes, standard development, verification, licensing arrangements, and
relationships to broader stakeholders and systems of governance.
2. A novel contribution has been to examine seafood products and processes across all sectors - as they would appear to consumers 'on the shelf'. Most analysis has proceeded in sectoral compartments and not integrated across the
seafood industry as a whole. For example the certification and eco-labelling
generic model covers both fisheries and aquaculture and will provide a useful focus for developing scientific and socio-economic outputs.
3. Understanding the commercial sector's view, including individual fishermen, has
been poorly covered in the literature. EECSAF contributes to this perspective that will be academically and socio-economically useful for improving programs.
4. The development of a mixed methods approach, using qualitative case studies,
interviews and a survey has been a novel contribution of the research.
5. The creation of a significant data base of interviews (over 130,000 words),
corporate documents, financial information and management processes of each
organisation is a key resource for future research. In addition the data and instruments from the surveys will support future research effort.
6. The outputs to date have been presented at 2 international conferences in Norway (Aquaculture Economics 2008) and Greece (International Congress of
Social Sciences 2009). In addition the outputs have used for teaching material in undergraduate and PGT courses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Future research plans:

Currently, the focus, for example of IDH, is on 18 commodities. Starting point are the targets, such as
poverty reduction or environmental protection. Deforestation has been, and still is, a major theme,
crosscutting different commodities. Some sectors have more impacts than others, some sectors can
deliver more gains. It is expected that biggest gains are to be found in cocoa, tea, pulp &amp;amp; paper, palm oil
and soy, and not in natural stone for example. Focus can enhance credibility, because chain actors
ranging from producers to consumers, need proof that a sector can be transformed. Focus is also needed
to be able to move towards and reach tipping points. It could be a task of governments to bring focus.
However, given the strong diversity of chains and commodities, it was debated whether focus is the
right means to reach overall sustainability. The diversity of perspectives was mentioned as an important
prerequisite in sustainable GVC governance, because focus could lead to tunnel vision. There was
however no support to, for example, double the amount of commodities to be addressed by standards,
though neither was there for the common notion that there is now overcertification. Especially if
spillover effects are real, overcertification is not a problem. It was noted that there is no overcertification,
but there is overassessment. The issue of premium eroding was addressed, especially if the aim is to let
producers gain from standards. What would be the incentive for small-scale producers to invest and
participate, if there is no premium? The business case is essential for producers. It was argued that there
can be other effects more important than direct economic impact, like through capacity building and
improved farming. Also, &amp;quot;old-fashioned aid&amp;quot; is still a way to improve farming without certification. It
was suggested that focus is not the right word, but that it is about prioritization.

2. What instruments are sufficient, is there a need for more instruments, and/or should there
be a mix of instruments?
Certification can be the trigger for innovation and improvement. It should be realized though that
certification is not just one-size-fits-all, there is a plurality of models, structures and forms. How to make
sure that sustainability standards become sustainable themselves is a challenge; it was noted that we are
still in the startup phase. Public money is especially needed in the initial phase but since sustainability
is about continual improvement, developing an exit strategy (after 2-4 years) for government support is
of utmost importance. Private partners should take it further, and make the B2B relations work.
Certification can facilitate such B2B collaboration, by bringing people together, forging relationships
and building platforms for information exchange and local support.

3. What is the relation between standards or structures on the national level, and those on
the international level, is there a need for benchmarking?
Overall, there was consensus that there is a need for benchmarking of national standards, although it
was noted that retailers work globally, so they do not support the idea of national standards.
Benchmarking can range from harmonization to equivalency, a question is what does benchmarking
need to do? According to some, it should be a spectrum and employ a stepwise approach towards
sustainability (continual improvement). Point of concern is credibility of national standards: how to
make sure that credibility principles are met or strengthened?</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.iob-evaluatie.nl/sites/iob-evaluatie.nl/files/Chains%20for%20Change%20workshop%20report.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Report cited in UN FAO Committee on Fisheries</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6E8352FF-0CFD-4B6A-9030-F2404237998A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research contibuted to a recent FAO study and policy update on ecoloballeing impacts. Recent ecolabel benchmarking exercises have shown a mixed use of the FAO Guidelines, but usage is expected to increase as interest in the governance implications of ecolabels grows. Through a focus on two certifiers/ecolabels for marine fisheries (Marine Stewardship Council and Global Trust's &amp;quot;FAO Based Responsible Fisheries Management Certification&amp;quot;) this report examines two issues facing ecolabelling community. A further consideration of one of the often-touted benefits of ecolabels - price premiums - has been conducted. A literature review revealed that no data on economic returns to fishers have been published thus far. The recent research done on price premiums at the retail level represent the first step required for tracing price premiums back to fishers. The FAO guidelines for ecolabelling offer resolutions for both issues explored under the context of MSC and Global Trust while the demonstrated potential for price premiums helps further support the potential benefits of ecolabels for fishers. Further refinements to the FAO Guidelines are suggested that would reduce the number of guidelines while increased outreach and dissemination of the Guidelines paired with a robust evaluation framework may improve understanding and therefore uptake.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.fao.org/3/a-bc431e.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Dataset of consumer responses to ecolabels and sustainable seafood.

farmed (60%). While a majority (60.5%) gave thought to the production processes
behind seafood, a further 67% indicated that a label that described the product as
'environmentally friendly' would influence purchase. Organic production was not
popular, 74% said an organic label on seafood would not influence a purchase. When
asked about the MSC label, surprisingly, 5% of consumers recognised the label, 12%
were vaguely aware, and 83% were unfamiliar. In contrast, the Fair trade logo, 40%
were very familiar and 44% somewhat familiar. While the survey delved deeper into
these trends, these responses highlight that eco-labelling has a challenge in reaching out
to the consumer. The public appears to be thinking about the impacts of fisheries, but
this is yet to translate into awareness and purchasing of eco-labelled products.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Dataset : consumer responses to ecolabelling</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/851666/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4079C8F3-E086-4CEF-A258-E0279849926D"><gtr:id>4079C8F3-E086-4CEF-A258-E0279849926D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Marine Resources Management</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/093e8215c3da841b9d47e475abdf75b7"><gtr:id>093e8215c3da841b9d47e475abdf75b7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gullett, Warwick</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780409327441</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-061-25-0034</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/F000448/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
