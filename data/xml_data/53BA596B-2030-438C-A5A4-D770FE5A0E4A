Resilience, adaptability, and transformability of fishing communities in the face of the World fisheries crisis</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J017825/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Today?s world fisheries crisis can be seen as one incidence of the increasing scarcity of natural resources experienced globally as a result of population growth, globalisation and increased consumption per capita, among other factors. In the case of fisheries, this situation is exacerbated by the increasing numbers of people who rely on fishing to maintain their livelihood and the use of more powerful and more efficient fishing equipment. As a consequence, there is a growing consensus that the overall fishing effort needs to be curbed significantly if the sustainability of the world fisheries is to be restored. However, how can policy reforms aimed at reducing fishing efforts be implemented without causing millions of resource-poor people to fall deeper into deprivation and food insecurity?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The overall aim of this project is to use the most recent progress in resilience thinking and wellbeing research to generate empirical qualitative and quantitative analyses and provide a policy-relevant answer to this question, thus aiming at reconciling inclusive growth with resource conservation. The project is built around 4 country case-studies: Sri Lanka and Vietnam in South Asia, Ghana in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Fiji in the Pacific region.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ultimate beneficiaries of this project are the men and women engaged in small-scale fisheries and related formal and informal activities (fish trading and processing). This accounts for more than 117 million people in the developing world, who are increasingly affected by the world fisheries crisis. In the medium term, the awareness and capacity of national and international policy-makers will be raised by the provision of science-based analysis guiding their decisions about the means and actions needed to address this global crisis and to reconcile inclusive growth with resource conservation. Beyond direct fish-dependent households, producers and other enterprises linked to the sector through economic multipliers will also benefit from improved resource stocks, enhanced productivity and entrepreneurship opportunities stemming from supportive inclusive growth policies. Longer term benefits will be on consumers' nutrition and welfare and society at large in the developing countries where small-scale fisheries are prevalent, through increased access to quality food, employment, value added and revenues generated by the higher contribution of these small-scale fisheries to the national economy. 

Another major group of beneficiaries are researchers of various horizons, ranging from fisheries economists and socio-anthropologists, to academics with wider interests in resilience and adaptation to change, the use of wellbeing as an analytical framework to understand individuals' decisions and behaviour, and the questions of the contribution of specific sectoral activities to inclusive growth. The publication of the project's findings in top international journals is expected to lead to the subsequent development and inclusion of new research questions and new analyses in the agenda of those scientific communities, within and beyond the direct area of influence of this project.

Ripple impacts are further expected and uptake of results and recommendations more widely disseminated through the involvement of the WorldFish Center. Being an international research organisation strongly linked to other global actors (FAO, World Bank, ADB), this organization will offer an additional global dimension to the project's results. Direct access to the research will enhance its pivotal role as policy-broker and strengthen the impact of its guidance internationally. In addition, close interactions will be developed with the newly launched initiative on Voluntary Guidelines on Securing Sustainable Small-scale Fisheries (FAO 2011) and the FAO's Global Programme to improve Fisheries and Aquaculture, which are shaping and supporting the fisheries agenda at the global level. 

The advisory involvement of the WorldFish Center will also ensure a strong connection with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and the national agricultural actors with which this group is linked. The project will also liaise and feed into strategic initiatives including the Global Program on Fisheries project supported jointly by the World Bank and FAO, and the new Regional Fisheries Program operating in West Africa and funded by the World Bank and USAID. In the Pacific, outputs from the project will complement the recent extensive review of fisheries policy and adaptation capacity that was implemented by the WorldFish Center and its partners and funded by the Asian Development Bank across five countries (PNG, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste, Vanuatu). 

Targeted outputs will be issued throughout the project to allow rapid dissemination of findings to key audiences: practitioners, professional stakeholders, and policy-makers via established networks and knowledge dissemination support (e.g. Eldis), and partners' national and international constituencies (e.g. the ICSF). Internally, interactive engagement with all partners will be maintained through support visits, workshops at key project stages and electronic consultations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>414267</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings of the ES/J017825/1 project &amp;quot;Tangled in their own (safety)-nets? Resilience, adaptability, and transformability of small-scale fishing communities in the face of the World fisheries crisis have been used so far essentially at the interface between research and intervention programming in the domain of food security, climate change adaptation and resilience. In particular some of the findings produced by the project had been instrumental in advancing the conceptualization and understanding of household and community resilience and how to better programme interventions that aim at strengthening people resilience (in the context of food security). Some of the ideas presented in the earlier working papers that were produced through the research have been used so far by several international development agencies such as UNDP, WFP or USAID in some of their recent framework on resilience, and have then 'trickled down' to many international NGOs involved in the implementations of resilience interventions in Africa and Asia.

Small events such as a delay in rainfall, individual illness, or more severe idiosyncratic or covariate shocks such as the death of the household head, consecutive harvest failures, or the devastating impact of seasonal tropical storms, can have irreversible consequences on people's lives, affecting their income, food security and health, and possibly driving them deeper into poverty. 
In this context the main achievement of this 3-year project is the deeper understanding of the resilience and resilience strategies that are put in place by the members of small-scale coastal fishing communities in developing countries to respond to shocks and stressors, and the implications that this could have in terms of policy at national level. Through the field-based research implemented in the four case study countries (Fiji, Ghana Sri-Lanka and Vietnam) the project was able to unpack and analyze the different factors and events/hazards which contribute to the vulnerability of fishing communities in these countries and to identify the different strategies that the members of these communities develop to face and respond to these shocks and stressors. 
Because it holds particular appeals to the idea of people being able to endure shocks and stressors and bounce back, resilience has emerged as a concept that could help academics and practitioners better understand the links between shocks, responses and development outcomes. Using this concept is not without challenges, however. Resilience has been recognized to be multi-scale, context and shock specific, and highly dynamic, characteristics that make it hard to measure through simple proxies. The second main achievement of this project was therefore the development of an operational framework that allowed us to probe and analyse the resilience of households to different shocks and stressors. The unit of analysis was the households and the analysis was based on psychometric measures i.e. self-reported indicators. As such the framework does not claim to provide an absolute measure of resilience but instead allow to compare levels of resilience of households exposed and affected by different types of adverse events and to capture some of the more subjective dimensions of these households' resilience. 
The results are obviously case-study (and country) specific. However some worth-noticing trends emerge beyond the idiosyncratic nature of the processes at work. Amongst the most noticeable is the fact that in the four countries the results of the analyses converge toward the same conclusion, which is that households are in a constant state of incomplete recovering. In other words, the mental model (shock -&amp;gt; response -&amp;gt; recovery) which is widely accepted in the resilience literature and in the humanitarian community is too simplistic, and possibly misleading, in that a state of (full) recovery may not exist: households (in the poor communities which we interviewed) do not seem to have the chance or the time to fully recover from one particular event before being affected by the next. In short, they spend their life trying to recover from the cumulative and continuous effect of shocks and stressors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project have no antecedent and are opening a totally new area of research, expanding in particular the frontier of our current understanding of what affect and influence the ability of households to respond adequately to adverse events. More research will be necessarily to confirm and test some of these key-findings in different contexts. In that regard the field-testing and demonstrated applicability of the framework and methods in the four countries included in the project suggest that both framework and methods can effectively be applied to various locations and situation, and as such could help exploring important new areas of research in relation to the social and subjective dimensions of resilience in different cultural and social environments and for different socio-economic groups.
In the specific context of small-scale fishing communities the project identifies key-factors which contribute to the unwillingness and/or inability of fisherfolk to leave the sector and as such provide empirical explanations about the current difficulties of fisheries managers to curve down the over-capacities of the word fisheries. The project's findings offer therefore some important and innovative avenues for policy makers and managers to address the global issue of the &amp;quot;world fisheries crisis&amp;quot;.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FC64B635-A68F-4A5A-8AA1-9AF7D505EFCC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7D19D06B-41E5-46B7-A156-51879F527185"><gtr:id>7D19D06B-41E5-46B7-A156-51879F527185</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards a Quantifiable Measure of Resilience</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/aedee1142d8d862565940f4180e08e25"><gtr:id>aedee1142d8d862565940f4180e08e25</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>B?n?
