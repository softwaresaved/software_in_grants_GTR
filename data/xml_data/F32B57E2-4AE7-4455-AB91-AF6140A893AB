The cells of our bodies use glucose as a source of energy for movement, growth, repair, and other functions. But before the cells can use glucose, it must move from the bloodstream into the individual cells. This process requires insulin. Insulin is a crucial metabolic hormone produced exclusively in the pancreatic beta-cells. Impaired beta-cell function leads to inadequate insulin output and as a result glucose stays in the bloodstream, causing a rise in the blood glucose level. The failure of beta-cells is ultimately responsible for the development of type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are deficient in insulin as well as being resistant to its action. This disease affects at least 2 million people in the UK - about 4 % of the population- and the numbers are still rising. It consumes 10 per cent of NHS expenditure, and is a major cause of illness and premature death. I am interested in the mechanisms by which beta-cells respond to changes in blood sugar concentration with release of insulin. In beta-cells insulin is carried in vesicles, membrane bound structures, of which there are thousands inside the cell. Once the beta-cell has been challenged with glucose, the vesicles are transported along tracks towards the cell surface. Here, the vesicle transiently fuses with the cell membrane and insulin is released from the cell. The mechanics of this transport and fusion event are one of the steps that go wrong in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the mechanisms that regulate the movement of these vesicles are fundamental component of insulin secretion. My recent studies have revealed that vesicles move along their tracks driven by molecular motor proteins. These proteins are essential for delivering vesicles to the site of release at the plasma membrane to maintain insulin secretion in the duration of elevated blood glucose level. Despite the clear role of motor proteins in insulin secretion, phenotypes that result from defects from their function have not been investigated in humans or in mice carrying natural mutations in these genes. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which vesicle movement immediately beneath the plasma membrane are regulated are also unclear. The proposed project aims to understand how the activity of one of the motor proteins, myosin Va, is regulated by glucose. I will investigate the insulin secretion profiles in the myosin Va mutant mice. I will identify molecules that interact with this motor protein or activate it by altering its properties. Furthermore, I will identify proteins which detect the cell's energy change and convert it into a signal for vesicle transport and fusion. This research proposal will advance our knowledge of the glucose sensing process of the pancreatic beta-cell and potentially contribute to the development of future treatment strategies of diabetes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The molecular mechanism by which changes in nutrient metabolism promote mobilisation and secretion of insulin containing large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) in pancreatic beta-cells is unclear. It is very likely that the orchestration of these cellular processes becomes defective in type 2 diabetes. While I have demonstrated that myosin Va-driven transport is involved in the recruitment of LDCVs to the plasma membrane, the molecular basis and regulation of this process is undefined. Furthermore, phenotypes that result from defects from myosin Va driven LDCV transport have not been investigated in mice carrying natural mutations in this gene. The proposed study is aimed to identify the components of the myosin Va-LDCV complex and explore the mechanisms whereby increases in glucose concentration might lead to the recruitment of myosin Va to LDCVs in pancreatic beta-cells. To investigate the role of Rab 27a as a potential myosin Va regulating protein, binding of myosin Va to LDCVs will be measured in Rab27 siRNA suppressed beta-cells using imaging and biochemical methods. To identify the LDCV-specific myosin Va receptor, pull-down experiments with the globular tail domain of myosin Va (GTD) or with the secretory vesicle-specific region of GTD will be used. Interacting partners will be identified by biochemical and proteomic approaches. To investigate the role of phosphorylation in myosin Va binding to LDCVs, specific peptide inhibitors and immunochemical analysis will be carried out. To investigate the secretory phenotype in myosin Va mutant mice, glucose and insulin tolerance tests will be performed. This integrated multidisciplinary project will reveal fundamental information on the molecular basis and regulation of insulin-granule mobilisation and secretion. Better understanding of the downstream targets of glucose-derived metabolic signals in beta-cell likely to contribute to the development of a novel, more targeted therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>292231</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We identified the secretory granule (SG)-specific adapter proteins that link MyoVa to this organelle. In addition, we also demonstrated a novel signalling pathway by which these complexes are activated by glucose and incretin hormones. These are the first SG-MyoVa protein complexes described to date and importantly, the same or similar complexes are universally used by neuronal, endocrine and neuroendocrine cells for SG transport. Thus, our findings have wider application for hormone and neuropeptide secretion.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Mechanisms underlying the amplifying pathway of fuel-induced insulin secretion are not clear. Consequently, little is known about the precise mechanism how this pathway regulates MyoVa-dependent SG transport and secretion. It is also unclear how the different pools of MyoVa-associated SGs can be transferred from the reserve pool to the readily releasable pool to increase the releasability of the SGs. These mechanisms are essential for sustained glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>451AED9D-866A-4EC4-9C01-FA029BD7180B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B735F417-9D20-418A-B063-0606F8D30C2F"><gtr:id>B735F417-9D20-418A-B063-0606F8D30C2F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Molecular mechanism of myosin Va recruitment to dense core secretory granules.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/128d164b4b408456a4507c46b9fef470"><gtr:id>128d164b4b408456a4507c46b9fef470</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brozzi F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1398-9219</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2317FFA8-A52C-4BD8-98A6-041B28C2A979"><gtr:id>2317FFA8-A52C-4BD8-98A6-041B28C2A979</gtr:id><gtr:title>Translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) is a novel glucose-regulated protein that is important for survival of pancreatic beta cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Diabetologia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3a6b57cc1b8f2d1d924ac7909df3268c"><gtr:id>3a6b57cc1b8f2d1d924ac7909df3268c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Diraison F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0012-186X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6DBB0D5A-CAD2-4536-8A99-B3D7B3656EFB"><gtr:id>6DBB0D5A-CAD2-4536-8A99-B3D7B3656EFB</gtr:id><gtr:title>MyRIP interaction with MyoVa on secretory granules is controlled by the cAMP-PKA pathway.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular biology of the cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/128d164b4b408456a4507c46b9fef470"><gtr:id>128d164b4b408456a4507c46b9fef470</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brozzi F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1059-1524</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E021050/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
