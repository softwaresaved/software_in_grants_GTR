Its particular strength is its ability to precisely place pico-litres of ink at predetermined locations on a substrate, which results in thin films, two-dimensional patterns and even three-dimensional structures. 
Of particular importance to this research is the fact that inkjet printing can place different materials either side by side, or one on top of the other. 
A logical step is to combine reactants, which has led to the emergence of a new field: reactive inkjet printing. 
The research proposed here intends to establish a dominant position for the UK in this nascent field.

The main aims of the proposed research are:
- Generate functional materials in situ using an inkjet printer as a synthesis tool. In a single process step, novel film coatings and nanostructures can be patterned and integrated into electronic devices such as conductors, transistors, sensors, printed batteries or displays. 
- Control the crystallisation of inorganic systems using inkjet printing.

The principle questions to be answered are: 
- Can the overall energy consumption involved in producing printed electronic devices be reduced?
- Are there performance increases to be gained as a consequence of synthesising material in-situ?
- Many crystalline systems have been produced by inkjet printing but can properties such as size and degree of crystallinty be controlled?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Reactive inkjet printing (RIJ) and inkjet-controlled crystallisation both build upon inkjet printing, which is an additive technique. Briefly, the advantages of inkjet printing are that it uses the 'direct write' approach that removes the need for masks, which leads to a reduction in the number of process, which leads to cost-savings, efficient use of materials and reduction of waste. Inkjet printing also allows a process to be easily scaled-up.

RIJ can be compared to microreactor chips. However, instead of pumping raw materials through channels (300-3000 microns wide) towards a reaction channel, droplets that are 30 - 60 microns wide are added to a reaction site. Advantages such as increased yield of reactions and reduced material consumption are offered since mixing and heat transfer are improved. RIJ can open a new way of performing science and is clearly multi-disciplinary. RIJ has already been used to synthesise DNA, it could also be used in tissue engineering to produce cell guides, composites technology to produce functionally graded materials and printed electronics. As an exciting new area of science, with appeal to many disciplines, RIJ offers an excellent opportunity for the PDRA who will be recruited and the PhD students who will work on this theme. There are many publishing opportunities.

RIJ offers potential benefits to industry since it leads to a further reduction in process steps. It is a more energy efficient process since the energy used to synthesise the material is the same energy used to deposit and pattern the functional material into a usable device. RIJ also offers the possibility of generating materials, and devices, with higher performances, since stabilising surfactants are not needed. (Inkjet printed tracks formed from silver nano-particles generated in-situ from MOD inks exhibit much higher conductivities than tracks formed from inks that contain stabilised nanoparticles.) 

RIJ also offers environmental benefits in that the overall energy demand of a process is reduced, and, of course, it also offers the advantages of inkjet in that material is used very efficiently. RIJ could help in the generation of strong acids, e.g. HF and structures based on heavy metals, such as Cd, since none of these materials are wasted. Less waste means less pollution, and a more energy efficient process is clearly appealing. The reduction in process steps, reduces overall process time, which should lead to increased production rates and cheaper prices.

Producing crystals with controlled sizes will appeal to industry as demonstrated very recently (July 21st 2011) in Japan, where an inkjet-based printing technique has been used to make high-performance, single-crystal thin-film transistors. The process is performed at room temperature, and is aimed towards large-area printed electronics, such as flexible displays, solar cells, electronic paper and sensor sheets. IDTechEx predicts that the market for printed electronics and electrics will be $335 billion within twenty years, just for devices primarily made by printing with electronic inks. By 2015, they suggest that the market for organic LED displays and lighting will be $8.20 billion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97179</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Printable Micro-rockets for Rapid Medical Diagnosis and Biomarker Detection</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>EPSRC and CRUK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/N033736/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>5B3450D3-0090-4A65-96C8-AE4358AB2217</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The concept of reactive inkjet printing has been used in the fabrication of silk fibroin structures.

The desire to print reactants to simultaneously synthesise and pattern places a further constraint upon ink selection, namely the necessity to correctly balance the stoichiometry of possibly disparate inks and maintenance of suitable reaction conditions on the substrate. In addition, maintaining the integrity of the desired pattern throughout the synthesis and patterning process requires a significant understanding of the wetting and dewetting of the inks. To this end, a number of different, generic techniques were established that can help control both the synthesis conditions and the patterning capability; although the applicability of each technique to a given combination of reactive inks is dependent upon the specific properties of the constituents. 


These techniques are as follows:

1 Use of a partially soluble substrate
A substrate coated with a substance that partially dissolves upon contact with the ink can be used to pin the contact line of the liquid with the substrate, and thus enable better definition of the printed pattern.

2. Controlling the temperature of the substrate
By elevating the temperature of the substrate, there is increased evaporation of carrier solvent and increased contact line pinning and both the ability to produce an arbitrary pattern and the reaction rate is increased. Conversely, lowering the temperature can slow down the reaction rate but dramatically increase ink viscosity, leading to reduced contact line motion 

3. Use of structured substrates
By using either geometric or surface energy patterning of the substrate, the deposited ink is constrained upon the substrate with a defined pattern in which the reaction can proceed

4. Patterning strategy
Deposition of individual discrete droplets, rather than a series of coalesced droplets, enables a reaction to take place independent of patterning. The gaps between a layer of discrete droplets can then be filled in with subsequent layers to enable a macroscopic pattern to be formed.

 Successful reactive inkjet printing of magnetite via a modified Massart method

 Successive printing of a stoichiometric mix of iron II chloride and iron III chloride followed by a sodium hydroxide solution led to the creation of magnetite films. To enable successful patterning and synthesis, offset printing was used in conjunction with an elevated substrate temperature (usual picture needed)

-Work carried out

 Reactive inkjet printing of polyaniline/Ag nanocomposite

 A 3 ink system (Aniline, ammonium persulfate and silver nitrate, all in 1 N nitric acid) was used to produce polyaniline in situ by means of oxidative polymerisation, together with simultaneous reduction of silver ions to form silver nanoparticles. Particular success in patterning was found when printed onto a substrate coated with polyvinyl alcohol, but this was to the detriment of electrical properties. Limited success with patterning was achieved without the polyvinyl alcohol coating, but an array of reactively printed dots was successfully deposited. This is currently being evaluated for use in sensor applications.

- Outcomes

Continued collaboration with Dr. Aoife Morrin, Dublin City University (DCU).


The main outcome was that the concept of reactive inkjet printing was applied to silk fibroin. An aqueous solution of silk I was printed followed by a layer of methanol, causing Silk II to form. The approach is being used to pattern dental membranes and to form silk swimmers.




Controlled crystallisation



-Work Carried out

Controlled templating of colloidal crystals for growth of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes

A colloidal suspension of magnetite nanoparticles was deposited on silicon wafers for subsequent use as a template for growth of carbon nanotubes by chemical vapour deposition. The deposition parameters used in printing were found to have a profound influence on the final density and uniformity of the carbon nanotube forests. A model was proposed that related the ink characteristics (particle size, volume fraction) and the printing parameters (surface coverage, droplet size) with the ability to form a close packed monolayer of colloidal particles upon the substrate upon drying. This model was found to show good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiments.
