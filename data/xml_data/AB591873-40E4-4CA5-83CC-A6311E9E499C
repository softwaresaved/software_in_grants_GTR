What exactly is it that distinguishes the glass in the window-pane from chemically identical crystalline quartz? How does ice melt? What both these examples have in common is the importance of local behaviour. Around the liquid-solid interface in melting ice, the molecules experience a change in environment. In glass, moreover, most constituent particles are almost fixed, but some exhibit correlated events of considerable motion. If we could see these constituent atoms and molecules, we might be able to move towards a better understanding of these phenomena. Beyond this fundamental interest, 'seeing' atoms and molecules is important to real-world problems, such as protein crystallisation. In order to resolve the structure of proteins, which is crucial for drug development, they must be crystallised. This has been possible with just a few proteins, and progress is only made through painful trail and error. Like melting and glasses, if we could directly see the individual particles, we should have a much better idea of what is going on.Resolving atomsIt is very hard to directly image atoms and molecules, they are simply too small. Instead, X-ray or neutron diffraction is used. Rather than direct imaging, this picks out periodic structure, such as crystal lattices and has surely contributed more than any other technique to our knowledge of the structure of matter. Although tremendously powerful in the case of regular structures, diffraction, or scattering, is less effective for amorphous materials. Enter ColloidsAlthough atoms and molecules are too small to visualise, the classroom experiment of Brownian motion in smoke particles shows that larger particles also exhibit the thermal motion which drives so much of atomic behaviour. Rather than smoke particles, we use micron-sized plastic spheres (colloids) dispersed in a solvent, which we can resolve with 3D optical microscopy. Colloids thus form a simple model of atoms and molecules, by adding an attraction between the colloids they condense to form liquids or solids. Just such an attraction results from adding polymers, the osmotic pressure of the polymers in solution 'pushes' the colloids together, to form colloidal gases, liquids and solids. Our aim is to produce a temperature-responsive colloid-polymer system, where we can study non-equilibrium behaviour, at the level of the constituent particles by changing the interactions between the particles. With this system, we shall be able to tackle a range of phenomena. In particular, we shall consider melting, self-assembly and vitrification.Industrial RelevanceThis project will have two main industrial applications, tuneable colloidal crystals and new ways to control the structure of colloidal gels.(1) 3D tuneable colloidal crystals. Colloidal crystals have interesting optical properties, due to their periodicity at optical and infra-red wavelengths, and the race is on to produce 3D tuneable colloidal crystals which will find a number of applications from tuneable filters for wavelength selection to data storage. Our temperature-responsive colloid-polymer system will deliver this 3D tuneability.(2) Controlling gelation. In many applications, colloidal and nanoparticle gels are central components of many high-value production activities, for example emerging technologies such as high-performance photovoltaic cells. The system presented here will provide a means to obtain the first direct imaging of the fundamental process of particle aggregation which leads to gelation. By controlling the quench rate, and leveraging our precise knowledge of the inter-particle forces, we shall develop a methodology by which application-specific gel structures may be optimised.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Colloids, Polymers and Temperature: Quenching by Heating and Melting by Cooling Impact Summary Benefit to UK Industry and Society Control over colloidal interactions has considerable potential in the field of functional nanomaterials. The work proposed here both for 3D tuneable colloidal crystals (A1) and self-assembly / controlled gelation (A3) will open a new way in which these structures may be produced. 3D tuneable crystals may be used as tuneable optical filters as detailed in the case for support. While the research is regarded as being at too early a stage to actively seek industrial partners, once milestones A1and A3 are reached, partners will be sought. Going forward, we can scale down from the sub-micron lengthscale relevant to this work at least to the 50nm lengthscale using the same system and thus produce 3D nanostructures, currently a challenge for nanotechnology. The work proposed touches on several key topics which have long held a fascination for the public. For example (A4), the New York Times recently ran an article entitled 'The Nature of Glass Remains Anything But Clear'. From the urban myth of window glass 'flow' to deep, engaging questions about the nature of glass, it is clear that the work proposed will resonate well in the wider community. Meanwhile, metallic glasses are tougher and stronger than metals and will likely become important materials from aircraft to buildings. Insight into a structural mechanism of vitrification is therefore industrially relevant. Collaboration, Exploitation and Application Upon completion of milestone 2, industrial support will be sought, to investigate possibilities for exploitation for example as tuneable filters for infrared laser applications. CPR has already established a relationship with a potential industrial collaborator. Communication and Engagement CPR is an active participant in the University of Bristol's Outreach program, and will take part in the Outreach tour of Schools in Cornwall next summer. He will also propose an exhibit for the Royal Society's 2010 Summer Science Exhibition. That the proposed research involves everyday phenomena, and is of a visual nature leaves CPR well placed to produce engaging and accessible presentations and demonstration experiments that are examples of front-line research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>114837</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The award focused on using temperature to drive phase transitions in a model colloidal system. Micron-sized colloidal particles suspended in a solvent are used to mimic atoms because they follow the same laws of thermodynamics, and hence form crystals, liquids and gases (and a hist of non-equilibrium states like glasses), but are big enough to resolve in a microscope. However, unlike atoms, we do not melt a crystal of colloids by heating it. This is because the way the colloids interact is rather different to atoms and molecules, and for some time, melting a crystal has proven a challenge.

The award introduces to idea that temperature can actually act inversely: we melt by cooling - not by heating. This is because attraction between the colloids, which here is mediated by polymers which are in the suspension weakens upon cooling and so crystals of colloids melt. Conversely, raising the temperature strengthens the interaction and the colloids freeze into a crystal - or form a gel.

The melting and freezing was achieved, and documented in Taylor et al J. Phys: Condensed Matter 24, 464128 (2012). However, often disordered gels were formed rather than ordered crystals, and the coordinates of the colloidal particles were not obtained. Further work to produce a colloidal crystal and track the particle coordinates is ongoing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Sedimentation remains a major challenge here, so any means to mitigate its effects would be important in fully realizing the ideas behind the award.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B2B53EDA-3531-4D1F-95A4-F3265B16EA38</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.padrus.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/47962C22-187E-41A2-B925-E66AF33DC09F"><gtr:id>47962C22-187E-41A2-B925-E66AF33DC09F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Polyhedral colloidal 'rocks': low-dimensional networks</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Soft Matter</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ecb4df9c2a69fabc4c1946fbba6d4fff"><gtr:id>ecb4df9c2a69fabc4c1946fbba6d4fff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rice R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1744-683X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B0377637-7FF8-4104-90E2-48A01122B387"><gtr:id>B0377637-7FF8-4104-90E2-48A01122B387</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phase separation dynamics in colloid-polymer mixtures: the effect of interaction range</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Soft Matter</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9e8d21fa6b116eae5e4d0219a94bd10b"><gtr:id>9e8d21fa6b116eae5e4d0219a94bd10b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1744-683X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4E844789-5D08-48E7-8CD2-209346A3FA57"><gtr:id>4E844789-5D08-48E7-8CD2-209346A3FA57</gtr:id><gtr:title>Low-Density Crystals in Charged Colloids: Comparison with Yukawa Theory</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Contributions to Plasma Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c4f958917700f56b24e28683ff4e1cf9"><gtr:id>c4f958917700f56b24e28683ff4e1cf9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rios de Anda I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/61826327-19E8-4D62-8614-2D16708AB824"><gtr:id>61826327-19E8-4D62-8614-2D16708AB824</gtr:id><gtr:title>Direct observation in 3d of structural crossover in binary hard sphere mixtures.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of chemical physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/32bce0cd8bde0f98ed8a4f4d8adda155"><gtr:id>32bce0cd8bde0f98ed8a4f4d8adda155</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Statt A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9606</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/130292EF-22B4-40BB-8754-D092A88F784A"><gtr:id>130292EF-22B4-40BB-8754-D092A88F784A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structure and kinetics in the freezing of nearly hard spheres</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Soft Matter</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/57b5b49cabe025052afda60f46db5b1d"><gtr:id>57b5b49cabe025052afda60f46db5b1d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taffs J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1744-683X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4DD4EC34-DCA7-439C-8C8C-C901ED25592D"><gtr:id>4DD4EC34-DCA7-439C-8C8C-C901ED25592D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Probing Colloidal Gels at Multiple Length Scales: The Role of Hydrodynamics.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d1fa6d1deee380a6a5bf7fe6c7324dc6"><gtr:id>d1fa6d1deee380a6a5bf7fe6c7324dc6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Royall CP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/244281A0-6B03-4935-A04A-A9846CC030EC"><gtr:id>244281A0-6B03-4935-A04A-A9846CC030EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Temperature as an external field for colloid-polymer mixtures: 'quenching' by heating and 'melting' by cooling.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of physics.
