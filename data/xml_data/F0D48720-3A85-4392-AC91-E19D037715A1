Comprised of academics, artists, filmmakers and other digital creatives, as well as festivals, financiers, distributors, commissioners and the myriad community organisations and collectives that feed into them, radical film culture is now a diverse, multidisciplinary and international field. However, despite its rapid expansion, there is at present a major lack of interaction between the researchers and stakeholders involved in radical film culture, which is in turn currently dispersed and fragmented along industrial, geographic, political and aesthetic lines. As a result, researchers and stakeholders across the many strands of radical film culture are working in disconnected ways, often unaware of one another and of the history, culture and contemporary international developments in the political moving image. A recent increase in scholarship in the field has also focused almost exclusively on the past. There is thus urgent need to counter that fragmentation, stimulate debate across these boundaries and apply and develop existing historical knowledge to our contemporary context. 

This bid proposes the creation of a Radical Film Network (RFN), which will stage four events across 22 months in the UK and US, taking place at key dates in the industry and alternative film calendar. The RFN builds upon a successful pilot project led by Dr Steve Presence at the University of the West of England's Centre for Moving Image Research, which will conclude with a conference in February 2015. The pilot project has demonstrated a clear need for such a network, having generated interest from 83 organisations in 18 countries across the globe, many of which bring existing relationships with other cross-disciplinary academic and industry institutions and community groups. The network will bring together this community of stakeholders with an international research community - ranging from world-class academics to PhD students - to address the past, present and future of radical film culture as a holistic entity, exploring four interrelated research questions based on key themes:
 
1. Ontology: What was/is radical film culture? 
2. Praxis: What were the conceptual, theoretical and practical concerns of previous radical film cultures? How do they compare to contemporary concerns?
3. Challenges: What are the challenges facing the vitality and sustainability of radical film culture? What can we learn from the past to address contemporary challenges?
4. Policy: What kind of policy will assist the RFN to continue in the long-term, and what kind of film policy do we need to enable and sustain alternative film cultures more generally (thereby encouraging more diverse film cultures overall)?

By addressing these key questions across the four events, the network will facilitate the exploration of ideas that will generate new knowledge in the field. The network and the knowledge it generates will bring theory and practice into a productive relationship both inside and outside the academic community and lead to collaborative, creative advances across these boundaries. More broadly, it will position the UK as a global centre for independent and alternative film scholarship and establish a sustainable, international network for the researchers and stakeholders involved. That network will play a key role in the critical interrogation of contemporary film culture and the power with which the medium can convey ideas and stimulate debate about some of the most important issues in culture and society today. Funding at this stage is essential to ensure groundwork of the pilot project does not go to waste and that the far-reaching potential impact of the network is realised.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Radical Film Network (RFN) will bring together organisations, artists and other stakeholders in radical film culture with an international community of world-class thinkers in the field, facilitate communication and collaboration between those involved, enhance the sustainability and visibility of innovative, radical film culture worldwide, and enrich the diversity of UK film culture and scholarship. In so doing, it will also address the fact that, despite the rapid expansion of radical film culture in recent years, the multitude of organisations that comprise it are often unaware of one another and the wider history of radical filmmaking of which they are a part.

The network will also enhance the visibility and influence of radical moving image culture within the mainstream film and television sector, as well as increasing awareness of other forms and uses of radical moving images in the digital era. A concerted research inquiry will see scholars and stakeholders explore the ontology, praxis, challenges and policy issues in contemporary radical film culture, distil the key issues facing the sector, and catalyse the production of new knowledge that will be of use to the range of user groups involved. As a result, practitioners and stakeholders will benefit from the relationship-building and knowledge exchange that will take place, as will an entire sector of fledgling micro-businesses, not-for profits, and community media organisations. The skills and experience of practitioners groups will connect with the conceptual, theoretical and historical understanding of the RFN's research community, and be of benefit to theorists and practitioners alike.

Aligning the production of this knowledge to the existing industry and alternative cinema calendar in the UK and US will raise the profile and reputation of practitioners and stakeholders and will broker relationships between radical film artists, organisations and industry stakeholders. Across the four events, dialogue will be created and relationships built with representatives from UK television commissioning (Nick Fraser, BBC Storyville); film finance (Jess Search, BRITDOC Foundation); production (Chris Hird, Dartmouth Films) and distribution (Oli Harbottle, Dogwoof); as well as with the three key exhibition and distribution infrastructures in the UK: the British Federation of Film Societies (BFFS), the Independent Cinema Office (ICO) and the British Film Institute's new Film Audience Network (BFI FAN). Similar relationships will be sought with overseas partners. 

In addition, a Policy Working Group, comprised of Holly Aylett (London Met), Simon Blanchard (Leeds), Margaret Dickinson and Jack Newsinger (Leicester) - all of whom are experts in film policy - will establish dialogue with policy-makers at the British Film Institute (BFI) from the outset of the network. Working in consultation with the BFI, the Policy Working Group will focus on channelling the new knowledge created by the network into a policy document designed to support the continuation of the RFN in the long-term and a set of policy recommendations to be submitted to the BFI and other leading film-culture institutions including the Arts Council, Creative England, Creative Scotland, Arts Council Wales and the DCMS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35540</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sheffield International Documentary Film Festival</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sheffield International Documentary Film Festival</gtr:description><gtr:id>E507D056-3665-4141-AB3B-EA386E7C485D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration will take place in June 2016, so the outcomes are uncertain at present.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>They have accepted the Session Proposal and it will feature throughout the festival's extensive publicity material and in its programme.

In addition to the conference, which took place at the University of Glasgow over three days, the festival screened 99 films across 27 venues and attracted 1745 admissions. RFN Scotland is currently planning a major series of events to mark the 50th anniversary of the events of May 1968 in Paris, which will be part of an international programme coordinated by the RFN.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/rfnscotland</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Film Institute</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1AB9B8A4-B6D0-44ED-8E82-B9F09756ECFE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I am in discussion with the British Film Institute about the Radical Film Network and how we can develop a relationship between the two organisations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bfi.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E4645AD9-D797-4097-A20F-4DDAAF0BF589"><gtr:id>E4645AD9-D797-4097-A20F-4DDAAF0BF589</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sustaining Alternative Film Cultures: the Radical Film Network</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Viewfinder Online</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1b027b52ea0d28a89d5d025cc04a1d99"><gtr:id>1b027b52ea0d28a89d5d025cc04a1d99</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>presence s</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9967DA8A-74B6-4801-9BC8-A30BE19473D1"><gtr:id>9967DA8A-74B6-4801-9BC8-A30BE19473D1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Community Filmmaking: Diversity, Practices and Places</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1b027b52ea0d28a89d5d025cc04a1d99"><gtr:id>1b027b52ea0d28a89d5d025cc04a1d99</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>presence s</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BE4063A5-FB26-4133-848E-511605AC4B5B"><gtr:id>BE4063A5-FB26-4133-848E-511605AC4B5B</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Radical Film Network: Sustaining Alternative Film Cultures</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1b027b52ea0d28a89d5d025cc04a1d99"><gtr:id>1b027b52ea0d28a89d5d025cc04a1d99</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>presence s</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M010600/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46E85C19-DECF-4873-978B-4B57CA5EAC7B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Television HTC</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
