The progeny virus particles can then go on to infect further cells, thus spreading the infection. One method of controlling virus infection is to develop drugs that will block virus replication and spread. The challenge in antiviral drug research is to design inhibitors against proteins that are unique to the virus. This should allow us to selectively block the virus without damaging host cells. The focus of this study is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children worldwide, inflicting a significant emotional and financial burden in industrialised countries and the developing world. RSV is closely related to Ebola, measles, mumps and rabies viruses. These viruses all depend on a protein called an RNA dependent RNA polymerase to multiply. This protein is a very attractive target for antiviral drug development, firstly because it is essential to the virus, and secondly because it is not found in human cells. Modern antiviral research depends on having a detailed three-dimensional molecular picture of the target protein, allowing rational design of chemicals that can block its activity. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase of the viruses listed above is very complex and we have little information regarding its three-dimensional structure, or they way it is controlled. The aim of this research is to use recently developed techniques to begin to characterise the structure of the RSV polymerase and to determine if its structure is altered under different conditions. This study will provide information as to the way in which the RSV polymerase is controlled. It is hoped that this information will be used in future in the design of antiviral drugs against RSV. Because the RSV polymerase is likely to be very similar to those of highly pathogenic, related viruses, it is possible that information that we gain regarding RSV polymerase structure will also be useful for designing drugs to control those viruses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of respiratory infection in infants and is a significant cause of disease in immunocompromised patients and the elderly. In addition, RSV is closely related to other highly pathogenic viruses, such as Ebola and Nipah virus, and is a good model for studying their molecular biology. A key enzyme in RSV multiplication is the virus encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase. The polymerase mediates transcription to produce mRNA, and RNA replication to produce progeny genome RNA. How it is controlled between these processes is currently unknown. The polymerase represents an ideal target for antiviral drugs, making it an important focus for structure-function analyses. However, genetic studies of polymerase function have been hindered by its size and complexity. Recent developments in mass spectrometry technology have opened up exciting new avenues for protein analysis. Therefore the aim of this proposal is to capitalise on these techniques to examine polymerase structure and to combine these findings with genetic analyses to examine function. The core polymerase, which mediates transcription, consists of a complex of two proteins L and P. RNA replication is also dependent on the virus N protein and there is evidence that L-P interaction with N adapts the polymerase from a transcription to a replication mode. The mechanism by which N interaction modulates polymerase function will be examined. The domain structure of the L-P complex alone and in association with N will be determined by performing limited proteolysis on L-P and L-P-N complexes and mapping cleavage sites by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. This analysis will provide information on the domain structure of the L-P polymerase and will demonstrate if the complex undergoes significant conformational change in response to N binding. Biotin labelling combined with mass spectrometry will be used to identify surface-exposed residues on the L-P and L-P-N complexes. This will identify potential N interacting domains in L-P. Based on the results from this analysis, the L and P proteins will be modified by specific mutations to disrupt N binding, and their activities investigated using an intracellular assay. This assay allows different stages in RSV RNA synthesis to be analysed, thus the role of N and L-P interaction on the initial steps of RNA replication can be dissected. These studies will provide a significant step towards understanding RSV polymerase structure and functional control and will identify a domain for targeting with designer antiviral drugs.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>459298</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>School of Biology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for Biomolecular Sciences; University of St Andrews</gtr:department><gtr:description>Mass spectrometry analysis of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) polymerase proteins</gtr:description><gtr:id>9FCF3850-01DE-400A-B202-F9EA06653377</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration generated preliminary data for a subsequent grant application to the National Institutes of Health, USA.
