&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact summary
The following groups will benefit from the work of the Retail Coordinator:
Practicing Retailers: A key outcome of the Retail Navigator project was the identification of key agendas of research interest defined by retailers themselves. Although the final report highlights 7 potential agendas, the themed called focuses on three of these as a priority: 'e' commerce, m-commerce and omni channel retailing, consumer data, and the changing nature of retail 'space'. Given that retailers have already expressed an interest in these areas, a key role for the coordinator is to ensure that they have an opportunity to shape and co-create the focus and impact strategies of individual projects from the outset as well as get access to the final findings. It is anticipated that the findings will provide new business models and a robust evidence base to make informed decisions in response to key challenges in the global retail marketplace.
Leaders of Retail interest groups and retail policy makers: the Retail Navigator final report has highlighted enthusiasm for high quality retail research amongst retail interest groups. These include the BRC, the ACS and the NRPF who are all looking for material which they can share with their members and use to enhance their reputation as sector 'thought leaders'. A number of these groups have already offered to disseminate the findings from the 3 'thought leadership' publications through their retail networks providing further evidence of their interest in the findings. Leaders of the retail arm of BIS, charged with developing the government retail strategy, have already expressed a keen interest in supporting the research projects helping to foster better research relationships between the research councils, academia and retailers. The role of the Coordinator will be to ensure that the findings and lessons learnt from the co-investment projects inform the development of the cross council brokerage model at the heart of the BIS Retail Strategy. 
The general public: Given the economic and social significance of the sector, retail research is generally considered to be extremely 'newsworthy'. The majority of the population are exposed to retail activity on a daily basis either as consumers and/or as retail employees and retail research constantly attracts media attention. The areas which are the focus of this call are considered to be particularly topical and newsworthy and already the subject of close public scrutiny. At a broader level the general public will be concerned that the research projects represent value for money and are focused on areas most likely to make a significant impact on retail productivity and performance and contribute to the social well-being of the country. The role of the coordinator involves ensuring that this is the case right from the outset.
Academic community: There is an obvious benefit of the research output to academics already researching in retailing i.e. those working within established retail research units such as RIBEN, OXIRM and the Stirling Institute of Retail studies. For these academics, the co-investment projects will add to the limited research available in at least three key areas and raise the profile of retail research within the academic community. All successful applicants will be keen to publish the outputs from their research in recognised academic journals and the coordinator will play a key role in enabling this to happen. The Retail Navigator project also highlighted interest in retail research from academics beyond the business and management discipline. Many of these academics are currently unaware that their own research might have potential retail applications. It is anticipated that the retail call will stimulate dialogue amongst this community about potential interdisciplinary research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>118800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Manchester Metropolitan University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Guest editor for special edition of &amp;quot;High Street UK 2020: Repositioning, reinventing, rebranding and restructuring&amp;quot;, Journal of Place Management &amp;amp; Development on Retail Impact linked to RSI outputs</gtr:description><gtr:id>E462E986-39F2-4B64-8BD3-8C869AF6F1F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>no outcomes yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Guest editor relationship</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>PI invited to be Guest editor for special edition of &amp;quot;High Street UK 2020: Repositioning, reinventing, rebranding and restructuring&amp;quot;, Journal of Place Management &amp;amp; Development on Retail Impact linked to RSI outputs</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>production of Retail Information Summary Sheets (ISS) for RSI cohort</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>66F7B7D0-218C-4890-9E15-9B69A6282669</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Production of 94 Information summary sheets (ISS) distributed to 9 KEO's and 8 KTP's. In total, these represented a large volume of information. Between January 2014 and March 2015 over 500 A4 pages and over 165,000 words of material.These were customised information sheets designed to provide relevant UK and global retail information specifically related to the project team agendas. This information came from a wide range of sources, including the business press, the specialist retail press, online websites, news articles tweets and blogs. This was done to ensure that the teams, some of whom were not retail academics, had the additional background information and retail knowledge they required to deliver an effective retail-related project. These were all provided in a standard format with links to the source of each piece of information and, wherever possible, the information was collated and displayed together in the ISS together in linked themes.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013,2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ESRC Retail Sector Initiative Knowledge Sharing Workshop Thursday 21 May 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DFD8C36-E296-4074-9E9F-ADF276DD45BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The focus of this third and final workshop was on capturing and capitalising on the final outcomes and initial impacts of the research projects for retailing in the future. This linked to the themes from both keynote speakers - Alan Giles, who was Chairman of Fat Face until 2013, having previously also been CEO of HMV Group plc, Managing Director of Waterstones Booksellers Ltd, Executive Director of WH Smith Group plc and Lead Non-Executive Director for the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). He is also an Associate Fellow at Said Business School, and provided an industry perspective on 'The Future of Retail' and implications for research. and iIn the afternoon, Pippa Giles, Commercial Director of The Future Foundation, developed the theme with her presentation &amp;quot;Multi-Story Shopping: the future path to purchase'. Following the format from the second Workshop, project teams were asked to provide a 5 minute presentation focused on the final outcomes of their projects and highlight the impact they felt their work would have on the retail sector in both the short and longer term. We specifically looked to attract a wider audience of retail stakeholders to this final workshop including those who might be in a position to benefit from the immediate outputs of the cohort, as well as shape the form of future research. We had convened an expert retail panel chaired by Bill Grimsey, (Jonathan Reynolds from the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, Alan Giles, Bruce Jackson from the ESRC and Professor Neil Wrigley from the University of Southampton) who led a discussion on 'Developing a forward looking retail research agenda'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>27th March 2014 1st Knowledge Sharing Event Nottingham Conference Centre</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7656F14-1668-44D1-B9D8-FB9CB2B54C2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>stimulated ideas for impact initiatives

The keynote presentation was made by Jackie Sadek, Chief Executive, UK Regeneration and Policy Advisor to the then Minister for Cities, Greg Clark MP and who provided the delegates with a unique policy perspective about &amp;quot;future retail&amp;quot;.
A key feature of this second Workshop was a 5 minute presentation from each project about their findings to date. The project teams were specifically asked to tailor their presentations to a retail audience and focus on the key 'takeouts' or to benefits which they thought this would be of most interest to this target audience. In order to make this more authentic, the presentations were made in front of all delegates but also directly to a small panel of retail experts, (Bill Grimsey, Chris Noice, and Matthew Hopkinson), who then provided each project with constructive and supportive feedback on the content of their presentations from a 'retailers' perspective. This was followed by a presentation by from Professor Cathy Parker about how she and her team had looked to created early impact from the &amp;quot;High Street UK2020&amp;quot; project. The KSW finished with a discussion led by Bruce Jackson from the ESRC about the development of the ESRC impact toolkit.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1. Involvement in the RSI activities has shaped the impact of individual projects. In particular the projects referred to participation in RSI networking activities as influential in terms of connecting to them to new income streams, identifying new business opportunities and exposing them to relevant agendas. This was reinforced in the independent review of the impact of the RSI and Navigator intermediary roles carried out by researchers at Leeds Beckett University on behalf of the ESRC during September 2016. The intermediary 'provided a way of supporting projects to adopt best practice and develop their communication channels. Peer relationships, often facilitated by the intermediary, were identified as an added value and where projects could benefit from collective knowledge sharing, gaining insights and feedback to aid their work' The conclusions have been written up as a case study which will be published on the ESRC website during 2017. The work of several of the projects has been featured in ESRC publicity:

2. Recommendations from the report have led to establishment of National Retail Research Knowledge Exchange Centre (NRRKEC) www.nrrkec.org.uk at Nottingham Business School. The launch symposium took place at the Digital Catapult London July 15th 2015 and was attended by 40 Retail policy makers and academics and retailers. The Centre initially funded by Nottingham Trent University aims to continue to support knowledge exchange within the retail sector through bringing academics and retailers together. Network contacts involved in the RSI and Retail Navigator programmes are actively engaging with the new Centre, further strengthening the legacy of the earlier work. The leadership team comprises Professor Cassidy as Academic Director and Bill Grimsey, retail mentor on the RSI initiative, as Retail Director. It is planned that the Centre will be self-funding through membership subscriptions from academics, retailers and retail policy makers by 2018. The centre has organised a study tour of Roeselare in Flanders (12-14th December 2016) to share best practice in town centre regeneration with UK retailers and policy makers

3. Four recommendations from the RSI final report used to shape good practice guidance for knowledge exchange research funding managers

4. Following on from the work as RSI co-ordinator (and PI on the ESRC Retail Navigator programme), Professor Cassidy (PI) is now undertaking an advisory role in key retail policy networks (see for example the Future Retail Working group exploring digital innovation and the Future High Streets Forum Academics Working Group. Links with relevant ESRC investments are being maintained with Professor Cassidy's appointment as Chair of the approvals committee for the Consumer Data Research Centre. https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/

5. A selection of 2,000 word case studies from the RSI cohort have been completed and published on the British Library Management Portal together with introduction by Professor Cassidy

Professor Kim Cassidy was appointed as Co-ordinator for the RSI. This was seen as an important step for the ESRC in building collaborative activities with the private sector, and is part of a commitment to encourage research that directly affects Business. The role of the RSI Co-ordinator was to develop and lead a programme to facilitate knowledge exchange between and promote impact of the RSI cohort. 

The Co-ordinator role has made two significant contributions to the retail research impact agenda. 

1. First, the activities have enhanced the skills and knowledge of project teams helping to facilitate successful impact activity. This has been achieved through workshop activities, ISS information and exposure to the impact activities of other teams. The three major Knowledge Sharing Workshops were particularly successful with delegate feedback highlighting specific examples of how the practitioner panel feedback sessions, the industry speakers and the networking activities enhanced the impact of their individual research programmes. The personalised retail Information Summary Sheets (ISS) proved to be a particularly valuable, timely and innovative source of information for RSI members.
2. A second contribution lies in lessons learnt from close involvement with the project teams about how to achieve research impact in the retail sector. These insights have generated a number of recommendations to help shape future retail sector funding initiatives. 
a. To involve a third party (or ESRC representative) at KEO project level to clarify and manage retailers' expectations and reinforce the importance of the research at a senior level within the organisation. 
b. To carry out an impact evaluation exercise with retail partners involved in the RSI at least one year after the official project end date of the initiative to generate a more meaningful 'impact' assessment. 
c. To allocate a proportion of funding as an 'impact' contingency fund to enable projects to exploit unanticipated impact opportunities. 
d. To commission research to investigate the relative importance of different dimensions of collaborative retail research projects and isolate which dimensions influence which types of impact. This research would reinforce the ESRCs pioneering role in this agenda. 
e. To place more emphasis on the development of personal research and project management skills when assessing impact. This could be achieved by calling for a 'reflective' personal assessment as part of impact evaluation.

In summary, this has been a very successful initiative and has played a significant role in enhancing the ESRC's profile as a champion of the retail research 'impact' agenda.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is anticipated that the recommendations will help to frame and develop future Government funded retail research initiatives. In particular to 'inform knowledge exchange and impact activities and guidance' (ESRC Feedback on final report). 
The Retail Sector Initiative (RSI) cohort has been established as a valuable network for retail advice and information within key Retail policy and funding forums. For example, the RSI Co-ordinator is a member of the Future Retail Working group exploring digital innovation in the sector with representatives from BIS, DCLG, KTN, ESRC and the GFirst Lep. The Innovate Future Retail Innovation Contest has also been developed with reference to input from the RSI. It is anticipated that the network will maintain this role moving forward. 
An academic paper has been submitted to the British Journal of Management based on research on impact carried out with PIs in the RSI. This will ensure that the findings are disseminated within the academic community. 
The research from the cohort continues has (and continues to) have an impact on key activity areas identified by retail practitioners. Most notably, Town Centre Management, retail crime and sustainable and ethical consumption.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F88E664F-C7F6-4A0C-BCEA-2E4EB65D6F93</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Four recommendations from the ESRC RSI Co-ordinator final report to be included within ESRC's internal Knowledge Exchange good practice guidance to investment and portfolio managers.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BD00AB29-568D-4037-B5EE-57758EDFCAC4</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>PI invited to participate in the following Retail Policy forums; Future Retail Working Group (BIS, DCLG, Innovate UK, KTN, ESRC) and Future High Streets Forum Academic research strategy group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43BD181A-8CA5-47B8-96B6-67C5A889EF9B</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002965/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F2374716-F4F8-4797-AF86-2D2436C2C14E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Retail Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
