The research addresses the following questions: \n\n1. Do young people from minority belief backgrounds feel that opt-outs respect their right to religious freedom?\n2. To what extent do young people feel that opting out impacts negatively or positively on their sense of belonging to their school and religious community?\n3. Do parents and communities consider that opt-outs in schools protect religious freedom?\n\nThese questions will be explored through interviews with a minimum of twelve young people from minority belief backgrounds (aged 13 to 18). Additional interviews will be held with at least 12 parents and six minority belief community leaders. Attention will also be paid to possible gender issues as well any conflicts that may have arisen at school, within families and within faith (or non-religious) communities as a result of opt-outs.\n\nThe research is intended to inform international and domestic human rights bodies as well as educational practitioners and policy-makers.

The interest it has evoked within these disciplines is evident in the range of contexts the research and findings have been presented, including international conferences (e.g. 'Parental Beliefs and the Welfare of the Child, Department of Law, University of Nicosia; 'Religious Education and Freedom of Religion and Belief', University of St. Paul, Ottawa; 'Diversity in Organizations, Communities and Nations', Queen's University Belfast) as well as national ones (e.g. Annual conferences of British Education and Research Association and the Association of University Lecturers in Religion and Education).
The project team have also been asked to present the research at their own institutions in different research forums and share their experiences relating to the interdisciplinary and ethically sensitive nature of the research.
The fundamental premise that opt-out clauses protect the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of young people in schools has been subject to limited scrutiny by international human rights bodies, educationalists and academics. The assumptions behind it have not been assessed from the perspective of the minority belief young person, and the socialisation impact of differentiating students in this manner has not been explored.
In the UK, as in many other countries where religious education has a place in the education system, the right of parents to withdraw their children from such teaching (and related activities such as school worship) on grounds of conscience is enshrined in domestic law and in international human rights law. However, this parental right sits uneasily with the notion of the independent right of a child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (e.g. Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child). These articles have particular relevance to this project as the voices of young people from minority belief backgrounds have not been considered in the literature relating to the development of human rights standards on religious freedom in schools. Additionally, parental decisions to withdraw their children from religious education set students from minority belief backgrounds apart from their peers during the school day. This division has the potential to shape young people's relationship with their school and society, as well as their relationship with their parents and belief community. 
Internationally, significant attention in recent years has been focused on the importance of religious awareness as a dimension of education in values, intercultural understanding and citizenship, encouraged by international consultations and recommendations by the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion and Belief. These documents highlight that the purpose of educational provision in general and religious education in particular should be to promote knowledge, understanding and mutual respect. In the academic literature, such considerations are underpinned by theoretical assumptions derived from education for democratic citizenship, and diversity although empirical research exploring minority pupils' experiences and perceptions of such educational strategies has remained scarce. 
The current research findings therefore address important gaps in the academic literature within human rights and education, which will provide a better understanding of the impact of current human rights law and religious education opt-out provision on minority belief young people, schools and communities.

This project has raised important issues for those engaged in the management and support of Religious Education in schools, especially in relation to the way in which legal rights are communicated to parents, pupils and teachers, and also in relation to issues of diversity and inclusion. The project recommendations have identified a number of significant issues that need to be followed up at various levels in this respect.
Issues are also raised for those involved in teacher education in the preparation of Religious Education specialists for post-primary schools. Student teachers will need to be made aware of the legal and human rights issues as well as of the philosophical issues and pedagogical practices surrounding the teaching of religion in publicly-funded schools. The report provides a clear basis for future good practice for those involved at this level.
Other important issues relate to the awareness and practices of voluntary organisations that offer support to members of religious minorities, such as the Northern Ireland Inter-Faith Forum. The report has provided a stronger evidence base for the members of such organisations in relation to the needs of the various families and communities that they represent when they are considering approaching schools to enquire about the teaching of religion and should help to ensure much better mutual awareness of their rights and options.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B67C263D-45FB-401A-928C-7DF717C549B4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>International human rights law permits the teaching of doctrinal (i.e. confessional) religious instruction in schools and holds that opt-out clauses are a sufficient means to protect and respect the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion of those who do not wish to participate in it. While conscience clauses in domestic law may predate this standard, current domestic law and policy is informed and legitimatised by this international human rights norm.

This research explored the issues surrounding the workings of the opt-out clause in schools. Its core aim was to examine the opt-out clause through the perspectives of young people (13 -18 years) of minority belief and assesses its suitability as a mechanism to protect religious liberty in a diverse society. Additional interviews were held with parents and minority belief community leaders. 

Project objectives
To gather information regarding how far young people from minority belief backgrounds believe the opt-out respects and protects their right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion
To identify to what extent these young people believe that the process of opting out is a negative or positive experience which may impact on their sense of belonging to their school and religious community
To gather the views of parents and communities regarding the extent to which opt-out clauses protect religious identity and freedom in schools.
To evaluate the adequacy of the current status of opt-outs and religious liberty in schools in order to identify key policy drivers which should inform international human rights standards and domestic policy in the area. 
To draw up evidence-based recommendations for policy and educational practice. 

Key findings
Young people and parents from minority belief backgrounds are not necessarily aware of opt-out rights in relation to religious education and, in particular, to other religious occasions in school. 

The existence of the right to opt out did not necessarily lead students to feel that their religion or beliefs were acknowledged and respected in the school. The lack of attention given to their beliefs in the RE curriculum caused them to feel that these beliefs were not valued or respected by the school, nor indeed more widely by the education system. 

The lack of accessible and transparent policies and procedures dealing with opt-outs as well as the lack of consultation relating to alternative arrangements for opted-out students led to a sense amongst many minority belief students that their beliefs were not of interest or concern to their school. In order for pupils to feel respected and protected in their right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, young people expected schools to move beyond merely offering a poorly executed opt-out clause. 

Pupils' experiences of opt-out provision varied widely between schools and within schools, depending on the teacher's approach and attitude. Pupils' satisfaction with opt-out provision was based on their age, self-esteem and confidence in their own beliefs as well as the presence of other pupils opting out of religious education in the class or school.

Most parents who were faced with an opt-out decision spoke of the fear that their child would 'stand out' and feel excluded with some suggesting that the right to opt-out was not so much a protection mechanism for minority belief individuals but an 'exclusion clause' and that it was damaging to a child's self esteem if her or his beliefs were not recognised within the school and the curriculum.

The results of the research have been published in a report launched by the Chief Commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission at a dissemination seminar attended by policy-makers, practitioners and academics. The report contains legal and educational recommendations to international human rights bodies and educational authorities and has been widely distributed to these bodies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the research have been widely disseminated as follows:
