Each point in an X-ray projection gives the integral of the attenuation along a line from an X-ray source to a receiver point, and thus the problem of constructing an image becomes the mathematical problem of finding a function based on its integrals along straight lines. This problem was solved in 1917 by Johann Radon. A natural generalization is to ask whether a function can be determined by its integrals along a family of curves rather than straight lines. When the curves are defined in a special way, as the geodesics of a Riemannian metric, we have the geodesic X-ray transform. This transform also arises independently in several applications.

The proposed research aims to investigate whether the geodesic X-ray transform of a function is sufficient to uniquely determine the function, and whether there are numerical methods to recover the function which are not overly sensitive to noise. Mathematically this corresponds to determining whether the transform is injective, and whether the inverse is continuous. Currently there are a number of cases in which the geodesic X-ray transform is known to be injective with stability estimates for the inversion including when the curvature is bounded above in an appropriate manner, when the manifold is simple and the metric is sufficiently close to a real analytic metric, and in dimension at least three when the manifold can be foliated by strictly convex hyper surfaces including the boundary. While these results include many cases, in fact examples which arise in practical situations, when considering for instance travel-time tomography, still are not covered. For example, it is unknown whether the existence of conjugate points (i.e. when geodesics beginning at a single point cross each other) implies that the transform is not injective, and generally the relationship between the geometry of the geodesics and the injectivity or non-injectivity of the transform is not well understood. Studying the transform in the case of complicated geometries including conjugate points is important because this is truly the generic situation; that is, conjugate points almost always exist in practical situations.

At the beginning of the project, the researcher will fully investigate the application of microlocal analysis to the geodesic X-ray transform. This will allow classification of the cases in which it is possible to construct a parametrix, or approximate inverse, for the transform thus showing that the inversion is a Fredholm problem. A corollary is thus that the kernel is at most finite dimensional and inversion is stable on a complement of the kernel.
At the same time the researcher will investigate the possibility of introducing alternate natural metrics on the unit sphere bundle in order to control portions of the Pestov identities arising in the study of the transform via energy methods. The original proof of injectivity in the case of simple manifolds used these identities, and the proposed research will investigate whether this can be pushed further by carefully analysing alternate geometries in the unit sphere bundle.

After completing the microlocal study explained above, the researcher will investigate the application of analytic microlocal analysis to the question of injectivity for the geodesic X-ray transform. This will require development of an analytic calculus of Fourier integral operators, and the proposed research will attempt to do this using methods from harmonic analysis.

The research will also look at numerical methods for inverting the geodesic X-ray transform. The initial work in this direction will take advantage of a characterisation of the inverse transform in terms of projections onto certain subspaces in L2 of the unit sphere bundle, but will proceed from there to investigate other methods.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is motivated both by the many potential applications for inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform, and a fundamental interest in the theoretical questions surrounding injectivity and stability of the transform in complicated geometric situations which have been open for at least 30 years. Results from this project would answer such longstanding questions, as well as open the way for future research.

The proposed research fits within the larger mathematical discipline of inverse problems, the area of mathematics concerned with constructing images of objects based on a limited selection of measurements. Well established examples of the application of inverse problems include the creation of three dimensional images from multiple X-ray projections in computerised tomography, from energy emitted by spin relaxations in magnetic resonance imaging, or at a completely different scale, the location of oil, natural gas, water, or geological structures appropriate for carbon sequestration deep underground from seismic data. As a discipline, inverse problems seek to provide a common mathematical framework for the analysis of all these problems and implementation of practical algorithms to pass from raw data to useful images, or other types of information.

The research questions proposed for study in this project have been open for at least 30 years, and continue to be of great interest in the inverse problems community. Answers to the proposed questions would shed light on the fundamental capabilities of several different imaging methods. The geodesic X-ray transform arises directly in many applications including ultra-sound transmission tomography, optical tomography with variable index of refraction, seismic travel time tomography, and atmospheric shortwave or acoustic tomography. In particular, the microlocal analysis portion of the research will contribute to the understanding of artefacts which appear in images created by methods due to complicated ray geometries, and potentially give insight into how to remove these artefacts. Similar methods may shed light on reflection tomography problems as well and give insight into what types of receiver and source geometries should be used in that context. Methods developed could also apply to analysis of other cases in which integral geometry problems arise such as photo-acoustic tomography, and synthetic aperture radar. Additionally, injectivity of the geodesic X-ray transform has implications for elliptic inverse problems such as the anisotropic Calderon problem in which identifiability is implied by injectivity of a corresponding attenuated geodesic X-ray transform. Further research on the topics included in this proposal, which will certainly be impacted by the successful completion of the current research, would involve inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform acting on tensor fields, and the weighted geodesic X-ray transform.

Broadly, the development of new imaging technology relies on contributions from many disciplines, including mathematics for insight into the fundamental capabilities of such new technology, and for numerical algorithms to create images in practice. This project will contribute to such understanding.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82757</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IPMS 2016 (Turkey)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB49B321-98B4-4C0D-A8B1-299CCD51CC18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited talk at an international conference.

Through an application of the calculus of Fourier Integral Operators, I clarified the geometric requirements for stability of inversion of the transform in three or more dimensions. In particular, I showed that the inversion is stable when there exist only regular conjugate pairs that satisfy a so-called &amp;quot;graph condition&amp;quot;. These findings appear in a paper which has been accepted, but not yet published. Unfortunately, I have also determined that singular (i.e. not regular) conjugate pairs occur generically in three dimensions. The set of singular conjugate pairs is discrete, and those that occur generically can be classified into a finite list of possible cases, which all have so-called &amp;quot;normal forms&amp;quot;. It should be possible to analyze each case individually, however thus far I have not been successful at this. Additionally, it is not yet clear whether the additional graph condition ever holds in three dimensions, or holds generically. Some previous work has already shown that there exist examples in which the graph condition does not hold, but there are not yet any known examples in which the condition does hold. This therefore shows a way for future research on these still open questions.

I have also developed numerical methods for inversion of the transform by discretization of the problem and inversion of the resulting matrix. This method is effective, and I am now using it to investigate the question of stability, which corresponds to ill-posedness of the matrix arising from discretization, numerically. I anticipate combining this numerical investigation with further results on the cases of singular conjugate pairs, and the graph condition described in the previous paragraph. While the necessary code for these numerical methods has been written, publications resulting from its use are still in development. When these are complete the code will be made openly available as laid out in the grant application.

In collaboration with Dr Francois Monard, as described in the grant application, I have also looked at the problem of injectivity of the transform in two dimensions when there are conjugate points. Together we have worked on this problem, but have not yet been successful. We have tried many different approaches including modification of the geometry in the sphere bundle as described in the grant application, reformulation as a Volterra equation, which appears to be capable of proving injectivity in the real-analytic case, but not the general smooth case, and Carlemann estimates. We are continuing to attack the problem. In the original grant it was proposed to also look at the problem of injectivity in more than two dimensions, but significant progress has been made on this case by another research group since the beginning of the grant, while the two dimensional case with conjugate points still remains open.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Directions for further academic research on the topic of this grant have already been mentioned above including the investigation of the case with singular conjugate pairs using the known normal forms, and the graph condition. In reference to the pathways to impact statement included with the grant application, my increased expertise on the topic of microlocal analysis, developed as part of the study of stability of inversion of the geodesic ray transform on this grant, will be an avenue for impact. Indeed, I have had a request from an industrial contact to provide a short course on the topic relating to the application of synthetic aperture radar, and I am coordinating with an academic researcher working in seismic imaging to develop a book on the topic aimed at that particular application.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DB6695A5-4AA8-4CF8-9335-48A21567FF2F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B6C9DF1E-A131-418A-90BD-E12D66C361D1"><gtr:id>B6C9DF1E-A131-418A-90BD-E12D66C361D1</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Multi-Grid Iterative Method for Photoacoustic Tomography.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE transactions on medical imaging</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/41bf31c59ce04ee06eb86f66b59733e5"><gtr:id>41bf31c59ce04ee06eb86f66b59733e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Javaherian A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0278-0062</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M016773/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CFBD6626-50CB-4AA6-8B49-9A76519BA91F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Numerical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
