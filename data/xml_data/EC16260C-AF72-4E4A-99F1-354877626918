This project will explore the science behind these discoveries and develop prospective applications. First, we will develop a robust experimental and theoretical framework for manipulating emulsion drops and for creating nanofluidic networks with laser beams. Second, we will use this platform to reveal the physical and chemical principles governing the structure and dynamics of these nanothreads and use the nanothreads to explore the physics of transport in nanofluidic networks. Third, optical deformation of polymerisable emulsions will be developed as a technology for microfabrication of polymer objects with complex 3-D shapes. Such microparticles have potential applications in medical devices, drug delivery, MEMS, photonic materials and ion sources. Finally, we will establish the principles for using these nanofluidic networks to carry out chemical reactions on the attolitre scale.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic beneficiaries are an important set of intermediaries in the long-term economic and societal impact of this project. This project starts virtually 'from scratch' and aims to establish a firm experimental and theoretical grounding for droplet deformation and transport. While we have identified two areas of application that we will develop in our project - microfabrication of complex plastic objects and chemical reactions in nanofluidics networks - the full potential of this work will only be realised when other academic groups adopt our ideas and methods and apply them to a broad range of applications. We have described the academic communities we believe will benefit from this project in the previous section. In commercial applications, microscopic plastic shapes with appropriate mechanical properties could be used as components in micromechanical systems, for example as valves, gears or actuators, and as tissue engineering scaffolds. Polymer components have the advantage over ceramics of lower coefficients of friction. A specific application of shaped polymer particles is the fabrication of targets for ion beam production, which is being developed as part of the Basic Technology LIBRA consortium. Self-assembly of shaped particles into regular arrays could have applications as photonic bandgap materials in optoelectronics; to date most colloidal self-assembly has been limited to spheres. Micromechanical components have applications in medical devices, both for microbiological research and potentially in microsurgery. Chemical and biochemical reactions in femtolitre vessels is of particular interest in pharmacological and radiological research, where the high toxicity of materials (or limited availability) favours reactions on the smallest practical scale - this is one of the drivers for current lab-on-a-chip research. The future development of new ultra-small-scale technologies that combine chemical reactions at the attolitre scale with solid-state technology will require an understanding of how complex chemical and physical phenomena occur at these previously unattainable levels of detail. Membrane nanotubular connections have recently been identified as dynamic junctions between cells that provide a new route for HIV-1 transmission, vesicular transport between macrophages and long distance communication between killer cells and target cells. Unfortunately progress in this field is hampered by our understanding of material transfer at this length scale and a lack of tools with which to generate these connections in-vitro. This project will directly address both these technological bottlenecks. Current proteomic technologies are limited with respect to absolute quantification of protein levels and drug efficacy assays including toxicological responses often miss rare but important events as result of working with large populations and limited control of spatial delivery. Researchers at IC have already demonstrated that nanotube connections between microdroplets and target cells can be used as platforms for undertaking proteomics ( Nanodigestion ) - in effect performing biopsies at the single cell level. This work in this proposal will make it possible to deliver material to a spatially defined location of a single cell by using the trapping lasers to pump material from the microdroplet to the cell. Such single cell tools are indispensible to the study of rare cells such as stem cells and progenitor cells that do not lend themselves to high throughput protocols.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1077634</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>49000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Industry funding - SCR</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Schlumberger Cambridge Research</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>24D0E9BF-32EA-47B3-9BCC-F98D61D819AE</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>132000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Impact Acceleration Account</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A54ACD24-E14C-4ED8-B8DD-D003F83BAB63</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The key aims of the grant have been to develop novel high-throughput strategies for the manufacture of ultra-low tension droplets with control of size and composition. In the presence of optical traps ultra-low tension droplets (ULTDs) can be sculpted; such that their shape can be controlled. We have made excellent progress with respect to the generation of ULTDs and the integration of these systems with the optical trapping assemblies. In parallel excellent progress has been made with respect to modelling the behaviour of ULTDs. Building on this foundation we have been exploring applications of ULTDs as building motifs for chemical reactors and shaped nanoparticles. This has included the construction of 3-D nano-networks that can be used as the basis for controlled sequential reactions exploiting oil based chemistries. The ability to manufacture such oil based &amp;quot;labs on a chip&amp;quot; where reagents can systematically be added to a reaction chamber has already attracted strong interest from the biotech sector.
The behaviour of ULIFT droplets is of interest to our partners in the oilfield services, though the current low oil price has led to shelving of surfactant-enhanced oil recovery programmes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F58D8937-D639-416F-952D-C2F11D7EDEE9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project was divided into four workstreams on optics, chemistry, microfluidic engineering and theory. These workstreams were then brought together to address the key objectives of the project. We briefly address the technical developments in each of the workstreams and then how the workstreams were integrated.
 
(i) Optics
Spatial light modulators were used to create multiple traps to shape droplets in 2 and 3 dimensions and to create nanofluidic networks in 2 and 3 dimensions. Two methods for measuring the 3D shape of deformed droplets were implemented: confocal microscopy at the LSF at RAL and structured illumination at Durham. A rig was developed for UV polymerisation of trapped droplets with Raman detection of the progress of the polymerisation reaction. A FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching) experiment was developed to measure the flow rate through nanothreads.

(ii) Chemistry
The phase behaviour of both temperature-sensitive and temperature-insensitive microemulsion formulations was characterised. The effect of polymers on the interfacial tension (IFT) was explored in the ultralow IFT (ULIFT) regime.

(iii) Microfluidic engineering
Microfluidic devices were developed comprising a flow-focussing junction (FFJ) for generation of oil droplets and an observation chip (ObC) for deforming them. The design allows the generation of monodisperse 3-10 &amp;micro;m drops at moderate IFT and the transfer of these droplets to the Peltier-controlled ObC where ULIFT is achieved, based on the phase behaviour determined in the 'chemistry' workstream. Both temperature and salinity can be used to control interfacial tension across four orders of magnitude. In addition, a microfluidic tensiometry technique for the quantitative characterisation of the mechanical properties of the ultralow interfacial tension droplets was developed. We combined the microfluidic platform for droplet generation with the analysis of thermally-driven capillary waves/fluctuation analysis for the measurement of ULIFT and the results compared with literature data from spinning drop tensiometry.

(iv) Theory
A numerical 'spokes' model was implemented to compute the shape of a droplet in one or more optical traps. An analytical asymptotic model for droplet deformation in a single trap was developed and compared with the numerical model. The effects of buoyancy were added to the theoretical model. A theoretical model for flow through nanothreads was developed, which places an upper limit of the length of the nanothread through which fluid can be pumped using optical pressure from the trapping lasers.
 
Integration
(i) A parametric study was completed on the formation of droplets in an FFJ as a function of salinity and temperature in an AOT/brine/heptane system. Droplet generation is possible even in the ULIFT regime if interface is created faster than surfactant can adsorb to the nascent interface.
(ii) The effect of laser heating on trapped droplets was modelled in Comsol and the consequences for the behaviour of temperature-insensitive emulsions in an optical trap was explored experimentally. Intriguing behaviour including the spontaneous generation of new phases was observed and explained in terms of the phase diagram of the quinary mixture.
(iii) The deformed shape of a single droplet in an optical trap was measured experimentally, including the observation of the theoretically predicted hour-glass shape. Experimental shapes were compared with theoretical predictions.
(iv) The shapes of droplets were characterised for three or four traps in a plane as a function of the optocapillary number (a dimensionless parameter that measures the relative strength of optical and capillary forces). The formation of a tetrahedron with out-of-plane traps was attempted. The importance of incorporating buoyancy and spherical aberration in theoretical models and practical implementation of droplet shaping strategies was highlighted.
(v) Initial experiments on the production of connected nanodroplet networks in 3D were successfully conducted</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the short term, we plan to bring to a conclusion the objectives of the project that were not fully attained: specifically, (i) optimisation of the strategy for shaping droplets in 3-D; (ii) measurement of polymerisation kinetics in trapped droplets and optimisation of strategy for maintaining ULIFT during polymerisation; (iii) generation and characterisation of 3D nanodroplet networks, involving 4-way junctions and closed loops.
 
In the longer term, shaped microparticles have potential applications in medical devices, specialist coatings, drug delivery, micromechanical systems, photonic materials and ion sources. Nanofluidic networks could also be used as a means of performing chemical reactions using only tiny volumes of the chemicals. Our main route for exploitation is using the optical deformation of polymerisable emulsions of monomers as a technology for microfabrication of objects with complex 3-D shapes. Nanofluidic networks could also be exploited in as a means of performing chemical reactions on the attolitre scale and we are exploring this opportunity through follow-on funding.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B58BAAB3-AE26-400F-BFA1-9C0DD7D7AA89</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/069F1F97-8004-4E3C-86F0-64F5AC9ECE90"><gtr:id>069F1F97-8004-4E3C-86F0-64F5AC9ECE90</gtr:id><gtr:title>A microfluidic platform for the production of monodisperse ultralow interfacial tension oil droplets in water</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>18th International Conference on Miniaturized Systems for Chemistry and Life Sciences, MicroTAS 2014</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cea76f8733e88198b441b38e73e33579"><gtr:id>cea76f8733e88198b441b38e73e33579</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bolognesi G.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E26ECD01-101F-47C6-A73C-0B5D28ADED99"><gtr:id>E26ECD01-101F-47C6-A73C-0B5D28ADED99</gtr:id><gtr:title>Microemulsion droplets in optical traps</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Molecular Liquids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b9f36c3dac5a9fdfa94525c85e7456e6"><gtr:id>b9f36c3dac5a9fdfa94525c85e7456e6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hargreaves A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B83FA6BC-18B3-4CFE-9C06-3A08C56D1874"><gtr:id>B83FA6BC-18B3-4CFE-9C06-3A08C56D1874</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nanofluidic networks created and controlled by light</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Soft Matter</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7284c33dcd450b4d41fa570a391cd461"><gtr:id>7284c33dcd450b4d41fa570a391cd461</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woods D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/88299A42-4098-4C07-B244-8452890FBA00"><gtr:id>88299A42-4098-4C07-B244-8452890FBA00</gtr:id><gtr:title>A microfluidic platform for the production of monodisperse ultralow interfacial tension oil droplets in water</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8997cb23151880d87af0b77c5439a9cc"><gtr:id>8997cb23151880d87af0b77c5439a9cc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bolognesi G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D153BD01-E301-42E7-BF28-8E4E3F799CD4"><gtr:id>D153BD01-E301-42E7-BF28-8E4E3F799CD4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mechanical Characterization of Ultralow Interfacial Tension Oil-in-Water Droplets by Thermal Capillary Wave Analysis in a Microfluidic Device.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8997cb23151880d87af0b77c5439a9cc"><gtr:id>8997cb23151880d87af0b77c5439a9cc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bolognesi G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0743-7463</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8E12FF28-8D0A-4C69-ABB0-A3DE7D0918D7"><gtr:id>8E12FF28-8D0A-4C69-ABB0-A3DE7D0918D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Theoretical analysis for the optical deformation of emulsion droplets.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optics express</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7a00942b12e2160e099a35f0feefb58d"><gtr:id>7a00942b12e2160e099a35f0feefb58d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tapp D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1094-4087</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I013377/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
