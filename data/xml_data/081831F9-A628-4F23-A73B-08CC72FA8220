Entrepreneurship for the Future</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/P008003/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The RELIEF Centre will research pathways to achieving inclusive growth in the context of mass displacement and movement of people around the world. Achieving inclusive growth involves looking beyond monetary indicators and GDP, and towards multidimensional notions of prosperity that reflect people's quality of life and well-being. There is growing evidence that inequality is harmful to individuals and societies, and that both social and economic inclusion contribute to sustainable gains in prosperity. Prosperity is consistently eroded by poor educational opportunities, poor health, poor social cohesion, and poor employment prospects. But what does it take to achieve inclusive growth of prosperity in today's world, where 63.5 million people are forcibly displaced according to the UNHCR? Given the magnitude of displacement across the globe, it is no longer enough to see movement as an anomaly. The geopolitics of war, climate change and social inequality mean that this is now the 'new normal' for people, whether they are 'hosts' or 'movers'. In response to this, the RELIEF Centre will mount an interdisciplinary social science project that will speed up the globally critical sustainability transitions required to improve the quality of people's lives. The core will be a programme of research, education and civic engagement that develops a vision of future prosperity for Lebanon - the country with the largest number of refugees per capita in the world today - but with findings and outputs that will be applicable to other countries throughout the world. The Centre's research programme comprises the following four research themes (R1 to R4), addressing key aspects of inclusive growth for prosperity and social cohesion:
 
R1 Post Conflict Cities will examine how Syrian refugees and their host Lebanese communities that can collectively participate in the design of more resilient and better quality living environments in contexts of resource constraint in Lebanon. This theme will also explore mechanisms for public engagement in the reconstruction of cities in Syria if/when Syrian refugees decide to return.
 
R2 Creating Value will identify existing collective goods for communities (of both hosts and refugees) in Lebanon, as well as the most efficacious forms of investment in communities to address their needs. This strand will consequently develop a model to assess the value of successful community-driven projects for enhancing and delivering collective goods in terms of both job creation and well-being.
 
R3 Future Education will mobilise new technologies to deliver affordable education to refugees and hosts in Lebanon, as well as generate data for the three other research themes. The RELIEF Centre will develop a curriculum of massive open online courses (MOOCs) aiming to provide people with the skills and capacities for managing conflict, improving environments and well-being, and creating opportunities for flourishing. MOOCs will include surveys at the outset, and at regular intervals throughout the course, on the specific needs of refugees and hosts. This data will then be used to improve them, as well as help address the other themes' objectives.
 
R4 Prosperity Gains and Inclusive Growth will examine what prosperity and inclusive means for refugees and hosts, how they view their prospects for a better life, and their role in making gains in prosperity. R4 will produce a conceptual framework and methodology for understanding what drives prosperity gains, as well as develop mechanisms and methods for refugees and hosts to monitor prosperity gains or deficits in their communities and cities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The RELIEF Centre focuses on one of the world's pressing challenges: how to build a prosperous and inclusive future for communities affected by mass displacement. It aims to have both conceptual and policy impact by reframing debates surrounding the future development of sustainable cities, the education and capacity-building of refugees, the use of new educational technologies to deliver education to people on the move, and the indicators and metrics which communities, NGOs, academics and governments use to assess wellbeing and prosperity. In so doing, it will inform the development of policy, practice and service provision on international, national and local levels.
Beneficiaries and target audiences of this project include members of refugee and hosting communities in Lebanon, municipal authorities, governmental ministries, NGOs, Lebanese universities, international and regional agencies, aid donors, and educational, health, welfare, and technology providers. The demand for research outputs of recent, relevant projects carried out by the RELIEF project team is such that we now have an established network of key practitioners, policy-makers and academics who are committed to critically exploring future education and urban development in contexts of protracted displacement including, in particular, in Lebanon.
The RELIEF Centre's strategy for engagement with target audiences is to directly engage stakeholders, including representatives of key international development and humanitarian organisations such as UNHCR, UNDP, Islamic Relief, Save the Children and OXFAM, as well as relevant Lebanese Governmental Ministries and interested Governmental Ministries across the MENA region and Europe. 
Methods for communication and engagement include publishing a series of multi-lingual (Arabic, English, French) Policy Briefs to be launched at Policy Roundtables, held once annually in both Lebanon and London. This will allow the findings and recommendations arising from the Lebanon case study to be disseminated directly to key stakeholders. The Roundtables will provide a space for mutual learning amongst members of refugee and host communities, local and national organisations, national ministerial staff, regional humanitarian actors and international agencies active there. 
The findings and policy recommendations will also be disseminated to non-academic audiences via a multilingual (Arabic, French and Spanish) issue of Forced Migration Review, which is the leading open-access practitioner and policy-focused publication on displacement issues, with a readership of over 20,000. On the local level, the policy-relevant findings will be disseminated through informal lessons-learned workshops.
A series of podcasts, press releases and multimedia outputs (including blog posts, BBC radio programmes, and online articles) will be published and distributed throughout the course of the project, providing overviews of the research findings in English, French and Arabic. These activities and outputs will contribute to increasing public awareness of innovative ways of responding to protracted displacement, debates regarding the roles of municipal authorities, businesses, local communities and civil society, and the importance of recognising the agency of refugees and local communities affected by conflict and displacement. 
In addition to working with UCL's Media Relations Office to offer radio, newspaper and TV interviews, the Centre will build upon existing media contacts to ensure a broad dissemination of research findings to audiences across the Middle East and the UK. In particular, we will author and co-other accessible blog postings, press releases, BBC radio programmes (i.e., BBC3, BBC World Service, BBC Media Action) throughout all stages of the project. We will also continue contributing to newspapers such as The Guardian, The Washington Post and Al-Jazeera, and to online platforms such as The Conversation, IRIN, and Open Democracy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4117492</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P008003/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D4B9AE9-278F-4867-8D5E-31631698729E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5678A899-0926-491B-8E52-E55211E3F83B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>ICT and education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>648B790C-8CC1-40BA-B713-BF27B871D211</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
