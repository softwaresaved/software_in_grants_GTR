To improve chances of survival organisms need to know about these changes in advance. Like a wristwatch that enables humans to organize their day, organisms have evolved internal clocks that enable them to tell what time of day it is and to adjust their behaviour accordingly. Circadian clocks are somewhat inaccurate and naturally tend to tick slightly faster or slower compared to the 24-hour rhythm of the day. Therefore, without adjustment circadian clocks will soon be out of synchrony with the environment and indicate the wrong time of day. In the natural world, however, the 24-hour rhythms in light and temperature conditions speed up or slow down the circadian clockwork to exactly 24 hours, such that circadian clocks can remain accurate timers. Although a great deal is now known about the molecules that built the circadian clockwork, our picture of how the circadian clock is synchronized to the real world is still patchy. We propose to identify the molecules and mechanisms that help clocks to synchronize their rhtyhm to that of the environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our external environment is shaped by daily and seasonal rhythms in light and temperature conditions. To exploit the opportunities and meet the challenges arising from these conditions, organisms need to accurately predict and respond to their rhythmic surroundings, a task made possible by an internal timing mechanism, known as the circadian clock. Without this endogenous clock, temporal organization breaks down, resulting in reduced fitness, developmental defects, and disease. A powerful eukaryotic model system for understanding the molecular bases of circadian clocks is the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. In Neurospora the products of the frequency (frq) gene are central components of the circadian clock and frq transcript and FRQ protein oscillate in abundance with period lengths of about a day. frq transcript oscillation arises from rhythmic activation and repression of frq gene transcription, mediated by the transcriptional activator complex WCC (WHITE-COLLAR complex) and its repressor FRQ. Besides this transcriptional regulation, posttranscriptional control mechanisms, including the regulation of protein and RNA stability, are known to be similarly important for establishing a functional clock. Because this molecular clockwork produces rhythmicity that deviates from the exact 24-rhtyhm of the natural world it needs to be synchronized to the 24-rhtyhm of our environment, a process called entrainment. Light and temperature are the most potent cues that can entrain circadian clocks. Existing models for resetting are based on experiments in which discrete light-pulses have been shown to rapidly induce or degrade clock components. However in the natural environment clocks are entrained by complete photoperiods and not short light pulses and we still do not know how clocks entrain in these conditions. In addition to the well-described FRQ-WCC based night-time oscillator we have recently identified a VVD-dependent daytime oscillator that is required for proper light-dark entrainment of the Neurospora circadian clock. The existence of such oscillators and their importance for clock entrainment has been predicted on theoretical grounds but our findings offer the first molecular entry to this problem. The proposed work will identify the components of the newly discovered daytime-oscillator and other VVD-controlled pathways by 1) using genetic screens to identify daytime oscillator mutants and suppressor of vvd mutants, 2) elucidate VVD's role in influencing frq-RNA levels at dusk, 3) using mass spectrometry and micro-array analysis to identify partners and targets of light-signalling pathways that are influenced by VVD. The proposed work will thus fill a significant gap in our knowledge of how circadian clocks control timed gene expression in the real world.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>247462</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Image of Neurospora slant cultures illustrating use as a genetic model system</gtr:description><gtr:id>12C9213D-023E-41F1-860A-9809F45D2F7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Request for using it in text books from abroad and advertising our research within the University</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Images</gtr:title><gtr:type>Image</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2007</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Arrays of Neurospora petri dish cultures showing a collection of Neurospora single gene deletion mutants</gtr:description><gtr:id>89D044B9-3772-473F-84F6-A3D0900D7851</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Requests for use in biology textbooks and advertising research of our group within the Faculty and University as well as highlighting our summer school work with school children</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Petri dish images</gtr:title><gtr:type>Image</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Computational biology</gtr:description><gtr:id>64204769-FAAE-42F2-8798-D0485A01B536</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There are no outputs yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partner is a computational biologist who brings the modelling know-how to the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our findings of novel circuits that govern temperature compensation of circadian clock-controlled output pathways inform the design of computational efforts to model temperature compensated output pathways and discover the required network architecture that enables temeprature compensated gene expression networks.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBSRC funded Summer School</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3E1EADF1-ED1C-4FBA-9A7A-E76E8ADCD592</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main aim of this summer school is to encourage an interest in science through the provision of an interesting and worthwhile project that makes significant contributions to the phenotypic characterization of a model eukaryote. Over a three-week period students undertook independent lab work, learned to use laboratory equipment, and devised and carried out their own experiments. Students improved their practical and analytical skills and learned about the use of model organisms in scientific research. Data and images were uploaded to The Broad Institute database from where they can be accessed worldwide.

The ability to predict these changes with the help of endogenous biological clocks is of advantage to organisms as it helps species to maxmise their chances for survival by adjusting their physiology and behaviour to best suit the time of day. The natural period of circadian clocks is slightly longer or shorter than a 24-hour day so circadian clocks need to adjust their periods to stay in tune with the 24-hour day. Daily rhythms in light and temperature are the main factors that tune circadian clocks to the environment. In this project we discovered that the photosensing molecule VIVID that we previously identified as important for synchronising the Neurospora circadian clock to light-dark cycles, also plays a role in maintaining accurate time in different ambient temperatures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Understanding the activity of molecules involved in light and/or temperature sensing, such as VIVID, can be exploited in the development of light and temperature-regulated switches that can be used to control genetic pathways. Moreover, an understanding of how genetic pathways are buffered against changes in ambient temperature may help to design synthetic pathways that are operative in a wide range of temperatures. The ability to control biological pathways by light and to make them temperature-insensitive will provide a valuable research tool in the dissection of gene function and has potential uses in biotechnology where it can help in pathway control and optimization of yields of biopharmaceuticals, for example.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3377ACC3-3EBC-4FC8-A084-59FCDDC091E5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This model simulates the Neurospora circadian system and has given insight into parameters that are critical for maintaining temperature compensation of circadian period, a key feature of all circadian clocks.</gtr:description><gtr:id>77DA1ECC-F2EF-4DE5-92C6-E94D450D697F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are currently further improving using this model to include temperature-compensation of clock-controlled output pathways to help us understand the network architecture that is necessary to maintain stable phase-relationships of temperature-controlled output pathways in poikilothermic organisms such as Neurospora.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Temperature-compensation model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B7D850EC-6AAC-497F-A539-E90EDB246BF2"><gtr:id>B7D850EC-6AAC-497F-A539-E90EDB246BF2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Temperature-sensitive and circadian oscillators of Neurospora crassa share components.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/de87720ab5502fb9205d283314e6d091"><gtr:id>de87720ab5502fb9205d283314e6d091</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hunt S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0016-6731</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BE05854D-6C76-41E2-A53D-F88CABAD0066"><gtr:id>BE05854D-6C76-41E2-A53D-F88CABAD0066</gtr:id><gtr:title>VIVID interacts with the WHITE COLLAR complex and FREQUENCY-interacting RNA helicase to alter light and clock responses in Neurospora.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e68ffc64fb768b06ab29fee80ead5ac8"><gtr:id>e68ffc64fb768b06ab29fee80ead5ac8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hunt SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/03E30A31-8235-443E-80A3-8597F2DFA002"><gtr:id>03E30A31-8235-443E-80A3-8597F2DFA002</gtr:id><gtr:title>The PAS/LOV protein VIVID controls temperature compensation of circadian clock phase and development in Neurospora crassa.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Genes &amp; development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e68ffc64fb768b06ab29fee80ead5ac8"><gtr:id>e68ffc64fb768b06ab29fee80ead5ac8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hunt SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0890-9369</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A17FFA91-3BF3-4334-9C3C-5DB4DA8A5C60"><gtr:id>A17FFA91-3BF3-4334-9C3C-5DB4DA8A5C60</gtr:id><gtr:title>Detection and response of the Neurospora crassa circadian clock to light and temperature</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Fungal Biology Reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4e0e76957b0309e407d42f6ef6f261a2"><gtr:id>4e0e76957b0309e407d42f6ef6f261a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crosthwaite S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D00988X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
