The Science of Hermaphroditism in Spain, 1850-1960</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/E003028/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>At least since Ovid's story in Book IV of his Metamorphoses, in which the gods Hermes and Aphrodite, embodiments of ideal manhood and womanhood, had a son named Hermaphroditos, has hermaphroditism been a subject of fascination for the West. Hermaphroditos was also a perfect man but his encounter with the nymph Salamacis, who requested that the gods united her to the boy, resulted in Hermaphrodite, a body with double sex or 'in-between' status. Such a story fired the western literary and medical imagination both for its attractiveness /the harmonious combination of two 'opposites' in one body / and for its marvellous or unsettling nature/ the mixing of the two sexes that would neither be one nor the other but which might signify great good or evil to come.\nThe hermaphrodite as a marvellous entity continued in the western imagination amongst natural philosophers and literary exponents until the eighteenth century when a profound transformation took place. The 'real' human hermaphrodite, actually uniting more than one sex, slowly lost currency as secularization and changes in science took place. From this period, the real hermaphrodite was declared impossible in humans and scientists began to talk about 'pseudo-hermaphrodites' or bodies that appeared to combine the two sexes. From the early nineteenth century, doctors presented with cases of ambiguous sex drew up taxonomies for the identification of the real biological sex, often for legal purposes or for permission to marry. Instead of classifying most of these persons as real hermaphrodites, they graded the differences between the sexes and allowed for the combination of different traits of each sex in the same body. On this basis, a final declaration would be made as to the real sex of the person. Thus, under the category of pseudo-hermaphroditism individuals could be designated male pseudo-hermaphrodites if they were judged to be primarily male and female pseudo-hermaphrodites if the opposite were true.\nWhat methods of diagnosis allowed doctors to identify the real sex of the body? If previous methods had utilized primarily sight and touch as the principal tool for sex identification by examining the external genitalia, from the early to mid-nineteenth century the criteria aiding identification changed to incorporate a broader variety of characteristics including comportment, hirsuteness, timbre of voice, existence of breasts and gestures. From the late nineteenth century, new diagnostic techniques allowed for the extirpation and analysis of the ovaries and testes under the microscope. In this way, the ovaries and the testes, or the gonads, became the overriding guideline in the determination of sex. \nThe science of hermaphroditism, however, did not rely on sex identification from the gonads alone for long. From the 1920s, with the discovery of 'male' and 'female' hormones, endocrinological accounts of real sex took centre stage. The 'truth' of the body was now found to lie in the hormones secreted by the body and not necessarily in the gonads. However, in the 1930s it was confirmed that some hormones previously known as 'female' were found in non-hermaphroditic males and vice versa. The idea that the two sexes were radically different and incompatible led, with the aid of new psychological theories of gender development, to the notion that the sexes were graded rather than rigidly differentiated and that a variety of factors / genital, gonadal, hormonal and psychological / conferred the real sex of the person.\nAs can be seen, changing factors were articulated by medicine in order to declare the sex of an 'intersex' individual. This research project focuses on how these processes were played out in Spain during the years 1850-1960 in order to assess whether this country followed other broadly European diagnoses of sex in line with the shift from identification being based on the genitalia, to being based on the gonads, the hormones, and, finally, psychological gender mix.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-12-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20679</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Hermaphrodite, Fecundity and Military Efficiency: Dangerous Subjects in the Emerging Liberal Order of Nineteenth-Century Spain</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E47A3B0D-461C-4892-8C8E-0C2A2C96B32A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>paper given at Association for Contemporary Iberian Studies conference, Dublin City University, 8-10 September 2009</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project analysed the reception of medical notions of human hermaphroditism - the idea that people may share biological characteristics of both sexes, making them neither male nor female in any straightforward manner - in Spain from 1850 to 1960 and found that discourse on the subject had altered as medical technology, the social environment and gender considerations changed over time. The project also traced the internationalisation of medical thought in Spain, arguing against the commonly held idea that Spain was far behind many other European countries in scientific terms. Instead, it was shown that Spain generated its own ideas on the subject of sexual identity and hermaphroditism. 

It was shown that long-standing ideas on hermaphroditism from the thought of Hippocrates and Aristotle still informed Spanish medical thought in the nineteenth century and that there was increased interest in the medical profession, and especially the medico-legal profession, to determine clearly and definitively the sex of any 'doubtful' individual as the nineteenth century wore on. This was partly due to advances in the scientific and diagnostic techniques used but also shows how social and political concerns over ambiguity, lack of clear distinction between men and women and social anxiety about homosexuality, for example, all combined to make up a field of urgent inquiry. 

As the twentieth century dawned, new theories were developed and hermaphroditism was re-cast as 'intersexuality', a much broader category that included 'gender deviance' of different types. In turn, the categorizations of hermaphroditism became more complex and, at the same time, less easy to apply to individuals between the sexes. Previous cases of 'hermaphrodites' were re-written as being 'really' cases of genital deformation and the incidence of 'real' hermaphrodites tailed off. However, the catch-all term intersexuality included 'hermaphrodites', virile women, effeminate men and male and female homosexuals. Further reconfigurations ensued in the period opened by the Franco dictatorship (1939-1975) and by the late 1950s doctors informed by Catholicism etched out a more humanistic conceptualisation of hermaphroditism consonant with human dignity. By the 1960s, the category was confined to an even smaller repertoire and other related notions emerged such as 'transexuality'.

As well as documenting primarily medical texts on hermaphroditism, the study showed how medical theories do not exist in isolation but emerge through interchange with political, social and other factors. As such, the work makes a contribution to the history of Spain, to medical history, gender studies and history of sexuality research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>While historical, the text can be used as part of the on-going analysis of persons who are declared or declare themselves to be 'hermaphrodite', 'intersexual' or 'transgender'.
