In addition, the evidence base on UK firms is less developed compared to evidence from major OECD countries. This project aims to investigate how incentive schemes such as Research and Development (R&amp;amp;D) tax credits affect the level of R&amp;amp;D expenditures; and how the latter impacts on firm performance in terms of survival, growth and job creation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The following research questions will be addressed:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>What is the effect of the R&amp;amp;D tax credits scheme on R&amp;amp;D expenditures of UK firms?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Does firm survival depend on R&amp;amp;D effort, after controlling for firm and industry characteristics?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What is dynamic relationship between R&amp;amp;D expenditures, firm growth, and firm-level employment creation?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How does the UK evidence compare with existing evidence from OECD countries?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will utilise secondary data from three Office of National Statistics (ONS) databases: the Annual Respondents Database (ARD); the Business Research and Development Expenditures Database (BERD); and the Business Structure Database (BSD). Multiple data analysis methods will be used, including policy evaluation, survival analysis and dynamic panel estimation. The findings will contribute to existing knowledge and support evidence-based policy and practice.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries

While developing this project, we have consulted with six representatives of potential stakeholders. Our aim was to elicit their views on how the research question can be made policy- and practice-relevant and what aspects of the innovation-performance relationship should be prioritized for investigation. The stakeholders we have consulted are:

Public sector: The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS); and the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Private sector: The Confederation of British Industry (CBI); and the Northern Trust Corporation.

Third sector: National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA); and the Secure Data Service of UK Data Archive (SDS).

Consultations with our stakeholders have enabled us to identify other potential stakeholders, which include: The Technology Strategy Board (UK), the Trades Union Congress (TUC), the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA); and the Europe INNOVA unit of DG-Enterprise of the European Commission. 

This experience led us to adopt a snow-balling approach to maximising stakeholder engagement. The approach is informed by the systematic review methodology and consists of expanding the stakeholder engagement as the research project unfolds. The expansion will be driven partly by recommendations from existing stakeholders and partly through discovery of new organisations or entities as we gather more information about the stakeholder landscape. We will keep a record of the snow-balling process and report the number of stakeholders we engaged over time. 

The snow-balling exercise will also benefit from inputs by members of the Project Advisory Board. The latter will include representatives from BIS, ONS, SDS, and NESTA; and two academic peers: Professor Sushanta Mallick of Queen Mary, London and Professor Tom Stanley of Hendrix College in the US. 


Benefits

The proposed research will benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including the general public. This is due to the nature of the research topic, which has significant implications for jobs, welfare, firm competitiveness, quality of life, and effective public policy. The potential benefits are explained below.

R&amp;amp;D Tax Credits is a public policy intervention based on the premise that innovation has positive externalities. This quality justifies subsidization because the level of R&amp;amp;D effort by firms may remain less than optimal if it is determined by market forces only. 

Our policy evaluation analysis will enable us to establish whether the scheme leads to higher R&amp;amp;D effort by comparable firms or it does tend to 'pick-up winners'. In other words, does it address the externality problem? Or, does it just induce firms that already spend more on R&amp;amp;D to use the scheme more heavily than others? The answer to this question has significant implications for welfare-maximization objective of the public policy. 

In addition, our research will shed light on whether the R&amp;amp;D effort affects wealth and job creation; and how this effect may vary between firms, industries, types of R&amp;amp;D expenditures, geographical regions and liquidity constraints exacerbated by the recent credit crunch. These findings will enhance the scope for better-informed decision making by policy makers, employees, institutions specialized in the economics and management of innovation, financial institutions, and investors. 

With enhanced information on the innovation-performance relationship, policy-makers will be able to fine-tune the policy to maximise welfare; employees will form better expectations about innovation's effect on employment and wages; research and advocacy organisations will be able to extend their research into controversial issues; and the cost of capital for R&amp;amp;D expenditures will be less distorted by asymmetric information between firms and financial institutions/investors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>128275</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Policy implementation horizon for R&amp;amp;D instruments</gtr:description><gtr:id>80051FD0-309C-49B2-93F4-4CFEC70220EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New collaboration.

However the productivity and rates-of-return effects we estimated from all published research (64 primary studies reporting 1262 estimates) are lower than what is reported in narrative reviews. We also identified a range of moderating factors that explain the variation among reported estimates. Moderating factors with significant effects on variation in the evidence base include: (i) measurement of inputs and output; (ii) model specifications; (iii) estimation methods; (iv) levels of analysis; (v) countries covered; and (vi) publication type among others.

With respect to UK, the meta-analysis results indicate that studies investigating the effects of R_and_D investment on productivity and rates of return in UK firms do not report systematically different estimates compared to other studies investigating firms/industries in other OECD countries. 


After our presentation, we have had a series of discussions with academics at Staffordshire University and the Norwegian School of Economics on meta-analysis of R_and_D subsidies and R_and_D effort; and on meta-analysis of R_and_D and rates of return.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://innovation-uk.cepgr.org/activities</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our project (ES/K004824/1) was completed at the end of December 2014.

In June 2015 we held a workshop that brought together academics and other research users from the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and the UK's Innovation Agency (Innovate UK). 

Professor Jonathan Haskel (Royal Economic Society and Imperial College) and Mark Franklin (ONS - Office of the Chief Economic Adviser) stated that the data we have deposited with UKDS reflects best practice in data linkage. The datasets (3) are rich in content and offer significant scope for use in further research on R&amp;amp;D investment, productivity and firm dynamics (exit and entry) at the industry level. 

Robin Wilson (Head Technologist - Innovate UK), David Legg (Strategy and Planning Economist - Innovate UK) and Edward Woolley (Head of Innovation Analysis - BIS) indicated that our findings on the relationship between R&amp;amp;D subsidies and the firm's privately-funded R&amp;amp;D investment provide food for thought. The lack of additionality effects we reported, if remain robust to further checks, may require a re-think in the design of the direct R&amp;amp;D grant policy.

We have conducted further robustness checks and will report the findings again to colleagues from BIS and Innovate UK on 16 February 2016. In that workshop, we agreed to provide all the material in advance, review the findings (which confirms absence of additionality effects), and discuss potential implications for policy and practice. We also expect to have inputs from BIS and Innovate UK on current government thinking about the R&amp;amp;D grant regime, which may be replaced with a mixture of grants and loans (see Financial Times http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/310e1be8-7b0f-11e5-a1fe-567b37f80b64.html#axzz3uZip0hCe). We hope to have an evidence-based input into the policy debate on this issue.

Our paper on the effect of subsidies on privately-funded R&amp;amp;D investment was chosen as the best conference paper for excellence in research at the Advances in Business-Related Scientific Research Conference on 15 October 2015 in Rome. The conference was attended by academics, business people and business analysts.

Professor Mehmet Ugur was invited as a keynote speaker to the Global Congress of Knowledge Economy on 14 November 2015 to present our findings on the relationship between R&amp;amp;D investment and firm productivity in the UK. The Congress was held in Qing Dao (China) and brought together internationally renowned researchers, business leaders and innovation analysts.

Finally, two papers from the research project (on R&amp;amp;D investment and firm survival; and a meta-analysis of R&amp;amp;D investment and firm productivity) are under review for publication in a top-rated journal in the field of innovation and performance. Both papers are in the second-stage of the review process. 

We are currently in the process of submitting three further papers for publication in high-ranking journals (on subsidies and private R&amp;amp;D investment; R&amp;amp;D investment and UK firm productivity; and R&amp;amp;D intensity and job creation). 

In summary: the pathways to impact are evolving in accordance with our commitments in the application. The time frame for material impact is expected to be around 3 years; at the end of which we expect to contribute to evidence-based policy and practice.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ADE7C848-9198-4381-AB2A-81F446729ADC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We addressed four research questions on research and development (R&amp;amp;D) investment and firm performance: 

1. Does public support for R&amp;amp;D investment encourage firms to increase the level of privately-funded R&amp;amp;D effort? 
2. Does R&amp;amp;D intensity increase firm survival rates?
3. What are the effects of R&amp;amp;D intensity on employment creation?
4. What are the effects of knowledge (R&amp;amp;D) capital on firm productivity? 

Innovative modeling and adherence to best practice in microeconometric research enabled us to make two contributions to existing knowledge. 

First, we found that the relationship between subsidies, R&amp;amp;D effort and firm performance follows curvilinear rather than linear patterns. Specifically, we found that matched funding from UK government is associated with increased R&amp;amp;D effort on average, but the level of additionality declines as the recipient firms' R&amp;amp;D intensity increases. The pattern is similar with respect to firm survival and employment creation too: From low levels of R&amp;amp;D intensity to begin with, an increase in R&amp;amp;D intensity leads to increase in survival rates and employment creation, but the effect tapers off and becomes negative as R&amp;amp;D intensity increases. 

Secondly, we found that the 'average effect' reported in most of the existing literature on R&amp;amp;D investment and firm performance conceals a high degree of heterogeneity among firms. We found significant evidence of heterogeneity in the following areas:

a. The effect of knowledge (R&amp;amp;D) capital on productivity is relatively larger among firms within: (i) industries with above-median concentration levels; and (ii) technology classes that are science-based, specialised and scale-intensive. 
b. R&amp;amp;D intensity has a positive but decelerating effect on full-time jobs for R&amp;amp;D personnel (scientists and technicians); but the effect on full-time non-R&amp;amp;D jobs is negative but the adverse effect is decelerating.
c. R&amp;amp;D intensity has a positive but decelerating effect on overall part-time employment; but the rate of part-time job creation is higher for female employment compared to male employment.
d. Finally, the effect of R&amp;amp;D intensity on survival is mediated through the level of market concentration in the firm's industry. 

Given the indications of non-linear patterns and heterogeneity indicated above, the average and monotonic effect-size estimate reported in most of the literature may have limited applicability as a guide for policy and practice.


The rich datasets we assembled have strong potential for use in addressing new research questions related to firm dynamics, employment generation and growth. One such question concerns the effects of the recent financial crisis on the type of firms that enter and exit with respect to R&amp;amp;D intensity, size and growth rates. The second is about the fall in labour productivity during the recent crisis and the persistence of lower productivity levels thereafter. The third question relates to evolution of firm size distribution and the relationship between firm size and growth. These questions address issues of high policy relevance, including: (i) whether the persistence of low labour productivity has been due to changes in utilisation of labour or knowledge capital or both; (ii) whether small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are significant contributors to growth and employment creation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings indicate that selection for R&amp;amp;D support tends to favour R&amp;amp;D-intensive and high-growth firms rather than those with higher levels of employment. However, the relationship between these firm characteristics and the probability of receiving R&amp;amp;D support is non-linear. This is a sign of good practice, indicating that the selection process does not rely on one-dimensional bets. However, it also raises questions about the relative weights used and whether the trade-offs dimensions (e.g., between R&amp;amp;D intensity and employment) are justified by the level of additionality. These policy issues can be discussed fruitfully with inputs from our stakeholders at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and Innovate UK.

In addition, our work tallies with data-linking and productivity research with which the Office of National Statistics (ONS) is involved nationally and internationally. ONS experts are keenly interested in our findings and in how they can be taken further in ONS or joint work.

Finally, our findings are also highly relevant for academic researchers involved in microdata analysis. Non-linearities and heterogeneity in microdata are well-known issues but with little or no treatment. Our proposed modelling and estimation methods are highly likely to encourage a rigorous debate.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5184ED59-7696-4DD5-A994-0B9804DEB21C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://innovation-uk.cepgr.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Method development in meta-analysis</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4BF34551-BACD-4740-9241-1680E0914BB2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Ugur delivered a series of workshops on meta-analysis as an evidence synthesis methodology.
