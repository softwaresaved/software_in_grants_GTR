It is innovative in tackling core research questions through practice-led research and interdisciplinary symposia. Events will be sited in England, Scotland and Wales to examine the impact of devolved governance and cultural infrastructures. As market towns struggle in the current economic climate, this project is timely in pursuing the feasibility of alternative strategies to enable market towns to secure a sustainable future. In so doing, it aspires to the aims of the AHRC's Connected Communities programme.\n\nResearch Context\nThe Labour Government launched its Market Towns Initiative in 2001 to address the problems posed by demographic shifts and changes in retail habits, work/life balance and general mobility. In response, several regional networks were launched throughout the UK and the umbrella body 'Action for Market Towns' formed (www.towns.org.uk). Recent research has developed a definition of variously termed market, small or rural towns as having between 1500 and 40,000 inhabitants. This places such towns as 'in-between' places and they have been largely neglected in studies especially related to cultural activity. Often market towns have contradictory fortunes: they are desirable place to live but become commuter towns with inhabitants who commute to their workplace and to larger retail centres. This leaves the town centre vulnerable and the town's cultural identity challenged. The Department of Environment, Transport and Regions see market towns as having considerable policy relevance as a rural hub for economic development and regeneration. Almost a decade after the launch of the Market Towns Initiative, the role that of visual arts practice in this context remains inadequately explored.\n\nIn order to tackle this gap in knowledge the network will innovatively bring together practice-based and theoretical researchers from a range of disciplines including: arts practice, architecture and planning, heritage, cultural and economic regeneration, cultural policy and arts administration. In recent years, vacated shops and shop fronts have become emblematic of the problems faced by market towns but also a prime site of artistic intervention. Keeping in vein with this, the proposed networking events will address research questions through artistic practice in public locations, such as market squares and shop fronts, as well as workshops.\n\nAims and Objectives\nThe aim of this network is to develop new understanding and critical analysis of the role that visual arts have played and might play in the regeneration of market towns with a view to influencing policy and informing best practice.\n\nIt will do so by:\n- Networking a multi-disciplinary body of artists, theorists, professionals and policy makers engaged in market town studies and cognate fields, such as planning, heritage and regeneration. Disseminating results back to key research groups and networks (e.g. Action for Market Towns).\n- Developing a knowledge base of practice (best and worst; perceived successful and unsuccessful drawn from case studies and their evaluations) \n- Facilitating knowledge transfer between participants\n- Generating critical dialogue through artistic practice, symposia discussions and on-line debate\n- Creating artworks in the public domain as catalysts for discussion, engaging the public in wider debate\n\nThe network will develop a new knowledge base on cultural regeneration in market towns and facilitate knowledge transfer between artists, regeneration professionals, community organisations and policy makers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research network has the potential to have wide impact to immediate participants and wider constituents. The academics involved will bring their expertise to the network as well as benefitting from the subject area being approach from new, particularly creative, angles. This will be taken back to their respective departments and research groups which are the prime focus for research in this area. The participants who will benefit include the arts and community organisations directly involved (Dumfries and Galloway Arts Association, Hexham Community Arts Forum, Inspire Northumberland) and cognate organisations (such as Deveron Arts, Huntly and Allenheads Contemporary Arts, Allenheads) who will be invited to the event and who will be able to access information from the Intersections website (www.intersectionspublicart.org.uk). The insight generated will also benefit sector organisations such as the Action for Market Towns Network; regional Market Towns Forums and local authorities. These organisations will be invited to the event, informed through e-mail newsletters and will be able to access proceedings and discussions on the Intersections website. The debate generated will also be of interest to local regeneration agencies, such as OneNorthEast and local authority planning, arts and regeneration departments. The work will be relevant to strategic bodies in various disciplines, for example the Department of the Environment Transport and Regions - dealing with issues facing regional and rural economies and infrastructure, and think-tanks such as IXIA: Public Art Forum and PAR+RS: Public Art Research + Resource Scotland. Existing connections with the European Regions of Culture network will widen the reach and impact of the network, as well as engaging them in the process as it unfolds. Most importantly, the work will engage community led-initiatives and local development or heritage trusts, such as the Hexham Community Forum and the the Pontypool Town Heritage Initiative - broadening their networks and giving them the opportunity to engage in active dialogue with a range of constituents. Finally, with arts events taking place in public spaces, the research will engage and bring issues to public attention.\n\nThese various organisations will benefit by seeing art as a critical force within the fields of planning/placemaking, community cohesion and through positive association with place and identity. They will have the opportunity to engage and develop networks with a diverse range of constituents. The research will impact on their work in this regard by: generating new knowledge and facilitating knowledge transfer; creating material for use in advocating good practice; building capacity in professional and volunteer networks for future; realising projects in the public realm; assisting specific local authorities in the adoption of culture as part of their strategic planning; contributing to the wider public debate on the value of cultural expenditure from the public purse. To ensure they benefit information will be disseminated as the project unfolds via the Intersections website and relevant umbrella organisations.\n\nThe network will generate new cultural knowledge with potential economic and societal impact that can enhance quality of life. It will be managed through an Steering Group with representatives from partners to ensure engagement and increase likelihood of impacts. In the short term the effects of the research will be: impact on current interdisciplinary debates on cultural regeneration and artistic practice, development of knowledge base and facilitation of knowledge transfer; in the medium term: impact policy within regulatory and funding bodies, development work of arts and community organistions, particularly with regard to more sensitive commissioning processes and arts practices for market town context and</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35669</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Chris Morton undertook a mini residency funded by Northumberland County Council producing the 'I-Spy Public Art in Hexham' chapbook which he handed out to people on the street during Day One of the symposium.

Hexham Inbetween Symposium stimulated artists to research use of empty buildings in the town (Neon Arts https://www.facebook.com/NeonArts) and a group of young people to establish Hexham Young Arts Forum (http://www.nowfilm.eu/works/youtharts/) which held its own 'symposium' looking at professional opportunities in arts and cultures for young people.

This network sought to bring together an interdisciplinary body of researchers, policy makers, professionals and practitioners to critically consider the role and potential of visual arts practice, policy and cultural infrastructure in the cultural, economic and physical regeneration of market towns. 

Recent research defined variously termed market, small or rural towns as having between 1500 and 40,000 inhabitants. This posits them as 'in-between' places - neither rural peripheries, nor their urban counterparts - and this intermediate state has left inbetween towns neglected in studies related to cultural activity (with the early work undertaken by 'On the Edge' Research based in Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, an important exception) and, as been argued by the Rural Cultural Forum, in policy making and funding. 

In 2001 the Labour government launched the Market Towns Initiative (MTI) to address problems posed by demographic shifts and changes in retail habits, work/life balance and mobility in market town areas. In the wake of this, several regional networks emerged and 
the umbrella body 'Action for Market Towns' was formed (www.towns.org.uk). 

Often market towns have contradictory fortunes: they become desirable dwelling places (the term 'market town' has certain cultural cachet) but largely as commuter satellites for urban workplaces and retail centres. This leaves market towns and their identities vulnerable. The Department of Environment, Transport and Regions see market towns as having considerable policy relevance as rural hubs for regeneration; and yet the means by which this is to be enacted remains unclear. As rural researchers have noted, the influential but now critiqued 'creative city' and 'creative class' discourse cast urban and rural as binary opposites - with the urban dynamic creative hubs contrasted to the individualized, craft-based, slow-tempo activity of the rural. This stereotypical and over-simplified approach presents challenges to those thinking about both the rural and 'inbetween' places as to whether it is desirable or advantagous to look at urban models of cultural regeneration or whether a new understanding, terminology and strategy is required.

In order to explore these issues we held a series of three networking events, developed in partnership with local organisations so context directly shaped discussion and the debate could inform local developments. Rather than academic venues, events were purposefully situated in local spaces and places to reach out to a broader public constituency. We worked closely with teams in three locations: Dumfries, Hexham and Pontypool; sites in Scotland, England and Wales, which allowed for exploration of the impact of devolved governance (through the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Westminster Parliament) and alternative cultural infrastructures (through Creative Scotland, Arts Council England and Arts Council Wales, respectively). Alongside symposia-style activities we sought to generate art activities that, similarly, explored the future of market towns. 
As market towns struggle in the current economic climate, this project is timely in pursuing thinking on the feasibility of alternative strategies to enable market towns to secure a sustainable future.

Project Structure
At the core of the project were three two day symposia held in the partner towns of Pontpool (September 2012), Hexham (October 2012) and Dumfries (November 2012). The programme also included a preparatory planning event (Newcastle University July 2012) bringing together the core teams from the partner towns and a final two day event (Newcastle University June 2013 - co-funded by the Newcastle Institute for Social Renewal) that brought together core Inbetween partners and projects in Newcastle City (involving re-use of empty buildings) and in Northumberland involving rural arts projects. The final event examined developments following on from Inbetween and further potential for links between the university and the partners involved.

Project Development
The success of Inbetween was very dependent on developing good relations with partners, understanding differing expectations, resources and capacity of the different partners and researching the partner locations. This takes time and resources and a significant amount of work was put into development at the outset of the project: establishing the partnerships, making further contacts through them, using those networks to research the locality and developing dialogues around the best structure for each symposium.

There was a basic format of three two day events each involving a core group of all partners. This was modified for each location. 

Pontypool
The Pontypool event, developed in collaboration with Sarah Pace of Addo Creative (http://www.addocreative.com/) and Clare Baker Senior Regeneration Officer at Torfaen County Borough Council (TCBC), began with a day touring locations in the town with presentations and interactions from residents and organisations to establish context, present a body of knowledge and information and introduce dialogue around key issues. The second day was discussion formed around a series of presentations. TCBC used Inbetween to develop an artists residency funded through the Arts Council of Wales as one of its pilot projects looking at public art development.

Hexham
The Hexham symposium was developed with the Hexham Arts Forum (HAF) (http://www.hexhamcommunity.net/pages/arts-forum.php) who wanted a strong public involvement. It began with an evening public debate about cultural provision in Hexham, followed by a day of discussion using the Open Space model that produced a set of objectives for HAF (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) and ended with a day of public events in the town involving organisations, artists, musicians and performers. For example sixth form students at Queen Elizabeth High School ran drama classes and artist Chris Morton had a market stall engaging people in 'I-Spy Public Art in Hexham' (funded through Inspire Northumberland). The day ended with a final discussion among the core group.

Dumfries
The Dumfries event also had public involvement. The Stove (http://www.thestove.org/) used Inbetween to develop a series of artists' residencies and the Inbetween symposium was programmed as part of a week long 'festival' presenting the outcome of the residencies. The symposium began with an evening event presenting artists' projects. This was followed by two days of presentations, discussions and 'interactions' with the town. A meal on the second evening was turned into a discussion about regeneration through interventions by historical characters 'invited for supper' by Robbie Burns (performed and facilitated by Mischief La Bas http://www.mischieflabas.co.uk/web/news-events-mischief-la-bas/174-the-lost-supper).


Impact and further development
The differences between partners has been key to further development in each location. Broadly there was a shared vision about examining the role of art and artists within regeneration strategies - looking at the potential for re-imagining a place and for active engagement by a broad range of people in that re-imagining and in developing delivery strategies.

However, the structure of the main partner groups (a local authority, a partnership of arts organisations and an artists' group) gives different sets of aims, access to resourcing and capacity. These have been key to further development in each location.

Pontypool
In Pontypool the main partner was the regeneration team at Torfaen County Borough Council. They were looking at new approaches to engaging the public and non-council organisations in regeneration plans. As part of the programme they appointed an artist in residence (Alexia Mellor http://alexiamellor.com/) with an open ended brief of 'making connections'. This was a very new way for them to work with an artist. The residency followed on from the symposium developing the dialogues and contributing to thinking around the next phase of regeneration. TCBC is now involved in a large capital funding bid which includes redeveloping a set of buildings for cultural use. An initial research and evaluation phase is being undertaking by Satori Lab (http://thesatorilab.com/) and Intersections at Newcastle University funded by Arts Council Wales.

So this is focused around a traditional local authority approach dealing with heritage building stock. However, the long term aim is to establish these venues as independent, community and artist driven projects. So the initial research is to facilitate community engagement, build capacity and research similar models elsewhere. Dumfries and Hexham are seen as important to this both by TCBC and Arts Council Wales.


Hexham 
Hexham Arts Forum is a grouping of individuals and organisations involved in cultural provision in Hexham. It is part of the Community Partnership which is a development trust that generates a significant part of its income from the Forum Cinema. HAF's aims are both cultural and community driven. It is not a delivery organization - it's a forum for discussion of cultural provision and it's development. It can, for example, propose that Hexham be designated an 'Arts Town' but is neither resourced nor structured to deliver that in the way a local authority like TCBC could. 

Development of youth arts has been high on HAF's agenda and a significant outcome of Inbetween has bee the establishment of a 'Youth HAF'. This came from young people who were involved with Inbetween but also others who weren't but who were impressed by the event. At Easter 2014 YHAF used the Inbetween model to organise a one day festival with stalls presenting arts projects, a discussion and events across the town.


Dumfries
The Stove is a group of artists with considerable experience, individually and collectively, of organising projects, engaging different publics and working with public bodies (and their agendas and strategies). A key moment in their development was taking on a building redeveloped by the council in the main central square of Dumfries. This was earmarked for cultural use but it needed a clear vision and a plan to achieve that. The driving force for that is the link between arts and regeneration - with the artist as a key component. Two significant parts of Stove's programme are artists residencies and public events. They were very well placed to use Inbetween as both a programme catalyst and a critical forum. 

For Stove, more than the other two partners, the role of the artist in regeneration and therefore also artists' development is high on the agenda. This is well evidenced by the continued development of their programme of research residencies and links with projects such as sustainability at the Crichton University Campus. 

It is significant that TCBC are looking to The Stove as a model for arts development in Pontypool. However, Pontypool does not have the critical mass of artists that powers The Stove. They are looking to develop this partly through a partnership with Newport University but what has been a very organic development in Dumfries will need a much more constructed approach in Pontypool.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>See comments above re artists' networks, critical mass and diversity of artists, partnerships with non-arts agencies, local government etc.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5FE3E94A-54DA-4C30-BF51-815ECEC1C99F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I022414/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D2B04A8-2CC9-41D9-B5EF-78E0AF1A8B24</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Installation &amp; Sound Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
