He wants the best for his family and so uses the resources and options he has open to him and clears a patch of forest to grow hill rice. His hard labour pays off and he is able to sell a small surplus. Rakoto farms rice on the valley floor. In good years, when there is plenty of water, he produces more than his family can eat. However as the forest on the slopes continues to be cut, water in the dry season is reduced, and there are fewer and fewer good years.

That tropical deforestation threatens species' survival is well known to the general public. There is also increasing awareness that it contributes to climate change (through the release of carbon stored in trees and soils). Zafy's story demonstrates that although cutting down forest is often presented as wanton destruction, it may well be a perfectly sensible choice for the people directly involved. It also shows that some negative impacts of deforestation may be felt locally as well as globally. 

In recent years a new approach to conserving tropical forests has evolved. The central idea is that those who benefit from the existence of forest should pay those who would otherwise cut it down. This concept is known as payment for ecosystem services and has come to dominate discussions about rainforest conservation. People who support this approach argue that it will benefit poor people like Zafy, who will be compensated for not clearing forest, through cash payments or development activities in their area. In addition, the land-use changes which will be encouraged under the payment schemes (protecting forest or planting new forest) may benefit other poor people in the area; for example Rakoto may benefit from increased forest cover through improved flow of water to his rice fields.

Unfortunately nothing is ever as simple as it seems. While these payments for ecosystem services schemes are attracting millions of dollars, and there is a commitment by many involved to ensure they are beneficial for poor people, questions remain both about the impact current schemes are having on the poor and about how these schemes could be designed to realise any potential for alleviating poverty while avoiding harm.

These vitally important questions need a research approach which brings together specialists with a range of expertise. Our team involves sociologists, economists, ecologists, hydrologists, remote sensing experts and modellers who will explore the complex ways in which international ecosystem service payments affect the lives of poor people. Specific questions we will address include quantifying the benefits which lowland rice farmers may expect from increasing forest cover, exploring the costs (and who bears them) of reduced access for wild-product harvesting, and investigating how politics and social structures influence how any benefits from payments are distributed. We focus on a single area (the eastern rainforests), in a single country (Madagascar). Such a narrow focus is necessary to get the complete picture which takes account of all the interactions between ecological and social systems. 

Although we focus field work within Madagascar, and our results will directly influence payment schemes in the country, our project's findings will also have a much wider impact. We are working closely with those involved in developing the policies which underpin payment schemes, and in implementing them on the ground both in Madagascar and worldwide. Our project will result in scientific papers which push the boundaries of interdisciplinary research, and interesting coverage in the media and on our project website. However through this wider engagement our project will also result in concrete changes to the design of payment schemes which should improve the lives of people like Rakoto, Zafy and their families, wherever they live in the world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research and how?
Ultimate beneficiaries: The ultimate beneficiaries most directly impacted by this project are the rural communities (often highly marginalized and poor) that live in areas where payments are being implemented.
a. There are 8 million people in Madagascar's eastern rainforest belt, 1 million of whom live in the communes surrounding Conservation International's (CI) two REDD+ pilot projects. The most direct impacts are on the 75,000 people identified across both projects as extremely poor and highly impacted. They will benefit from improved design of payment schemes (through both the land-use changes incentivized and improved equity in the distribution of payments).
b. Land-use is not only affected by the design of international payment schemes but by local institutions including forest management associations. Within the study area these will benefit from improved capacity to make informed decisions about local land-use change and negotiate with those involved in scheme design. 
c. The work will inform future payment schemes under a national REDD+ system (by influencing the national REDD+ strategy) and thus people living around all of Madagascar's forests could ultimately benefit. 
d. Results will feed into international discussions on ecosystem service payments providing benefits to rural people impacted by schemes in other parts of the tropics through improved scheme design.

Users of research:
a. National decision makers in Madagascar are eager to capitalize on the potential of ecosystem service payments for poverty alleviation. This includes those responsible for developing national REDD+ policy (e.g., Ministry of Water and Forests, the Office National pour l'Environnement) and those testing feasibility of REDD+ approaches (e.g. CI, WWF, Wildlife Conservation Society). They benefit from nuanced analysis of the impacts of policy options on poverty alleviation, communicated so as to be easily used for policy decisions.
b. The project will provide guidance on designing effective, efficient and equitable payment schemes to those involved in developing REDD+ policy globally (e.g., Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance) and implementing REDD+ schemes around the world (including CI field programs).
c. Efforts to incorporate ecosystem services into national accounts (e.g. the World Bank Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services) will benefit from estimates of the costs/benefits of land-use change. 
d. We will fill important knowledge gaps in ecosystem service linkages (see academic beneficiaries). We will improve understanding of the response of hydrological services to land-use change on the forest/agricultural frontier thus improving the WaterWorld model (a freely available tool). The new information on local ecosystem service values will feed into the Ecosystem Service Partnership's database for use in values transfer. The empirical carbon work will calibrate remote sensing data for a previously understudied habitat (regrowing tropical forest) which has wide utility in carbon assessments. We will make methodological advances in adapting environmental valuation methods developed in the west to low income country contexts.

Research Institutions in Madagascar: Poor investment has hindered the development of Malagasy research. The majority of the field research will be carried out by Malagasy researchers who will lead-author a significant number of papers, working (where helpful) in international partnerships. This strengthened capacity will make them more able to publish their research internationally (benefiting them and the research community).

Wider society: The general public (in Madagascar and internationally) will benefit from increased understanding of the linkages between ecosystem services and human wellbeing. Improved understanding empowers positive changes (e.g. through lobbying politicians).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>274465</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TV item on Malagasy National news about the p4ges project launch</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A84D8447-35C9-42E9-9912-F0B78A8D50F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>When the p4ges project was launched, the event was closely followed by the Malagasy press - here is a story which went out on the TV evening News: News clip (The broadcast was in Malagasy, the language of Madagascar)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://p4ges.org/news/video_news2.php.en</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>National advisory group discussion about p4ges impacts</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>012E2050-C537-4E74-A15D-CE8A1A1B8028</gtr:id><gtr:impact>After the formal policy-focused close event of p4ges (attended by 2 ministers), the leaders of p4ges had a meeting with our National Advisory Committee.

It is chaired by Mme Claudine Ramiarison (Ministry of Research and Higher Education). We had a really helpful discussion about the next steps for ensuring p4ges research is as available as possible to be used. One thing which was agreed was to put p4ges papers and archived data sets on the ONE website. We also agreed that the carbon data will be shared immediately with the national REDD+ office to be integrated into their current work on establishing the national Reference Emission Level [this has since been done].

Mme Claudine closed the event by commenting on how impressed she was by the quality of the research conducted by p4ges and that she hopes to see the collaborations which have been developed, continue into the future as this is a very important area for Madagascar.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://p4ges.org/news/close-sharing.php.en</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>National stakeholder event (Andasibe site)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9523744F-998D-4CC0-8141-DFA144DB6A4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>More than 45 people including the British Ambassador, the regional Director of Forests, the regional Director of Rural Development, representatives of the Office National pour l'Environnement and NGOs visited our field site in Andasibe to discuss some of the research results p4ges has generated so far, to visit our intensely instrumented hydrological plots and to discuss some of the likely future scenarios of land use for us to explore in our modelling.

The event was very well attended with standing room only in ESSA's largest lecture theatre.

We had a table loaded with various outputs from the projects including summaries of many of our published papers (in English and French) and the project summary booklet which our guests really appreciated.

The event was chaired by Dr Patrick Ranjatson and opened with and introduction to the project from the project lead Prof Julia Jones from Bangor University. Following this, Dr Ramboazanaka Murielle, the Director of research for the University of Antananarivo, Dr Rabemananjara Zo, the head of Water and Forest department and Prof Bruno Ramamonjisoa, Director of the Ecole Sup&amp;eacute;rieure des Sciences Agronomiques each gave a short speech to put the conference in context.

Dr Ranjatson explained that we had chosen to focus the event on three branches of our research in detail rather than trying to cover everything. However he pointed people to the summaries of our papers for more information.

The first presentation was by Riana Hary Andrisoa (LRI) and was on 'Caron stock surveys I the framework of poverty alleviation in Madagascar: challenges and results'. She presented the very impressive work carried out by LRI during the p4ges project to quantify all five carbon pools (including the 'hidden' below ground pools) across the range of land uses in the swidden agricultural cycle. She emphasised the challenges that the very large stocks of carbon in these hidden pools poses for monitoring and evaluation of REDD+

This was followed by a presentation by Alexandra Rasoamanana (ESSA) looking at 'Who bears the cost of forest conservation in Madagascar?' which was a detailed economic analysis of the magnitude and distribution of opportunity costs of conservation and the magnitude and distribution of compensation under the World Bank social safeguard system.

Finally, Tokihenintsoa Andrianjohaninarivo (CI) continued with the social theme, with an excellent presentation 'Can small scale livelihood projects help contribute to both sustainable development and forest conservation outcomes?' This looked at local perceptions of the range of micro-development projects which have been implements around the CAZ corridor in the context of conservation and the REDD+ pilot project and discussed their role in delivering livelihood benefits and in reducing deforestation.

The talks were followed by a very lively discussion session with questions from researchers from many institutions. The debates continued over an open air reception on the lawn of the Ecole Sup&amp;eacute;rieure des Science Agronomiques.

Dr Ramboazanaka Murielle, the Director of research for the University said in her closing comments: &amp;quot;Congratulations to the team for such excellent and useful research.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://p4ges.org/news/sharing-madagascar.php.en</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Regional events to share results with policy makers, local authorities and other key stakeholders</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78A07035-7FDB-4B26-BD07-910FA24FCF95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We ran two major events to feedback results to our regional stakeholders (some key national stakeholders also attended such as the national coordinator of REDD+ in Madagascar). After two and a half challenging years of field work and data processing it has been satisfying to start sharing our results with local communities (other enteries) that we have been working with but also to potential users of our results in positions of authority in the regions where we worked. 

Two regional events were organised in Moramanga and Toamasina; the two cities which are the focus points of partners and organizations working on conservation and development around the Corridor Ankeniheny Zahamena. The aims were to share and to inform our results to all regional stakeholders such as local representatives of government and relevant ministries, local authorities (mayors), NGOs working on development and conservation, private sector partners (the Ambatovy mine), local associations and others sectors in the region. We were also delighted that three members of our national advisory committee also attended: Jean Noel Ndriamiary, Mamitiana Randriamanjato and Andriamandranto Ravoahangy. There were in total about 70 participants at the Moramanga event and 50 at the one held in Toamasina.

After giving a general presentation of the overall project, the biophysical team emphasised the impact of different land use change on ecosystem services. Their research shows that some ecosystem services are rapidly lost (and not easily rebuilt) when forests are converted (through clearance for agriculture) whereas others are quite well retained in fallows, especially tree fallows. They showed that reforestation can rebuild some ecosystem services and also provide jobs (but data on whether active replanting or just controlling fire and grazing is more efficient is not yet available).

The next session was mainly focused on the effect of forest conservation on the local communities. P4ges has demonstrated that conservation projects can have negative effects on the local livelihoods as they are heavily dependent on swidden agriculture and few alternatives exist. There have been around 600 micro-development projects implemented in CAZ since 2006, under different forms, which can ideally compensate for these costs by allowing alternative livelihoods. While these are vital for the success of conservation and its local acceptability and are greatly appreciated, some improvements need to be made with implementation in some areas. Microprojects carried out as part of the social safeguards (implemented explicitly to avoid impacts of conservation) need better targeting to ensure the poorest people wouldn't suffer because of conservation and to make sure that the compensation project would reach the people truly affected by the conservation project (see here for a paper on this subject published in Global Environmental Change).

The session was followed by some recommendations and discussions from the audience. There was a lively discussion about the main issues of implementing safeguard project like the identification of the beneficiaries. There was also a deep discussion about the issue of land tenure which is currently complex and mostly not formalised. Many of the attendees feel tenure needs to be regulated if schemes such as REDD+ or forest conservation more broadly are to be effective.

The participants showed a big interest in our results; they were very engaged in discussions. The Prefect of the Alaotra Mangoro region, Rakotondrasoa Daniel said &amp;quot;the regional event was very useful for practioners to learn new things and improve the way of managing the forest. I encourage more researchers to communicate their finding in this way&amp;quot;.

The Regional Development Director of Alaotra Mangoro, Rabenasolo Zakamalala said &amp;quot;The results from the project would help the police makers to take the right decisions ensuring a sustainable management of protected areas, local and regional development.&amp;quot;

The Mayor of Ambodimangavalo, representing the voice of the lowest level of administration and remote areas along the protected area, emphasised that it was important that benefits from REDD+ reach remote areas (as they tend to be forgotten but have big needs). The national coordinator of REDD+ in Madagascar Mamitiana Randriamanjato also said that a well-designed project that meets official standards is not enough unless the benefits from conservation reach the right people.

Sam Mwangi from the espa directorate suggested a role play between the State (who are the main deciders) and other stakeholders. The aim of the game was to make people understand that it is not easy to make decisions and to choose the right way by considering the voice of different stakeholders. This helped us all to understand how the state and other all institutions should collaborate to ensure the effectiveness of conservation and development projects in improving local community livelihoods.

Many actors present said they looked forward to the full report of the work (some of the results are still preliminaries). The national project coordinator in Madagascar Bruno Ramamonjisoa mentioned that there will be a national event to present final results in Antananarivo at the end of January 2017.

While Sam Mwangi, the ESPA impact advisor in Africa, was in Madagascar, he has spent time with p4ges team to discuss deeply the impact of the project and advise us on how to improve our impact. He, met all institutions involved in the project at the national level; visiting each partner in turn. He also had the opportunity to come to the field briefly when we returned to one of our pilot sites: Mahatsara, to return research results. He met the president of the fokontany and some local people and saw how we share our research results in the community. He also visited the maternity hospital in Andasibe where some of our equipment has a new lease of life providing light. Sam Mwangi said &amp;quot;P4ges project is the first ESPA project in Africa who is doing feedback to communities.&amp;quot; He also mentioned that &amp;quot;the scientists always want to do research but communities want development. So, research for development is a good thing&amp;quot;. The local and regional feedback has shown that sharing and discussing our results locally is the starting point to turn on research into use which can eventually lead to development impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://p4ges.org/news/stakeholder-results.php.en</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy briefs</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>45FBDBE5-6966-4F8A-96E1-229B21CEC67B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have produced policy briefs (in English and French) covering the main findings of all pf p4ges papers which are so far published or in press.

A total of 30 participants included representatives from the Ministry of Water, Ministry of Environment and Forests, university departments, ministry of finance and local and international conservation (WWF, Conservation International, WCS) and development-focused organisations.

The workshop included presentations on specific developments of the WaterWorld and Co$tingNature ES tools for Madagascar and the CAZ and participants were trained on how to use both of these tools. For WaterWorld participants carried out a baseline assessment and explored the implications of a business as usual deforestation scenario for the CAZ. For Co$tingNature, participants assessed a baseline analysis for the whole of Madagascar focusing on analysing spatial and temporal trade-offs in ES provision.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blog.policysupport.org/2017/01/using-waterworld-and-coting-nature-to.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Co$ting Nature and WaterWorld training course</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6AD6669-1308-492C-B5AE-547E171FCAB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 13th February 2014, in Antananarivo, Madagascar the ESPA-funded p4ges (Can paying for global ecosystem services reduce poverty?) project delivered a training course in freely available policy-support tools for assessing baseline ecosystem services and the impacts of scenarios on ecosystem service flows: WaterWorld and Co$ting Nature. The 25 trainees included staff from the Ministry of Water among other local government ministries, university departments and the Office National pour l'Environnment. Local and international conservation (WWF, Conservation International, WCS) and development-focused (WaterAid, EU-DEV) organisations were also represented in significant numbers.

The training was introduced by Dr Luciano Andriamaro (head of science at Conservation International) and Dr Rija Ranaivoarison from the world bank WAVES programme. There was great interest in the tools, so much so that the planned 2 hours session ran to 3 hours and the participants all requested that we run further training to allow them to get deeper into the tools. Jean Roger Rakotoarijaona from the office national pour l'environnment (ONE) said 'These sort of tools are very useful for us in planning further investment in REDD+ at the national scale. I will encourage my colleagues to attend further training and look into this in more detail'.

The training involved the participants running baseline analyses for northern Madagascar with Co$ting Nature and a baseline and land use change scenario using WaterWorld. The WaterWorld examined the potential impacts of a deforestation scenario on annual water flows in the country. The image below shows areas in which such a scenario of continued forest loss outside of protected areas would lead to reductions in river water flows.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://p4ges.org/news/Markmulliganreport.php.en</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy focused event to share results</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D676A34-BB4F-4F8D-8874-31801290C997</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On the 27th January p4ges held an event to share the most policy-relevant results from the p4ges project with government, NGO and donor community who are involved in shaping and implementing policy surrounding forest conservation, restoration and REDD+ in Madagascar.

We were extremely honoured that the event was attended by two ministers of state: Mme Johannita Ndahimananjara from the Ministry of Environment, Ecology and Forests, and Mme Monique Rasoazananera from the Ministry of Research and Higher Education. Both ministers gave excellent opening speeches. Mme Dahimananjara reminded us of the importance of the environment for underpinning human development-using the recent water and hydro power shortages in Madagascar to emphasise this point. Mme Rasoazananera emphasised the importance of research for evidence-based policy making and stressing the value of research on current pressing issues such as linkages between the environment and poverty.

Julia Jones (Bangor University), Julie Razafimanahaka (Madagasikara Voakajy), Herintsitohaina Razakamanarivo (Laboratoire des Radio-Isotopes-University of Antananarivo) and Luciano Andriamaro (Conservation International) presented the context of the project and key research findings. Bruno Ramamonjisoa (University of Antananarivo) then led a dynamic discussion focusing on the main lessons which could be learnt for the current policy processes in Madagascar.

We gave all our visitors copies of policies briefs in French and English which summarised the 10 papers we have already published in international journals. We also gave them copies of our local communication booklet and flash disks containing all of this and lots more (e.g. training materials for the policy support tools Co$ting Nature and Water World).

The very engaged audience asked may excellent questions across the full range of p4ges research and from a range of perspective. There were technical questions about the hydrological modelling carried out and the extent to which these models can be used by others (we were able to confirm that the models are freely available and training materials are available on our website and the flash disk distributed). There was a lot of interest in our hydrological research which is seen as particularly timely given the current water shortages in Madagascar and the recent ministerial announcement about the importance of significant restoration of degraded land in Madagascar.

Another area which attracted a lot of discussion was the question of costs of conservation and the lessons which could be taken from this research for the development of the new social safeguards for the national REDD+ strategy in Madagascar (which is currently being developed).

There was also an active debate about the importance of considering the hidden carbon pools (those in soil) in REDD+ monitoring and evaluation and the challenges that this presents. The p4ges carbon team presented their science which shows that these pools appear to be retained to some extent in cleared land and this needs to be considered in REDD+ policy at the landscape scale. National policies around sustainable agricultural production interlock here with climate change mitigation and related policies and soil ecosystem services are of central importance to both.

The event was closed by Sally Harrison from the British Embassy (representing the British government as the funding for p4ges came from the UK). Sally emphasised the UK and Madagascar's commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals and echoed Mme Rasoazananera (the Minister of Higher Education and Research) comments on the importance of evidence and research for making the best possible policy decisions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://p4ges.org/news/close-sharing.php.en</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>English language booklet summarising p4ges research</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8DDCA5D7-5FBD-4D3F-8535-24B49FB11BBB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have printed 100 of our Nalagasy language booklets (there are 4000 in Malagasy) in english.These booklets (which we produced with a local cartoonist) cover all the main findings of the p4ges project but in simple form.

Our local assistants played a really vital role in explaining the research to our guests. This was very successful: &amp;quot;Not meaning to be rude but to be honest people don't believe researchers and vazaha [foreigners]. What is good is that it is people from here who have explained to us what they have seen every day in terms of differences in the amount of water entering the drums in the different sites. This makes everything very clear. This is very convincing. This needs to be shared more widely.&amp;quot; Bruno Rakotomalala (school teacher from Ampangalatsary).

We had so many excellent questions-some quite technical focusing on the research, but many taking a wider perspective. There was a real focus on what people locally could do and there was deep and detailed discussion on this topic between the guests as they walked around the site.

This grant (NE/K010085/1 now NE/K010085/2) is part of a consortium project 'Can paying for global ecosystem services reduce poverty? www.p4ges.org'. We operate in very close partnership with the other four components of this consortium and it is difficult to assign many of our impact-related activities to a single component grant of the consortium.

We are now in the final stages of error checking data, re-analysing, and writing up.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>24508462-7B45-4EAC-A401-380A25A8E0D4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.p4ges.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1C4B245D-C5D1-478A-BDC2-2BFCEEA58F78"><gtr:id>1C4B245D-C5D1-478A-BDC2-2BFCEEA58F78</gtr:id><gtr:title>Research ethics: Assuring anonymity at the individual level may not be sufficient to protect research participants from harm</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biological Conservation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/843429b2d8a3ee3a0d3c2844a815f050"><gtr:id>843429b2d8a3ee3a0d3c2844a815f050</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>John F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/K010085/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>FBD4801B-211C-43A1-906C-9DC6F75DE426</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/K010085/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>274465.69</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>4F9B50EF-13B7-4F2E-904C-BDEE4ABCC1C1</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/K010085/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>73084.93</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2018-01-14</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5020ECC8-E0E8-434D-BDD5-663A9C04EFA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BFE597D-D128-481A-A949-5847F619966F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A5240626-9660-4BCA-A8F1-528736D7026E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D4F391DF-BCE0-47FA-BED7-78025F16B14D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hydrological Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
