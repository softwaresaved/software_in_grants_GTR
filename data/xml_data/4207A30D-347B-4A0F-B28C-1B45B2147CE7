&lt;p>This debate has become hugely significant in the UK with the current coalition government?s ambitions to rebalance the UK economy sectorally and spatially. The debate raises several key questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>what is the current contribution of UK cities to national economic competiveness&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how do they compare with their competitors internationally&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>what is their potential to increase their economic contribution in future? &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This study will answer these questions by analysing a series of databases on city regions? economic performance created by ONS, Eurostat, OECD, and DG Regio. It will focus upon the impact of the current recession upon the performance and prospects of UK cities in national and international contexts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will examine recent datasets, to compare the economic performance of UK city-regions with their European and international counterparts. We will focus on key performance measures such as GDP, labour market and demographic trends and on indicators of the drivers of competitiveness - innovation, skills, economic diversity and connectivity. Our focus is principally on the 2000-10 decade, allowing us to explore developments before and during the current economic crisis.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Institute is committed to engaging the policy community in and maximising the impact of all its research. We would draw up a programme of activities with potential users to increase understanding of the issues and involve them in shaping, implementing and communicating our research programme and results.

Who - key stakeholders
The project results would interest a wide range of partners and actors involved in the economic competiveness of UK cities. All would benefit from understanding more about the relative performance of UK cities, their standing in the European and wider global marketplace, the relative impact of the recession and the critical urban success factors underpinning city region performance that the project would identify. The stakeholders would include: 

At European and wider global level:
- European Commission (DG Regio) and OECD;
- EUROCITIES, Committee of the Regions, INTA, CEMR.

At UK level: 
- the Minster for Cities and officials in the Cabinet Office, Departments of Communities and Local Government, Transport, Work and Pensions, Education, Business Innovation and Skills and the Treasury; 
 - individual local authorities and representative organisations like the Local Government Association, the Core Cities and Local Enterprise Partnerships;
- professional bodies like British Property Federation, the CBI, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, Housebuilders Federation; 
- voluntary and community sector representative bodies like NCVO and ACEVO; 
- research organisations and think tanks like the Centre for Cities.

How - website, newsletters, media releases, conference papers journal publications, workshops 

We will set up an interactive website. We will produce a series of pamphlets and newsletters at key stages of the project. We will promote the results widely in a range of outlets, including academic journals. We will attract extensive media coverage since we have good contacts with them and the topic is central to the current political debate about rebalancing the UK economy. We will publicise our results at national and international conferences. We will make a series of presentations to senior policy makers in central and local government. We would hold three workshops in London with them during the project: (i) to seek their support at the outset, (ii) to present emerging findings and (iii) to publicise the final evidence, analysis and policy messages. We would use our contacts with the Core Cities, the Centre for Cities, OECD, European Commission and EUROCITIES to disseminate our research within the policy community throughout the life of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>129728</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>38000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Department for Business, Innovation and Skills</gtr:department><gtr:description>Mapping Local Comparative Advantages in Innovation</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of the UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C958EA6C-FE7F-49A4-B356-80D21DC9E2B6</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>60000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Spatial Economic Audit for the Liverpool City Region</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Liverpool</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>01715310-76C3-45F9-9882-BE812BD9BD15</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our research findings have been used beyond academia by national and local politicians and policy-makers and reported in national media.

The findings have been used for example by:

? The Minister for Cities, Greg Clark, and his team in the Cabinet Office. The Minister presented some of our findings in his presentation to the 'Universities UK 2014 Annual Conference' for example.
? The English Core Cities network to promote its city-regional devolution agenda and specifically through a discussion paper, widely published and circulated on the role of cities in national economic performance titled 'No cities, no civilisation; no successful cities, no successful nations'. 
? The Core Cities Vice-Chair (for Growth) also cited the research in his Opening Address to the Core Cities 2014 Business Summit (12 September, 2014).
? Liverpool city-region Local Enterprise Partnership to develop its economic development strategy. 
? Belfast City Council in a report aimed at encouraging greater investment in the Belfast City Region ('Investing in Belfast for Greater Northern Ireland Prosperity: How and Why it Must Happen' (Belfast City Council, October 2014).

To help maximise impact we directly engaged with policy-makers. We circulated draft reports for comment to a core group of stakeholders comprising the Cities Policy Unit, Cabinet Office, Core Cities, DG-Regio, European Commission, Unit for Regional Growth and Policies, OECD, Chief Executive's Office, Liverpool City Council and Liverpool City Region Local Enterprise Partnership. 

We then printed and circulated a 200-page report ('UK city-regions in growth and recession: How are they performing at home and abroad?' Available at https://db.tt/vwE292Cy) to a circulation list of some 90 stakeholders including national and local politicians and policymakers, Local Enterprise Partnerships, academics, policy research institutes and the media.

Along with other members of the 'Economic performance, Policy and Management' Research Cluster of the Secondary Data Analysis Initiative, we presented the research findings to a group of policymakers at a Workshop convened by the Cluster Leader ('Using Secondary Data Analysis to Research Economic Performance', NIESR, London, 24 June 2014).

We also presented the findings at 16 national and international Conferences attended by policy-makers and practitioners as well as academic researchers.

Our research attracted some media coverage and notably a lead article based on it in the Financial Times ('Proximity to London helps cities prosper', 7 May, 2014). 

The findings were also used as background context for a BBC programme on the relative performance of the Belfast and Northern Ireland economies ('Game of Thrones boost to economy in Northern Ireland', 11 May 2014).

Our research has also informed subsequent policy-related work. For example we used our city-region typology in research for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on 'Mapping Local Comparative Advantages in Innovation'. 

We are continuing to generate analysis, outputs and presentations, based on work done during the project's lifespan and we continue with our dissemination. We are confident that this will continue to influence the policy dialogue about urban policy and cities after the next General Election.

The work has continued to be influential in policy making circles. In particular the evidence about the economic recovery of Liverpool city region (LCR) has led into further research about the city region which led to the publication of the State of the Liverpool City Region report. It was extensively used in for example the development of the LCR Local Enterprise Partnership Growth Strategy. Presentations have been given to senior Civil servants in CLG and BEIS and to LCR Combined Authority. We have given international lectures on these themes in Korea, Germany, and Romania. The lead author of the project Michael Parkinson was made Citizen of Honour for his work on regeneration in Liverpool. Michael Parkinson was also recruited by the University of Liverpool to be its Associate Pro Vice Chancellor for civic engagement which has again emphasised the public impact of this research and project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CC25434D-9015-46D0-948C-49B1A1709CC6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6CAD9FBF-4E29-4DD7-98B0-DEB9C4EC86AB"><gtr:id>6CAD9FBF-4E29-4DD7-98B0-DEB9C4EC86AB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The State of the Liverpool City Region Report</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8418ff01ae5533cd2b6776aaca2b0cb5"><gtr:id>8418ff01ae5533cd2b6776aaca2b0cb5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parkinson M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/87B9F82F-534E-4A08-B3DF-35EB953C0F74"><gtr:id>87B9F82F-534E-4A08-B3DF-35EB953C0F74</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping Local Comparative Advantages in Innovation: framework and indicators</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b5c1023bb06747beb34a2f28b058f6db"><gtr:id>b5c1023bb06747beb34a2f28b058f6db</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E71E77D3-A795-4712-A212-95B99A947337"><gtr:id>E71E77D3-A795-4712-A212-95B99A947337</gtr:id><gtr:title>No Cities, No Civilisation;
