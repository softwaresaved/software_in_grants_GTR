A widely used moving target detection strategy for moving platforms is that of space-time adaptive processing (STAP). STAP is now readily applied to the case of a sideways-looking array, where the majority of the clutter occurs along a narrow ridge, which crosses the angle-Doppler graph diagonally. When the array orientation is at an angle (termed the crab angle) to the direction of platform motion, the clutter at a given range no longer occupies the diagonal ridge, but an ellipse. The eccentricity of the ellipse decreases as the crab angle increases, so that when the array is forward-facing with respect to the platform motion, clutter forms a circle on the angle-Doppler plot. It is far more difficult for the STAP to compensate for this clutter because it is now range dependant. As such, ground clutter is range ambiguous, and the clutter arcs at different ranges and angles can interfere with the detection and tracking of targets. Thus the performance of the radar is reduced because of the increased clutter power competing with the target's signal. Current research has concentrated on altering the STAP architecture to cope with the range dependent returns. However, there is already a mechanism which can help mitigate the Doppler-range ambiguities, but which is not used in the adaptive part of the STAP architecture. This, of course, is the matched filter and its ambiguity function. There has been increasing interest in adaptive waveform design in radar research recently, and optimizing the transmitted waveform for the environment has shown to be effective in a number of areas. The aim of the adaptivity proposed for this STAP situation is to reduce the clutter power competing with any target signals which may be present. The waveform design can achieve this by ensuring that the matched filter response to the waveform with an applied Doppler shift is low at the range of the target of interest. This will have the effect of increasing the target power with respect to the competing clutter, and therefore the detection probability of moving targets. The research we propose here is to develop methods to efficiently and adaptively design the transmitted waveform based on the received signals. The study will encompass the use of the received signals, prior knowledge of target and clutter locations, and spatial beam pattern of the array on transmit and receive, in designing the signal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>110864</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Defence Science &amp; Technology Laboratory (DSTL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ministry of Defence/ Defence Science and Technology Lab</gtr:description><gtr:id>5B557A4F-B998-46AC-B437-E409E959D33C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We developed a demo and software.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>We have received the Bright Sapphire Synthetic Aperture radar (SAR) dataset from Dr Carolyn Winkworth from DSTL, and subsequently have been in contact with DSTL with regard to some data-reading MATLAB codes, and collaboration on the data.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The work was carried out under University Defence Research Centre Phase 1 and collaborated with Defence Science and Technology Lab members.

Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is often employed to detect these targets, though in the case of forward-looking radar (FLR) the clutter Doppler characteristics become taxing due to its range dependence and high rank, which resultantly severely degrades the target detection performance. 

The aim of this project is to apply novel radar processing in order to help overcome the problems facing FLR. The main research objective is to incorporate the transmit side of the radar into the adaptive processing which is not a practice at present. Adaptivity within this functional block can take the form of transmit signal and pulse coding design and beampattern design.

Key Findings


1) The concept of space-time illumination patterns was reviewed and found to work nearly as well as conventional receiver processing, but simply transfers the processing burden from the receiver to the transmitter which has several disadvantages. We identified the possibility that space-time illumination patterns (STIPs) could be used to augment training data azimuth-range bin returns to improve the estimation of clutter statistics. 

2) It has been shown theoretically that full Doppler compensation based on the geometry of the airborne scenario which is performed on transmit will reduce the upper bound on the rank of the sample covariance matrix. Convex numerical procedures which can be solved in polynomial time have been developed to design the required beampattern. However, it was found that in practice the effect of augmenting the beampattern in this way while maintaining a sufficient mainbeam power is to raise the transmit sidelobes. This is actually detrimental to the rank of the sample covariance matrix, and therefore reduces performance. 

3) Developed a transmit strategy for use with planar forward-looking arrays which alleviates the problem of range-ambiguous (vertical) sidelobe clutter. A low complexity optimisation strategy is developed to form an elevation null over a range of elevation angles. For planar arrays this is shown to have a very low complexity form, only requiring optimisation over the number of vertical elements in the array. The problem is solved through a second order cone program optimisation, and the results show significantly reduced clutter power and reduced heterogeneity (clutter rank) at the receiver. The benefit of performing this clutter cancellation at the transmit side is that it leaves the full dimensionality available at the receiver for target detection, which is significant because it has been shown that forward-looking planar array performance is improved by the application of 3D STAP.

4) We have been further investigating the beampattern design principle for improving clutter homogeneity. Due to previous conclusions about transmit beampattern design, we focussed on joint transmit-receiver processing to attain performance improvements. Receiver processing has been shown to improve homogeneity to a large degree, and we therefore expect to improve on this through transmit illumination design. We have developed expressions for the clutter covariance matrix in terms of the transmit and receiver weight vectors, and defined an optimisation problem to improve homogeneity. The problem was non-convex, and we therefore used iterative methods to solve the optimisation problem.

5) We have developed a transmit strategy for use with planar forward-looking arrays which alleviates the problem of range-ambiguous (vertical) sidelobe clutter. A low complexity optimisation strategy is developed to form an elevation null over a range of elevation angles. For planar arrays this is shown to have a very low complexity form, only requiring optimisation over $N_E$ values, where $N_E$ is the number of vertical elements in the array. Work submitted and accepted to SSPD 2011 [1].

The beampattern design principle for ambiguous range nulling on transmit has been explored further. A minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR)-type closed form solution to the problem has been developed, and the problem has been extended to the more general 2D beampattern case. Further, we have developed low complexity FFT-based procedures for estimation of the ambiguous clutter regions when there are uncertainties in the scenario geometry (for example due to an unknown platform motion vector). The performance improvements available from the beampattern design procedure was evaluated via simulation on the MATLAB testbed in terms of the improvement factor and the detection performance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The use of transmit beamforming for improvement of clutter homogeneity is novel. The elevation beampattern design is a new concept for STAP, and the joint use of transmit-receive beamforming is a new idea which has been shown to provide significant benefits and can be used in Aerospace, defence, Marine and any transports using forward looking radar. 

We foresee the ideas which have been initiated here to be applicable also to bistatic radar configurations, where the clutter homogeneity problem due to platform motion is significantly more difficult.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6BB21D15-6155-4F21-8122-F8B8879A6789</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CE524AE8-01CB-4033-9C1D-96C2D660144A"><gtr:id>CE524AE8-01CB-4033-9C1D-96C2D660144A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Beampattern optimisation for sub-arrayed MIMO radar for large arrays</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a"><gtr:id>312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilcox D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4244-5127-2</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A817CFC1-51A3-47B7-89E0-2013D5A3CED1"><gtr:id>A817CFC1-51A3-47B7-89E0-2013D5A3CED1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Distribution of the Ratio of the Largest Eigenvalue to the Trace of Complex Wishart Matrices</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/45d75dce693154c859e395bfc58b35c6"><gtr:id>45d75dce693154c859e395bfc58b35c6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kortun A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D217081D-F5B7-4CE6-B003-DF0BB9AC7A21"><gtr:id>D217081D-F5B7-4CE6-B003-DF0BB9AC7A21</gtr:id><gtr:title>On MIMO Radar Subarrayed Transmit Beamforming</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a"><gtr:id>312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilcox D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FFCA859E-BC5A-44A7-9EAB-56BC76F2AE6C"><gtr:id>FFCA859E-BC5A-44A7-9EAB-56BC76F2AE6C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Maximum likelihood sub-arrayed MIMO radar receiver</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a"><gtr:id>312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilcox D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-84919-617-8</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FF9C85FE-511C-4392-980E-9078E138CC8C"><gtr:id>FF9C85FE-511C-4392-980E-9078E138CC8C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transmit beamforming for range ambiguous clutter mitigation in forward-looking STAP radar</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a"><gtr:id>312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilcox D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/13C98392-E1FA-4983-9129-526F93756902"><gtr:id>13C98392-E1FA-4983-9129-526F93756902</gtr:id><gtr:title>Resolution of two point targets using sub-arrayed MIMO radar</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a"><gtr:id>312c2dab1af467725e15be31d3ae576a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilcox D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4244-5811-0</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H012257/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
