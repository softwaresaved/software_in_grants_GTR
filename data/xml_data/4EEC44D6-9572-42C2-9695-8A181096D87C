This is an attentional disorder that commonly arises after stroke, causing sufferers to act as if one half of their visual world is missing. Symptoms include bumping into objects, leaving food on one side of the plate, and failing to notice people on the affected side. Aside from these debilitating effects, the condition strongly predicts the rate at which individuals recover from the other symptoms of stroke. Many individuals who show hemi-spatial neglect at hospital admission still struggle with daily routine years later. The current treatment provides little relief. 
Our new approach involves passing tiny electrical currents through the part of the scalp that lies just behind the ears. The currents are too small to cause discomfort, but stimulate nerve pathways that project from the inner ear to those parts of the brain that are damaged. Unlike the current treatment which requires specialist staff and space, stimulation can be applied by a nurse at bedside with no technical expertise and at whatever time is convenient for the patient. More so, the apparatus can be cheaply miniaturised for personal use at home, reducing hospital stay and saving on the need to travel to clinic. 
A major drawback of our treatment is that the beneficial effects disappear as soon as stimulation is stopped. We need to find a way of triggering effects that last for much longer. Other kinds of neuro-stimulation are most effective when repeatedly applied across 5-10 days, inducing gains in stroke survivors that last for many weeks. Our own pilot data, albeit very preliminary, suggests that the same pattern holds for the new technique described here. A larger, properly controlled study is now needed to confirm this observation. Compellingly, other types of neuro-disability including aspects of dementia also recede during vestibular stimulation, so if lasting recovery is shown here then other types of patient might also be expected to benefit. 
We plan to recruit 60 individuals with hemi-spatial neglect from the East Kent Neuro-Rehabilitation Service to receive both 10 days of stimulation and then several follow-up sessions a few weeks later. These follow-ups will tell us whether lasting improvement has occurred, enabling us to determine if the technique might be relevant to rehabilitative practice. If so, then we will begin further trials with a miniature device that is currently undergoing validation by a downstream commerical collaborator.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Hemi-spatial neglect is a debilitating, attentional disorder that is difficult to treat. Sufferers behave as if one side of their visual world (usually the left) is missing, often colliding with obstacles and failing to acknowledge people on their affected side. The condition significantly lengthens hospital stay and is the strongest predictor of general functional recovery from stroke. We need funds to pilot a potentially more effective and cost-saving treatment based on painless, non-invasive stimulation of the vestibular nerves. These nerves convey information from the balance organs to parts of the brain involved in spatial attention. While a single session of stimulation provides immediate relief from the symptoms of neglect, these resurface shortly after stimulation is stopped. The present study will tell us whether repeated, daily sessions induce longer-lasting relief that could have relevance to rehabilitative practice. 60 individuals with hemi-spatial neglect will receive either 1, 5 or 10 sessions of stimulation and then undergo testing several weeks later to establish whether lasting remission has occurred. We need to show ?proof of carry-over? before a more controlled investigation of efficacy can proceed, and further development can occur on an inexpensive, portable device that is suitable for self-administration.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>251001</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Neuro-rehabilitation Service</gtr:department><gtr:description>East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C81CA96-F26D-4589-ACF4-7FEC4184E868</gtr:id><gtr:impact>(1) PMID: 22483722 (Multi-disciplinary: Medicine/Neuroscience/Psychology/Rehabilitation)

Abstract
Hemi-spatial neglect is an attentional disorder in which the sufferer fails to acknowledge or respond to stimuli appearing in contralesional space. In recent years, it has become clear that a measurable reduction in contralesional neglect can occur during galvanic vestibular stimulation, a technique by which transmastoid, small amplitude current induces lateral, attentional shifts via asymmetric modulation of the left and right vestibular nerves. However, it remains unclear whether this reduction persists after stimulation is stopped. To estimate longevity of effect, we therefore conducted a double-blind, randomized, dose-response trial involving a group of stroke patients suffering from left-sided neglect (n = 52, mean age = 66 years). To determine whether repeated sessions of galvanic vestibular stimulation more effectively induce lasting relief than a single session, participants received 1, 5, or 10 sessions, each lasting 25 min, of sub-sensory, left-anodal right-cathodal noisy direct current (mean amplitude = 1 mA). Ninety five percent confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment arms showed a statistically significant improvement between the pre-stimulation baseline and the final day of stimulation on the primary outcome measure, the conventional tests of the Behavioral Inattention Test. More remarkably, this change (mean change = 28%, SD = 18) was still evident 1 month later. Secondary analyses indicated an allied increase of 20% in median Barthel Index (BI) score, a measure of functional capacity, in the absence of any adverse events or instances of participant non-compliance. Together these data suggest that galvanic vestibular stimulation, a simple, cheap technique suitable for home-based administration, may produce lasting reductions in neglect that are clinically important. Further protocol optimization is now needed ahead of a larger effectiveness study.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>downstream development planning to gain regulatory compliance for their mobile GVS device</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>downstream development planning to gain regulatory compliance for their mobile GVS device</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scion NeuroStim</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Scion Neurostim</gtr:description><gtr:id>134CA12F-DF82-4D2B-B4D3-D4C73613765C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wilkinson DT, Morris R, Milberg W et al.

We are now preparing a new funding application to the MRC to support a second round of protocol optimisation prior to a much larger effectiveness study.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F6A4B0DD-12B4-45A5-8FD4-A02E2BB5FC19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ninety five percent confidence intervals (n=52) indicated that all three treatment arms showed a statistically significant improvement between the pre-stimulation baseline and the final day of stimulation on the primary outcome measure, the conventional tests of the Behavioural Inattention Test. This change (mean change=28%, SD=18) was still evident 1month later. Secondary analyses indicated an allied increase of 20% in median Barthel Index score, a measure of functional capacity, in the absence of any adverse events or instances of participant non-compliance. Together these data suggest that galvanic vestibular stimulation, a simple, cheap technique suitable for home-based administration, may produce lasting reductions in neglect that are clinically important. Further protocol optimization is now needed ahead of a larger effectiveness study.</gtr:impact><gtr:stage>Early clinical assessment</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Actively seeking support</gtr:status><gtr:title>Does repeated vestibular stimulation induce lasting recovery from hemi-spatial neglect?</gtr:title><gtr:type>Therapeutic Intervention - Medical Devices</gtr:type><gtr:ukcrnIsctnId>UKCRN 10505</gtr:ukcrnIsctnId><gtr:url>http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/Search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=10505</gtr:url><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2012</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>The device is currently under going FDA/MHRA CE approval for use as a neuro-stimulation treatment for various neurological diseases</gtr:description><gtr:id>240CEECE-7519-411B-8EB7-EB30C969DADD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>currently under-going FDA/MHRA CE marking trial in UK and USA

HSN is a debilitating, neurological disorder in which the sufferer fails to perceive stimuli on one side of space. Common symptoms involve failing to notice people on the affected side, becoming lost, bumping into objects, and failing to groom or wash parts of the body. The condition is estimated to affect one half of all stroke survivors, and is the strongest predictor of long-term disability post-stroke, significantly prolonging length of inpatient stay and increasing the need for assisted living after discharge. The established method of diagnosing HSN is the Behavioural Inattention Test, a paper and pencil test. Unfortunately, this is time-consuming, requires technical expertise to administer, is open to subjective interpretation, and must be conducted within a dedicated quiet room. Clinicians and hospital managers tell us that a quicker and cheaper means of diagnosis is needed that can be more easily integrated into standard, routine assessment. Our proposed Apple iPad application will meet this need. A working prototype has already been constructed and is now ready to undergo clinical validation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>25C67499-1AC6-44E6-A270-10EEE5461E18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>still under
