The program involves members of the department at all levels, from taught undergraduate and postgraduate students, research students, post doctorial researchers and faculty. We have a wide range of practical activities available to take out to local schools, which are boxed up with a detailed lesson plan for department members to take to take out or use on site. The majority of our outreach activities are linked to our research.
Our annual reach is to 5,000 students per year, working with approximately 800 primary school students, 3500 secondary student, and 700 A-level students, in addition to the 2,000 members of the general public that experience our events. We currently run 130 events per year, reaching school and college students at 60 different schools. We have both schools visiting the University of Sussex campus in Brighton, and we also go out to schools.

Around half of our events involve communicating the research carried out at the University direct to schools, colleges and the public.
25% of our events involve describing our particle physics research, usually consisting of a research talk (about the Large Hadron Collider, SNO+, etc) which is reinforced by practical activities (such as building cloud chambers, or visiting our research labs).


Every week during the school terms, we run a School's Lab day, where a group of students visit the University for as full day of experiments specifically designed for the GCSE, AS and A2 level syllabus. During those days, the students visit a research lab, and get the opportunity to talk with our research students about their work. In addition, visiting A-level students also have a research lecture, and get to here the latest research being done here at Sussex.

Every year, we offer masterclasses in both astronomy and particle physics, with one day aimed at GCSE students, and another at A-level. These days involve research-level talks, visits to labs, as well as hands on experimental experience.


We have developed links with local schools and colleges. Teachers frequently approach us to request research related outreach activities (talks, lab tours, practical activities), ask for advice or to borrow equipment for teaching. In 2013, we ran the Institute of Physics sponsored Physic Update weekend conference for teachers.
Since we began our outreach program, undergraduate numbers has risen significantly within the department, from an intake of 40 students in 2009, up to the current (and sustained) 140 students per year.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Keynote/Invited Speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/outreach</gtr:url><gtr:year>2009,2010,2011,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Department of Physics &amp;amp; Astronomy at the University of Sussex runs an intense outreach programme, closely linked to the research carried out within the Department.

We work with members of the general public, and school and college students. We work with over 12,000 people per year, two-thirds of who are children of school age. We interact through stands at various science fairs and in classroom-type setting (including our travelling planetarium).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BE581E35-9F3A-4F19-89AC-72BC6A7518AD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Increased understanding of the triggering conditions at ATLAS for the LHC upgrade.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results will inform the triggering strategy at ATLAS for the LHC upgrades.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E7EC9FBA-6B92-4867-8875-5F0404B1C8E1</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/J003050/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C2898760-D7E5-4B25-A236-E7869CD74F88</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - experiment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>200B9B9B-68EC-4D70-B889-6BD5F4538080</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Beyond the Standard Model</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
