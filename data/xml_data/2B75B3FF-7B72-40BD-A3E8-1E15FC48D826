It is one of the most common zoonoses worldwide and it imposes a vast burden on livelihoods as a result of human disease and impaired livestock productivity as infected animals can experience infertility, abortions and low milk yield. However, brucellosis is rarely prioritized by health systems and as a result the World Health Organization (WHO) includes it as one of its seven neglected endemic zoonoses. Although Great Britain is free from Brucellosis a constant effort is needed to ensure that cattle and sheep remain free from the disease and to be able to detect it as soon as possible in the event of its introduction. More than a million tests per year are conducted for that purpose in GB. In India brucellosis is endemic and recent reports suggest its incidence may be increasing. In this project UK-based and India-based scientists will work together in an area (Punjab) where Brucellosis is endemic among cattle and buffalo. Control of ruminant brucellosis has been achieved with different degrees of success in several settings by applying a range of diagnostic and vaccines. Previous work carried out by the research team suggests that control programs based on targeted, strategic vaccination of some groups of animals may be a cost-effective way of significantly reducing the prevalence in endemic areas wen resources are limited and animal movement between infected and non-infected herds cannot be fully avoided. However, although vaccines are effective at protecting animals from infection and reducing the prevalence of disease in the long term, an important problem of the use of vaccination is the inability to differentiate between truly infected and vaccinated animals with conventional diagnostic tests. In this project our aim is to carry out a detailed study of the epidemiology of brucellosis in bovines and humans in Punjab, including the use of novel diagnostic tests that can differentiate between vaccinated and infected animals. We will use the results to create computer models that we could use to simulate the effect of a control strategy that incorporates the use of these tests. The project will also study the economic impact of the infection, so that we can propose to the veterinary and public health services a control strategy that is realistic and truly benefits local livestock keepers and the population as a whole. The lessons that we will learn with regard to the laboratory testing of infected animals may eventually benefit countries that are free from the disease, such as GB, but have to spend considerable resources in testing animals to ensure that they remain free from infection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Brucellosis imposes a vast burden on livelihoods as a result of human disease and impaired livestock productivity. Studies carried out by Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University have found seroprevalences of human brucellosis higher than 20% in selected populations in Punjab and show the need for integrated control of the disease. Control of ruminant brucellosis has been achieved with different degrees of success by applying a range of diagnostic and prophylactic tools. Researchers from The Royal Veterinary College have shown the potential impact of sustained and strategic use of existing vaccines in endemic settings and how critical it is to adapt the strategy to the level of infection and extent of animal movement. A limiting factor of vaccine-based control programs is the inability of standard diagnostic tools to differentiate between antibodies acquired as a result of natural infection or vaccination. In the proposed research we combine a detailed epidemiological study of bovine brucellosis in Punjab-including validation of novel diagnostic techniques with simulation modelling to generate evidence based on which sustainable control programs for bovine brucellosis could be designed. We will also assess incidence of human infection and economic impact of the disease through animal health economics and transactional cost economics. The results of the field studies will be used to parameterize disease transmission models and to simulate, in silico, the potential impact of different types of vaccination strategies on prevalence reduction. Field studies will also be used to evaluate conventional and novel diagnostics. Specifically, we will study a novel diagnostic strategy using assays measuring response to rLPS antigen. Overall, our work will provide evidence to inform the design and implementation of realistic and sustainable strategies for the reduction of the prevalence of bovine brucellosis and, as a result, human brucellosis, in endemic areas.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide, imposing a vast burden on livelihoods as a result of human disease and impaired livestock productivity. Brucellosis is endemic in India and its incidence may be increasing. Some estimates suggest that in Punjab 10% of the bovines are seropositive and that among selected populations the seroprevalence of human brucellosis is higher than 20%. We propose to address brucellosis control from a holistic perspective, bringing together complementary teams of researchers with expertise in epidemiology, diagnosis and control of the infection in animals and humans as well as economists. By approaching the problem from such a multidisciplinary perspective we expect to be able to propose a program for the control bovine brucellosis in Punjab that is suitable, sustainable and cost-effective. 
The main potential beneficiaries of our research are local livestock keepers and the local population as a whole - as consumers of livestock products. They will directly or indirectly benefit from increased livestock productivity and herd performance as well as safer locally-produced dairy products and reduced infection risk. To ensure that our outcomes benefit all livestock keepers, our project does not only focus on commercially-oriented producers; in addition to commercially-oriented producers we also consider, explicitly, small-scale household production. 
State veterinary services, animal health and public health policy makers in India will be involved in the project and will benefit from its results. The project will provide sound evidence on which multi-sectoral control programs for bovine brucellosis could be based. This will benefit the way in which this and other livestock diseases that pose similar challenges are controlled and will promote science-based policy formulation for the control of livestock diseases.
The preparatory work to the FADH call identified the need to build capacity in veterinary epidemiology in India. The proposed research will link Indian partners with leading institutions in research and teaching in veterinary epidemiology (RVC), medical epidemiology and public health worldwide (LSHTM). In relation to Veterinary Epidemiology, the RVC has recently been designated a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Reference Centre in Veterinary Epidemiology; currently one of only two such centres in the world. GADVASU will also benefit from expertise in state-of-the-art brucellosis diagnosis from another world reference centre (AHVLA - OIE/FAO/WHO Reference &amp;amp; Collaborating Centre for Brucellosis).
The collaboration will benefit UK-based partners by strengthening their position as leading institutions in international programs for the control of diseases affecting the sustainable production of safe food worldwide. In the UK, the project will contribute to the maintenance of the highest levels of brucellosis diagnostic capacity, which is an essential component of current surveillance activities to ensure freedom of disease and allow early detection in the event of introduction. A member of the research team (McGiven) is leading Defra-funded work to improve diagnosis of brucellosis; the insights with respect to the performance of novel tests that can be gained from large field studies in an endemic setting such as Punjab can result in improve diagnostic testing in Great Britain, where each year more than 1 million brucellosis serological tests are performed. 

The collaboration of veterinary and medical institutions with involvement of two leading public health institutions in the UK (LSHTM) and India (PGMIER) will promote trans-disciplinary collaboration much needed for the success of control programs targeting diseases such as brucellosis that require integrated, multi-sectoral control programs. Such trans-disciplinary collaboration will be fully aligned with the current one-health agenda supported by major national and international agencies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>282245</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Dr. Manmeet Kaur, Associated Professor of Health Promotion, PGIMER School of Public Health</gtr:description><gtr:id>E038A117-81C9-463E-A94D-D40F2CB6D348</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results of this component were presented at the international brucellosis research conference and were well received.

The workshop was held in Chandigarh, Punjab, India on the 21st November 2016. The main objectives of the workshop were to ascertain what is being done to control brucellosis in Punjab, identify opportunities to improve control and share project results with stakeholders. Nineteen participants attended the meeting, representing the main institutions involved in zoonosis control in Punjab, including Departments of Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development and Health and the Food and Drug Administration. In addition, public and animal health researchers, clinicians and representatives from the private sector (cooperatives and milk union) were present. The workshop covered three themes (current efforts to control the disease, barriers to the control of the disease and mapping solutions to identified barriers). All of which are used to form future recommendations of the project. Attendees of the meeting were keen to participate in future activity. They further suggested technical expert group should be formed to develop State-level, and maybe even countrywide, guidelines for the diagnosis of brucellosis and management of cases (both human and animal). This group should also facilitate inter-sectoral communication on action to improve and deliver control measures. This was followed up in a later meeting around best practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment in humans.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International brucellosis conference, Delhi, Nov 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>336F6C10-6ADC-4458-A2A5-074F4D28DE14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Preliminary project results were disseminated at this meeting, which brings together Brucella experts from all over the world. The meeting also contained several discussions on the sustainable control of the disease in India. The PI for this project (J.

Such a strong presence in this high profile event was a great platform to give visibility to the project, share some of the findings with the international research community and discuss the practical implications of our preliminary results for the future of brucellosis control in India. After the conference, a number of researchers from India and elsewhere have been in contact with the research team to discuss possible collaborations and request assistance mostly for the design of epidemiological studies and the analysis of epidemiological data. This includes a request to provide support to the design of a potential field trial for the evaluation of a Brucella vaccine in India.

In addition, they have been provided with the protocols for fieldwork so that other research groups which are planning on conducting surveys of brucellosis in other districts can use standardised protocol so results are comparable. 
- We have engaged with Animal Husbandry Departments from the beginning of this project and will be sharing all results and discussing potential future control options future for brucellosis in the Punjab with them once the fieldwork is complete. The results are being compared and discussed with surveillance conducted by Animal Husbandry Departments.Given the importance of Brucellosis for India, the project is likely to have impact beyond the Punjab.
- Stakeholder workshops have been conducted in milk safety and brucellosis control and possible areas to improve this have been identified with policymakers (see engagement activities)
- Diagnostic test performance and use of novel diagnostics as part of brucellosis control programs is one of the main focus of our research and is currently being discussed across India. Initial contact has been established with the Indian Translational Research Platform for Veterinary Biologicals, which will be carrying out an assessment and standardization of brucellosis diagnostic testing across India in the coming months. 
- Significant capacity building has been conducted with our Indian partners, with two academics from GADVASU now enrolled on a Distance Learning Masters in Veterinary Epidemiology taught at the Royal Veterinary College and training in serodiagnostics and epidemiology provided.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>022DDFC5-2804-4A48-8CAB-3780BB70786F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Comprehensive field studies of human and bovine brucellosis have been conducted in a random selection of 40 villages. A total of 281 dairy farms have been sampled, resulting in screening of 1384 individual cows and buffalo and 413 farm workers. Further, a total of 162 pooled milk samples have been collected from household herds. Data on herd management, health and production, as well as individual animals sampled, has been obtained by means of questionnaires. Seroprevalence estimates are currently 20.7% in bovines kept in commercial dairy farms, 11.0% in pooled milk tanks from household herds, 6.7% in farm workers and 2.8% in the general population. These results, suggest brucellosis is common in bovines in the study area and people are regularly exposed, in particular those with occupational contact with cattle and buffalo. Preliminary analysis on interim database for farm workers suggests males have 6.3 times the odds of testing seropositive compared to females. In addition those that had assisted with abortion or calving in the last 12 months had 3.5 and 8.5 times the odds of testing seropositive for Brucella spp. compared to those that had not. A higher percentage of persons that do not always boil raw milk or drank raw milk in the past tested seropositive for Brucella spp., however these results were not significant. Similar associations between assisting with calving and being exposed to brucellosis were found in the general population, suggesting exposure to disease via direct contact may be the primary transmission route in this setting. These results were disseminated to animal and public health officials who are fully engaged with the project. The results are now being used to inform the modelling component of the project and draft recommendations for the control of the disease. Fieldwork is continuing and will be completed in the coming months.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The preliminary results and field protocols have been shared with public health officials in the State Department of Public Health level who are extremely interested in the findings and very engaged with the project. The findings may be used by public and animal health authorities in order to assess the relevant importance of brucellosis as a public and animal health issue in the study area. Data from risk factor analysis will allow them to identify those most at risk. Additional information from modelling and socioeconomic components can be used to provide information on control options for the disease.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>842C66EA-044F-49A7-B82D-FC04CE676EAD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Meetings and sharing of preliminary findings with Dr Gagandeep Grover, State epidemiologist, Public Health Department</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F11AC6CB-4D1D-4F39-957F-40FDBCA0E232</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database includes data on farm management and herd health, as well as the marketing of milk collected from farms in rural Ludhiana selected to take part in the cross-sectional study of brucellosis.

The model is a within-herd Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) model with an additional compartment for persistently infected (PI) and vaccinated (V) individuals (Fig 4). The model is based on differential-equations and is age-structured. The best-fit transmission parameter was obtained using data from previous RVC field studies1. The model was used to investigate the effect of the increased age of Indian cattle on the spread of brucellosis upon introduction to an organised Punjabi dairy farm (compared to other settings where cattle are usually culled at around 4.5 years). In addition, the potential impact of vaccination under different scenarios (varying effectiveness, herd size &amp;amp; transmission coefficients) was investigated</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F20A38B-74A7-44F3-80BC-4E9675528C10</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No impacts yet but the database will be used to perform risk factor analysis and modelling of transmission of the disease from livestock to humans.
