Questions of mimetic realism- of the extent to which we are prepared to believe in the motives and actions of characters in a story -have been largely abandoned in recent criticism of Shakespeare and the English Renaissance, except where certain specific issues of staging, spectacle and gender (the boy player as a realistic heroine, for example) are involved. Yet we still go on talking about and engaging with the characters in Shakespeare's plays as if they were real people. 
My book approaches 'mimesis', or the fictional imitation of reality, as largely an effect of plot or em-plotment- the ordering of the action of a story- and it goes on to find that the strategies of plotting learned by Renaissance dramatists from classical poetics (the treatises of Cicero and Quintilian, and from the analysis of classical comedy) are explicitly forensic, or legal. Cicero's and Quintilian's treatises, though they are treated as treatises on rhetoric generally, were originally designed to help advocates produce convincing accounts of probable motive in courtroom cases, while Latin New Comedy- specifically, the comedies of Plautus and Terence taught in school- was saturated with forensic scenarios and with characters' investigations of one another's motives. 
At the same time as English dramatists were transforming their native chronicle and penitential drama by using these classical resources, English officers of justice- coroners, justices of the peace- were adapting exactly the same legal/rhetorical treatises to meet the new statutory needs of pretrial examination; that is, gathering evidence to bring cases to trial. For the English Reformation not only made England Protestant; it abolished the modes of penance and punishment for sins/crimes associated with annual lay confession and severely restricted ecclesiastical jurisdiction with regard to property. As a result, the civil and criminal justice systems had to become more probing of intention, and more evidential- and, as these were participatory systems, requiring ordinary men and women to bring their suspicions to the justice, and to serve as jurors- this new concern with suspicion, probability and evidence suffused the culture at every level.

POTENTIAL APPLICATION AND BENEFITS: 
My research finds that examining the conjunction between the increasingly evidential culture of the criminal and civil justice systems and the increasingly sophisticated em-plotments of action in plays from the late sixteenth century to the Caroline period illuminates features of English Renaissance drama that are crucial to our experience of it, and that cannot otherwise be analysed or articulated according to current critical paradigms.

RESEARCH CONTEXT: 
The last two decades have seen an eschewing of formal questions in favour of questions of the political and cultural 'fiction of the literary, but my because my research focuses on what the procedures of the law and the formal poetics of drama have in common, I am able to rethink the political and cultural impact of the drama. I argue that realism is itself an effect of dramatists' engagement with problems of evidence, and (consequently) that dramatists contribute to the identification of justice with the evaluation of evidence by the people, an identification which subsequently underwrites important developments in both Anglo American common taw and Western political and media culture generally</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-01-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32055</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/57353796-70AC-484E-854A-A326CEA78C15"><gtr:id>57353796-70AC-484E-854A-A326CEA78C15</gtr:id><gtr:title>Imagining Justice: Kantorowicz and Shakespeare</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Representations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/890877828ca0afad5b5be6b359241c85"><gtr:id>890877828ca0afad5b5be6b359241c85</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hutson L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D500923/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F067D65B-ECCC-4470-B65D-3D66E2CB0032</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Legal History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
