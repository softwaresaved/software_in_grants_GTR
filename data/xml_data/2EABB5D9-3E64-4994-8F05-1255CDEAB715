One of the problems is that over this length ocean currents can cause the risers to vibrate like guitar strings. Vibrations can lead to metal fatigue and can also cause adjacent risers in an array to clash into each other. Both fatigue failures and clashing can have potentially disastrous consequences. Knowing how far apart the risers should be in order to avoid clashing is an issue of considerable importance, since their spacing has huge cost implications for any offshore installation in deep water. Vibrations of risers are generated by two or three different mechanisms which produce excitation of different structural modes, and the response consists of a combination of modes, rather like those that make up the pattern of vibrations of a guitar string. The most important mechanisms that cause risers to vibrate are vortex shedding and wake galloping. The first of these is associated with the periodic shedding of vortices of alternating directions of rotation. Wake galloping refers to the motion of one body downstream of another, generated by the non-uniformity of the flow in the wake. The maximum amplitude of vibrations caused by vortex shedding alone is not much more than one diameter, but in a riser this can occur in high modes and the resulting large bending stresses can drastically reduce fatigue life. Wake galloping on the other hand can cause excursions of many diameters at much lower frequencies, and tends to excite the riser's lowest modes of oscillation. Almost all of what is known about these two processes comes from experiments in which one or other has been studied under simpler conditions. An approach that has been followed before is to study the motion of a stiff cylinder mounted on an elastic system which fixes its single natural frequency (representing one of the multiple natural frequencies of a riser). The problem with this is that in practice vortex-induced vibrations and wake galloping resonate with two distinct natural frequencies of a riser. Moreover, these two fluid mechanisms interact. Vortex-induced vibrations have a major effect on drag, and thus on the instability of one riser in the wake of another. The motion of a riser undergoing wake galloping affects its relative incident flow speed, which in turn determines the frequency and amplitude of vortex-induced vibrations.In this project we plan to build an experiment that will for the first time allow us systematically to study the response of a cylinder which is excited by these two processes simultaneously. To do this, the downstream cylinder has to be mounted on a compound elastic system that has two natural frequencies in each direction: in-line with, and transverse to the incident current. The experiment has several adventurous features and so we shall take care to ensure that, in conditions in which the system is restricted to a single natural frequency, we can reproduce earlier measurements. In subsequent tests we shall investigate a range of cases where the cylinder is undergoing vortex-induced vibration at one frequency at the same time as wake galloping at another. The results will help us to understand the interaction between them, and will provide unique benchmarking data for several groups around the world who are developing software to predict the response of risers to these flow-induced forces and assess fatigue damage and the probability of clashing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>204957</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As a source of validation of numerical models in a PhD project at Southampton University, and within the current EPSRC project EP/K03425 at Imperial College.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>10A934AC-F536-4949-B49B-347D8A8DC76A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Riser are pipes that reach down to the seabed from offshore oil and gas platforms.
