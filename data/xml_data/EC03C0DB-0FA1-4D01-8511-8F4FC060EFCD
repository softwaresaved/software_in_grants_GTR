Our elders are living longer lives and accordingly coping with more long-term illnesses. Inevitably this places an increased and unsustainable burden on our health and social services. In addition, family members are often required to act as unprofessional carers, resulting in more stress and carer illness. Hybrid human-technology solutions can alleviate this problem, supporting independence, prevention, early intervention and management of personal health as well as participation in the community and the workforce. If we can improve individual engagement with technology and use this to access traditional services more efficiently, then we can improve the lifestyle of older adults and the management of long-term health conditions. For those suffering chronic health conditions, improved access to information and services can promote independence for patients and carers; allowing them to interact in an efficient and timely manner with health and care professionals when required.Our project aims to develop an intuitive independent living solution that harnesses existing technologies and is capable of working in the home, the community or in remote locations away from home. The solution must provide both information and advocacy and must support the safety of the user whilst protecting privacy and personal choice. Further, the solution must be modular to allow additional functionality such as safety monitoring, telecare and telehealth, social networking and transaction processing to be added.We believe our approach is truly innovative as we are looking to develop services and solutions that will be effective for the 'worried well' and 'unprofessional' carers as well as front-line agencies such as social services. We will seek solutions that are tailored to the needs and expertise of the customer and that are benefit versus technology lead. We will, therefore, work with Broadband Capital to use the ubiquitousness of the TV, but ensure that the solution(s) will also work across PCs and mobile devices, thus increasing consumer reach. To develop modular and scaleable, anytime, anyplace, anywhere solutions applicable for consumers and agencies, we have sought the commercial and technical expertise of leading technology organisations. Finally, ensuring we 'close the loop' we are utilising the expertise of partners such as Scottish Centre for Telehealth and Essentia to focus on what happens when an event trigger is activated and human intervention is required.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>293116</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kirklees Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>looking local and freedom to roam</gtr:description><gtr:id>86C4BD63-1C95-46CD-B063-B8A0DE8D30F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See outputs for entire project</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Software development and marketing</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Looking Local were the major software partners for the Freedom to Roam project - they developed the Freedom to Roam Marketplace</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3022000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)</gtr:department><gtr:description>FP7</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>288917</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>BFF0E9D4-1B2B-4759-86A4-1B06950AB170</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>246646</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>New Dynamics of Ageing</gtr:description><gtr:end>2009-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Research Councils UK (RCUK)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>RES-352-25-0023</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>70AF33FA-8909-412E-8ECF-09C9FAD3DFF5</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4295755</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Horizon 2020</gtr:department><gtr:description>ACANTO: A CyberphysicAl social NeTwOrk using robot friends</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission (EC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Project reference: 643644</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>1F35711F-8919-4153-8754-4AA5A91DC3D0</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project led to the development of the Freedom to Roam Marketplace by partners Looking Local. This brought together the best apps for older adults together on one platform and provided an Android app that allows healthcare professionals, friends and family to manage patient care via the control panel facet of the marketplace. There is also an inbuilt messaging system that allows communication between healthcare professionals and carers. Details: https://lookinglocal.gov.uk/ftr/
With the GPS capability built-in to tablet devices, FTR allows members of the circle of care to keep a track of patients or relatives as they are out of the house if required, enabling people to have greater independence.

FTR focuses on people who might not have a high degree of technical knowledge, it has been designed so that users do not have to concern themselves with the underlying technology or how tablets work, concentrating instead on interacting with the apps that are chosen to suit their needs. The touch-based system, the simple interface and the remote management of the device have shown in trials that FTR is both accessible and valuable to healthcare professionals, friends and family.
A second partner TrackaPhone used the research to improve their location tracking protocols to ensure more precision in the location tracking of individuals than provided by traditional approaches on mobile phones and tablets, including a method for indoor tracking, for instance, in shopping centres. They extended their services to include location tracking by carers and compete with the traditional telecare solutions that are expensive to install and focus on the home, thus not offering older adults freedom to roam. 
In addition to academic dissemination, findings were promoted in industry publications such as Lifescience (Issue 2) , Dementia and Elderly Care News and also featured in the DoH 2012-13 report: Research and Development Work Relating to Assistive Technology. 
This award in turn led to the funding of the FP7 DALI Project (DALI - Devices for Assisted Living), which led to the development of a smart robotic walking tool for older adults which is currently being showcased on the H2020 portal and has led to the successful award of a second H2020 bid - ACANTO (A CyberphysicAl social NeTwOrk using robot friends) to take this work forward.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>60C59A7A-2E04-4DE5-B785-78CAA7201987</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this project was to provide user-centred research support to an industry-led TSB project with the aim of designing an information service for older adults that would improve quality of life through empowerment and improved choice via a variety of apps, including those employing location based services. The resulting Freedom to Roam (FtR), is a purpose designed application for use on Android platforms specifically for older adults. FtR is designed to incorporate 3rd party remote access via an internet enabled technological device such as PC or laptop to enable technical and service support. The aim of the application is to provide both a channel of communication such as one touch screen contact request or messaging, and a source of technological and service support to the end user from a family member or, a professional carer with multiple charges. The concept behind this service is to maintain and encourage mobility in older adults which will encourage social integration and wellbeing. User-centred, participatory design processes were employed throughout the development of the service and these included technology tea-parties with older adults and the use of card-sort methodologies to prioritise services provided. Two three-week field trials, involving 45 older adults, were used to evaluate the service offer.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The commercial aspects of the work are being taken forward by the i-focus project http://ifocus-dallas.com/pub/
