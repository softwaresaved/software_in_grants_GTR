In the long-term this initiative aims to establish the JGT as a scientific and cultural icon in Scotland and as a focal point for the science outreach in St. Andrews. In the following we will show how we will achieve this goal. Under 'objectives' we list our key goals.

We will set up weekly open nights at the JGT, i.e. evenings where the public can visit the telescope and experience it in action. If the weather allows it, these evenings will be used for scientific observations, for example for hunting extrasolar planets. The visitors will be introduced to the history and the research of the observatory by the on-site astronomer. The on-site astronomers can be staff members, postdoctoral researchers, or advanced postgraduate students. They will be trained by the Observatory Director for these events. Once set up and properly promoted, the events are sustainable as a long-term initiative. Through these open nights, the research carried out in the School of Physics and Astronomy and other astronomy groups in Scotland will be communciated to a large and diverse audience.

To kickstart this initiative, we ask for funding from STFC. In particular, we need resources to advertise the initiative. Using facilities at the University of St. Andrews, we will design and print leaflets and posters for the observatory. Leaflets will be distributed through the tourist office in St. Andrews to visitors and through the University to students. We already maintain contacts to many primary and secondary schools through previous initiatives; our aim is now to provide about 1000 schools in Scotland with a poster of the observatory and to invite school classes to visit the site of the observatory. 

Furthermore, we plan to present the observatory to the amateur astronomers in Scotland, a group that can effectively spread the word about our initiative and thus multiply our efforts. For this to happen, we will visit the main amateur organisations in Scotland, give talks, inform about the observatory, and encourage them to stay in contact. 

On the ground floor of the observatory we will set up a permanent exhibition illustrating the equipment, historic context, the observations, and the ongoing research. This exhibition is already partially in place, additional funding is necessary for poster walls and printing. We will add a desktop computer with display that continuously shows the incoming images from the telescope and results from the analysis, to 'broadcast' the scientific work to the visitors.

We will establish a new website for the observatory, where all information about the telescope and the open nights are presented. Instead of the current static website, the key goal is to include a weblog which can regularly be updated with information on current research projects and events. The framework for such a dynamic website will be created in a summer project by students at the University of St. Andrews, for which funding needs to be reserved.

Finally, the new initiative will be advertised once a year with a press release through the press office at the University of St. Andrews, to reach the important audience of journalists and bloggers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our planned public outreach initiative includes as a major component the promotion of astronomical research to the public, to schools, and amateur astronomers. Several of our planned activities (see 'Objectives') directly contribute to this goal. Thus, dissemination and awareness raising are a natural part of our plans. Towards that goal, we will cooperate with the following organisations: a) the University of St. Andrews, particularly the press office, b) the tourist office in St. Andrews, c) the Edina trust to connect with primary schools, d) the major amateur astronomy societies in Scotland. e) the four public observatories in Scotland (Ardrie, Edinburgh, Paisley, Dundee). Of particular relevance for us is the contact to the Mills Observatory in Dundee, only 15 miles away from St. Andrews, and historically linked with the James Gregory Telescope. Our proposal is complementary to the programs offered by the public observatories; while they carry out sky observations with small telescopes, we will focus on the link with ongoing research programs at the universities in Scotland, which are partly funded through STFC. We cooperate with the astronomy groups at other Scottish universities, via the the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6350</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/L001411/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
