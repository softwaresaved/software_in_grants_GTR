Crime rates have declined, casualised violence has fallen and overt discrimination has become unacceptable. But levels of anxiety regarding declining levels of common decency and standards of behavior continue to rise. Part of the problem lies in the fact that discussions about civility tend to be shaped by anecdote and perception, much of it fuelled by the populist media. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our aim with this project is to move beyond these assumptions by grounding the discussion in a firmer evidence base. In the first phase we will apply the theoretical framework developed by the Young Foundation in its report 'Civility Lost and Found' to three case studies. Firstly, we will be studying an urban area to analyse whether flux, churn and diversity are correlated with declining levels of civility. Secondly, we will look at a rural area of stability with the aim of testing assumptions regarding the desirability of greater stability and homogeneity. Finally, we will apply our analysis to a new community to determine whether civility can be fostered. This phase of the project will be based on ethnographic observation and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with local residents. In the second phase we will draw on a local advisory group to interpret the evidence and generate a set of recommendations regarding possible policy interventions which can help foster a more mindful and civil society.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>88166</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Charm Offensive</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8EDDA563-8F20-4BBF-AF28-0EF9AE4C2F90</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This report finds that far from a thing of the past, civility is something that people still care deeply about wherever they live, but it warns that long-term trends are making civility hard to maintain. It brings together what is known about civility from a range of disciplines and the findings of new empirical research undertaken in very different areas. 



It argues that civility is the largely invisible 'glue' that holds communities together and that experiences of incivility cause hurt, stress and deeper social problems, and has a bigger impact of people's sense of social health than crime statistics. Perhaps most significantly it shows that civility operates on a reciprocal basis and that it is 'contagious'. Yet people, while quick to see incivility in others, seem far less aware of how their own behaviour can offend. 



While the report suggests changes in emphasis in national and local policy, including a better balance between punitive measures and those which actively encourage civility, it concludes that we are all best placed to spread civility through being aware of how we conduct our daily lives.

The research has been widely covered. In addition to comment pieces by leading opinion formers in the Observer, the Financial Times, the Guardian and the BBC, it received news coverage in the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail and was debated on the Today Pro</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-193-25-0001</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-193-25-0001</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
