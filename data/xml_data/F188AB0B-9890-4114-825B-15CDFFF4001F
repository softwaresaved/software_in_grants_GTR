Some of the cargo is taken up into the cells by vesicles formed at the cell surface that deliver their cargo to organelles called endosomes, endolysosomes and lysosomes. Lysosomes act as storage organelles for enzymes that degrade cargo that is delivered from the cell surface or other parts of the cell. Degradation occurs in endolysosomes formed by the fusion of endosomes with lysosomes. We aim to understand the endolysosome better as the compartment in which degradation takes place. We also aim to understand the proteins that make up the machinery necessary to regulate, coordinate and achieve membrane fusion between endosomes and lysosomes. There are many diseases in which defects in the cell surface and/or in membrane traffic to lysosomes occur. These include rare genetic diseases such as the lysosomal storage disorders and more common diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases as well as infectious diseases where microbes subvert the membrane traffic system in order to infect cells. In the long term our work will contribute to developing better ways of targeting drugs to particular sites within cells for more specific drug therapies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In this project we will study the functions of endolysosomes in mammalian cells, use an integrated structural and cell biology approach to study the role of tethers and SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins in fusion events in the late endocytic pathway and test the hypothesis that the VAMP7-binding protein VARP (VPS9 domain and ankyrin repeat-containing protein), through its interactions with many binding partners, plays a key role in regulating and coordinating traffic and fusion events in the late endocytic pathway. We will use confocal fluorescence microscopy, live cell microscopy, super-resolution microscopy, immunoEM and CLEM (correlative light and electron microscopy) of cultured cells to test our hypotheses that: the site of active cathepsin acid hydrolase activity is the endolysosome and not the classical dense core lysosome; endolysosomes but not lysosomes have an acidic aqueous lumen; endolysosomes act as 'hot spots' for kissing and fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes; dense core lysosomes can be reformed from endolysosomes; that endolysosomes play a role in sensing nutrient availability and activating a lysosome-to-nucleus signaling pathway. We shall examine the role of specific SNAREs, SNARE combinations and tether proteins in fusions between late endocytic organelles using siRNA knock down and CRISPR/Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRIPSR) associated (Cas) nuclease 9) knock out in cultured cells. We shall map the interactions of VARP with binding partners and study the role of VARP and its binding partners in traffic out of late endocytic organelles and in fusion between late endocytic organelles, testing our hypothesis that VARP plays a key role in regulating and coordinating traffic and fusion events in the late endocytic pathway.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
In addition to the specific academic beneficiaries that have been listed in the academic beneficiaries section above, the pharmaceutical industry, the general public and the wider academic and clinical community will benefit from our greater understanding of the basic cell biology of membrane traffic in the late endocytic pathway including our understanding of the functions of late endosomes, endolysosomes and lysosomes. Benefits will occur as follows :
1. Benefits for Industry: The basic research outlined in this proposal is likely to be important to the pharmaceutical industry in two specific ways :
(i) There is currently renewed interest by the pharmaceutical industry, in late endocytic organelles, because of the accumulation of weakly basic amphiphilic drugs in such organelles with consequences for drug pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions and off-target toxicity events. One example of the interest is that scientists at GSK working in biotransformation, drug disposition and drug safety have instigated several of meetings with Paul Luzio over the past couple of years to discuss the properties and functions of endolysosomes/lysosomes. These meetings will continue. As new findings emerge about the properties of endolysosomes/lysosomes they will be shared with scientists at GSK and more widely as other interest develops. 
(ii) Identifying and characterizing the molecular machinery of the late endocytic pathway has the longer term prospect of identifying targets for therapy both in lysosomal storage diseases where a complex cell pathology develops as a result of the 'jams' occurring in membrane traffic as a consequence of undigested material build-ups in endolysosomes/lysosomes and infectious diseases where microbes hijack the late endocytic pathway. Such targets are likely to be of interest to those sections of biotec and pharmaceutical industry interested in novel approaches to treating infectious diseases. To explore potential technology transfer we will seek advice and use expertise from Cambridge Enterprise, Cambridge University's technology transfer office.
2. Benefits for the General Public: The general public will benefit from this research, because it will help our understanding of the causes of diseases resulting in abnormal function of the organelles and traffic machinery of the late endocytic pathway. Explaining why these organelles are important for health, what can go wrong and how repair may eventually be achieved will have an educational impact. We will use presentation at the Cambridge Science Festival as well as our Institute website and the CELLpics website for schools as a way to get our new findings across to the general public including patients with defects in the late endocytic pathway. 
3. Benefits for the wider academic and clinical community:In the long term health care professionals, both academic and clinical as well as patients will benefit from the work undertaken in this study especially if new knowledge about the organelles in the late endocytic pathway can lead to better drugs that do not accumulate in the acidic environment of these organelles and if new targets for therapy are discovered. In the long term there may be impact on the well-being and quality of life of patients as well as economic benefits by saving health care costs also initiating activities in the UK-based pharmaceutical industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>667283</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0CF406DD-894B-4523-99D0-3D8ABAD56D19"><gtr:id>0CF406DD-894B-4523-99D0-3D8ABAD56D19</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Genetic Screen Identifies a Critical Role for the WDR81-WDR91 Complex in the Trafficking and Degradation of Tetherin.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4cc9f1f8721ec8e80aca740ec9f931fc"><gtr:id>4cc9f1f8721ec8e80aca740ec9f931fc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rapiteanu R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1398-9219</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D0392BA7-5A61-46FC-BF4A-6EAE86E74804"><gtr:id>D0392BA7-5A61-46FC-BF4A-6EAE86E74804</gtr:id><gtr:title>CALM regulates clathrin-coated vesicle size and maturation by directly sensing and driving membrane curvature.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Developmental cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/694c1b5605570f474a05b581a9553087"><gtr:id>694c1b5605570f474a05b581a9553087</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Miller SE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1534-5807</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/001872A2-790D-4768-B199-79FE42B0FC05"><gtr:id>001872A2-790D-4768-B199-79FE42B0FC05</gtr:id><gtr:title>Endolysosomes Are the Principal Intracellular Sites of Acid Hydrolase Activity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current biology : CB</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/59fc3a52dff9edd33af38f46d27a22b3"><gtr:id>59fc3a52dff9edd33af38f46d27a22b3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bright NA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0960-9822</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M010007/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
