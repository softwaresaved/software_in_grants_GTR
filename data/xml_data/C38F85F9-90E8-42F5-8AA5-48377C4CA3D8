The research team will offer an array of open day and outreach activities geared towards capturing the role of community heritage in the present lives of young people at risk of social exclusion. Two Open Day events and a Roadshow event will be organised and delivered by a team of ten researchers who have expertise in a wide range of disciplines. The events will take place in May and June 2012 and will include exhibitions, performances, videos, readings, workshops and discussions, with emphasis on the participation of young people. Examples of previous work with young people will be showcased, including the following: oral histories, photographic projects, digital documentary production, research training for young people, use of different archives, sport, drama performances, poetry writing and co-evaluations of projects and services. Workshops will be offered in drama, poetry, media production, photography, several aspects of sport, 'Becoming a researcher', 'Piecing the Past Together', 'Amazing Archives' and blogging. Emphasis will be placed on connections to community activities and the ways in which the skills presented in the workshops will enable groups of young people to focus on their heritage. These events will be publicised widely using a range of means. In addition to newsletters, blogs, discussion forum, websites and other electronic forms of communication will be used as active communication tools. The team will follow-up contacts which are made by meeting with community groups, their co-ordinators and external bodies to discuss the potential for application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and to consolidate links once decisions are made about HLF funding applications. In-line with the commitment, skills and experience base of the team, involvement will be based on the principles of participatory research, centred on an empowering, enjoyable and flexible approach to collaborative co-production and co-delivery of activities with young people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The substantive objective of this proposal for development funding is to develop and enhance young people's engagement in community heritage activities. The principles of participation are central to the proposed project. By means of highlighting this important area, the project aims to enhance awareness of young people's participation in community development and to promote and support direct action. These elements will contribute towards the present and future wellbeing of young people. It is anticipated that advances in this arena will generate greater engagement in community life, heightened awareness of the role of heritage in young people's development, and economic and social benefits in the longer term. The arenas and strategies which will guarantee the achievement of the proposed work and its measurement are detailed below.

Communications and engagement
Strategy 1: Organise and deliver two Open Day events and one Roadshow event for young people The research team consists of ten members who possess a wide range of skills and experience. The research team will offer an array of open day and outreach activities geared towards capturing the role of community heritage in the present lives of young people at risk of social exclusion. The events will take place in May and June 2012 and will include exhibitions, performances, videos, sport, readings, workshops and discussions, with emphasis on the participation of young people. Emphasis will be placed on connections to community activities and the ways in which the skills presented in the workshops will enable groups of young people to focus on their heritage. These events will be publicised widely using a range of means. In addition to newsletters, blogs, discussion forum, websites and other electronic forms of communication will be used as active communication tools. The project is timely insofar as it follows on from work recently funded by AHRC, Communities in Care, where contacts were established with groups of children in need in order to develop an understanding of what community means to them. Following on from this work, the proposed project will develop established links with voluntary groups and groups for children and young people in need. 

Strategy 2: Further involvement of beneficiaries 
Contacts made in the showcase events will be followed-up by meeting with community groups, their co-ordinators and external bodies to discuss the potential for application to the Heritage Lottery Fund and to consolidate links once decisions are made about HLF funding applications. In-line with the commitment, skills and experience base of the team, involvement will be based on the principles of participatory research, centred on an empowering and flexible approach to collaborative co-production and co-delivery of activities with young people. 

Strategy 3: Broadening the base for communicating impact The proposers will be responsible for the collaborative production of a final project report. Materials produced will be disseminated widely by means of newsletters, blogs, discussion forum, websites and other electronic forms of communication will be used as active communication tools. An end of project dissemination event is planned where outputs will be disseminated along with discussion of the process of community engagement with young people. The target audience for this will include representatives from young people, representatives from community groups and the third sector and interested academics. A minimum of one journal article will be produced which capture the essence of this work. 

Evaluation and review
An evaluation of the programme of activities will take place to establish further impact. This will include feedback forms at events; these will be collated and will form part of the project final reporting.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19543</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Community Filmmaking and Cultural Diversity conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A2F1D163-B4EE-4861-B4D6-583B9713D0F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of a short film and paper: 'The Ins and Outs of Imaging: Community Filmmaking Beyond Representation' by Rob Coley, Janice Kearns and Adam O'Meara.

Alongside learning about untold local histories, community cohesion and the ways in which different communities relate to each other over time, the project enabled the research team to 'learn in action' about the potential for applying their research expertise to a broad base of interests. Additionally, cross-fertilisation between disciplines enabled colleagues to experience the benefits of a reflexive culture where multiple discourses could be accommodated. Refreshingly, for partners and for academics, the project offered the potential for a new space for public discourse.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In establishing and developing research-community partnerships</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8F713B78-6A43-4374-9C5F-7DAB96B6D365</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EBE249D0-BC14-44DA-BFF9-321B34D9981D"><gtr:id>EBE249D0-BC14-44DA-BFF9-321B34D9981D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Telling our Stories</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0a70a8c2e8f378903f3b9074c3bab7fb"><gtr:id>0a70a8c2e8f378903f3b9074c3bab7fb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hicks, L.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J013692/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C451D81-4626-46D5-BE5B-7B684CED97EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies &amp; Pop Culture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA5B898B-8204-4E59-97AB-DA2B10124EED</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; Theatre - Other</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
