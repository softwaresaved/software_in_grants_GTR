The article informed readers about the lack of high quality scientific evidence for most superfoods and the fact that this term was usually used as a marketing term rather than indicate any specific and proven health benefit.

The partnering award has directly led to new collaborations including exchange of people between researchers in Brail and the UK.
1. 3-month secondment of Dr Renata Borguini from EMBRAPA Food Technology to IFR to undertake a detailed LC-MS analysis of anthocyanins in 3 novel food colour ingredients derived from bioactive-rich Brazilian fruits including training in LC-MS and in mammalian cell culture. This has led to enhanced research capacity in the EMBRAPA unit and has provided the IFR team with material for further research.
2. A planned 6-month collaborative research visit funded by the Brazilian CAPES programme starting April 2017 which will contribute to a new collaboration between Dr Kroon at IFR and Dr Tatiana El Bacha at the Federal University of Rio. The collaboration will focus on polyphenols as modulators of metabolism within breast tissue, which builds on the underlying ISP theme of bioactives acting as modifiers of human metabolism.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AFFCB97C-C971-4EA7-916F-4DFEFFEC7885</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There is considerable interest in plant bioactives and some other food bioactives in both the UK and in many areas of Brazil. Brazil is a source of numerous bioactive-rich plants that are either unique to Brazil / S America or where Brazil is the major producer. It is expected that many of these plants will eventually be introduced to British and European markets.

In this project, a number of research teams and commercial operations in Brazil with interests in bioactive-rich foods have been identified, including numerous EMBRAPA units, several research groups in the University of Sao Paulo and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Several collaborations have been started including one on new sources of anthocyanins with EMBRAPA Crop Science in Rio, one on interactions between polyphenols and other small molecules with VEGF signalling which may have therapeutic use (with Dr Ricardo Giordano at the University of Sao Paulo), one on new blood orange varieties developed to develop the red colour in Brazil, and another on the anthocyanin-rich fruit of the jucara palm, which is related to acai.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The collaboration on new sources of anthocyanins could benefit the food industry by providing alternative sources of natural food colours, and by providing evidence of the health benefits of consuming anthocyanins which would underpin the development of new functional foods.

The small molecule inhibitors of VEGF research aims to identify and characterise food bioactives such as polyphenols and peptides that can inhibit VEGF signalling, which could lead to the development of alternative anti-VEGF therapies.

The development and scaling up of production of blood oranges that can be grown and develop the deep red colour in Brazil will facilitate commercialisation in Brazil and will allow for significant expansion of the global market for this commodity, and its year-round availability.

The new collaboration on jucara has the potential to develop scientific evidence to underpin a future novel foods application for Europe if the European market is interested in this type of product.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>860045A9-B95C-48AE-A59C-2A266CBE4B6C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L027089/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
