The possibility of using genes as medicines to treat cancer is currently limited by the lack of safe and efficacious delivery systems able to deliver therapeutic genes selectively to tumours by intravenous administration, without secondary effects to healthy tissues.
On the basis that iron is essential for tumour cell growth and can be effectively carried to tumours by using specific iron-carrier receptors present in abundance on the surface of cancer cells, we demonstrated that the use of iron-carriers linked to a highly promising gene delivery system resulted in gene expression mainly in the tumours after intravenous administration. This led to a rapid and sustained tumour regression over one month, with disappearance of 90% of the tested tumours and regression of the remaining ones in a laboratory model. 
Building on the promising results already obtained, the proposed project aims to develop new &amp;quot;seek-and-destroy&amp;quot; systems by modifying the iron-carrier, and to evaluate their anti-cancer efficacy on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo after intravenous administration. 
This innovative research would potentially have a major impact on healthcare, as there is currently no gene medicine commercially available for the intravenous treatment of cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The possibility of using genes as medicines to treat cancers is currently limited by the inability to efficiently deliver therapeutic genes to remote tumours by intravenous administration, without secondary effects to healthy tissues. 
With the long-term aim of developing an efficacious cancer-targeted gene medicine, we demonstrated that polypropylenimine dendrimers conjugated to transferrin, whose receptors are overexpressed on most cancers, were highly promising, tumour-selective gene delivery systems : their intravenous administration to tumour-bearing mice led to a rapid and sustained tumour regression over one month, with disappearance of 90% of the tested tumours and regression of the remaining ones for the cancer model tested. This treatment was well tolerated by the animals.
Building on the promising results already obtained, the proposed project aims to develop new &amp;quot;seek-and-destroy&amp;quot; systems, by modifying the tumour targeting functionalities of the dendrimers as follows:
1) Replacement of the transferrin moiety by other promising tumour-targeting ligands of the same family that have intrinsic antitumoral activity, such as lactoferrin, lactoferricin and Beta-35.
2) Preparation of bifunctional dendrimers: conjugation of transferrin and lysine, conjugation of transferrin and transforming growth factor alpha.

The tumour targeting and therapeutic efficacy of these dendrimers will be evaluated on various cancer models, in vitro and in vivo after intravenous administration.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>- Cancer patients
Cancer kills more people in the UK than any other disease: one cancer sufferer dies every 15 minutes, which adds up to over 35 000 people a year. 
The proposed research will address the unmet need of tumour-targeted delivery of plasmid DNA by intravenous administration, which is currently the subject of much research worldwide. Numerous highly promising therapeutic genes cannot be used clinically because of their failure to specifically reach remote tumours by intravenous administration. This represents a frustrating impasse, resulting in many potentially life-saving therapeutics being unavailable until this delivery issue is solved. The impact of our proposed project is therefore likely to be significant.

- Pharmaceutical industry
The pharmaceutical industry will be another beneficiary from this research, as this project aims to tackle a scientific challenge with direct relevance to patient treatment. The development of a safe and efficacious non-viral gene medicine able to specifically target and treat tumours after intravenous administration would have a major impact on healthcare. World gene therapy market is rapidly expanding and is forecast to reach $ 484 million by 2015. However, it is still in the experimental stage with success yet to be achieved in developing completely curative therapeutic drugs. To date, only two anti-cancer gene medicines, Gendicine and H101 are commercially available. These two p53 tumour-suppressor gene medicines are delivered in a viral vector for the intratumoral treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. There is currently no gene medicine commercially available for the intravenous treatment of cancer, thus making the development of an intravenously administered tumour-targeted gene medicine particularly promising. The proposed project is expected to improve the efficacy of intravenously administered gene therapy to tumours, leading to better anti-cancer therapy. 

- Academia
As detailed in &amp;quot;Academic beneficiaries&amp;quot;, the proposed project will be of interest to many multidisciplinary researchers. The information we obtain from this project will be shared with the scientific community by means of publication in scientific journals and presentation at conferences.

- National Health Service (NHS)
The Department of Health gives the total cost of treating cancers as &amp;pound;5.13 billion in 2008-2009, which accounts for 5.3% of total NHS spending during this year. In the very long term, targeted gene therapy with the ability to effectively treat cancer would have a pronounced impact on the significant financial burden caused by cancer patients on the NHS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151712</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Strathclyde</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy &amp; Biomedical Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>NMR analysis of the delivery systems</gtr:description><gtr:id>8A103658-0483-4306-8B97-D812A76990A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is extremely important for us, as it is crucial to confirm the identity of the synthesized compounds before further analyzing them in vitro and in vivo.

These 2 novel dendrimers have demonstrated their ability to carry DNA by formation of complexes, which occurred almost instantaneously and was stable over at least 24h. In vitro transfection experiment revealed that the conjugation of Lf to DAB led to a significantly improved transfection compared to DAB-Tf on A431 carcinoma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors. A qualitative analysis of the targeting efficacy of these delivery systems by confocal microscopy revealed that the co-localization of fluorescently-labelled DNA in the nucleus was more pronounced after treatment with DAB-Lf dendriplex compared to unconjugated dendriplex.
The conjugation of lactoferrin and lactoferricin to the dendrimer significantly increased the gene expression in the tumor while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the liver. Consequently, the intravenous administration of the targeted dendriplexes encoding TNFa led to the complete suppression of 60% of A431 tumors and up to 50% of B16-F10 tumors over one month. The treatment was well tolerated by the animals.

Numerous highly promising therapeutic genes cannot be used clinically because of their failure to specifically reach remote tumours by intravenous administration. This represents a frustrating impasse, resulting in many potentially life-saving therapeutics being unavailable until this delivery issue is solved. The impact of our proposed project is therefore likely to be significant.
This research is at the interface of cancer therapy and gene delivery. As a result, it will be of interest to the thousands of academics investigating these topics worldwide. This will include the scientists involved in cancer biology, gene delivery, biomaterials, pharmaceutics, as well as clinical oncologists.</gtr:impact><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Synthesis of tumour-targeted gene delivery systems</gtr:title><gtr:type>Therapeutic Intervention - Cellular and gene therapies</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2012</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The research database &amp;quot;Novel tumour-targeted gene delivery systems for intravenous cancer therapy&amp;quot; is available in &amp;quot;Knowledgebase&amp;quot;, the public research portal of the University of Strathclyde.

Lactoferrin and lactoferricin are iron-binding members of the transferrin family, able to bind the transferrin receptors. In addition to their tumour delivery properties, these iron-carriers have recently been shown to have anti-cancer properties themselves, which make them highly attractive as part of a gene medicine.
These 2 novel dendrimers have demonstrated their ability to carry DNA by formation of complexes, which occurred almost instantaneously and was stable over at least 24h. In vitro transfection experiment revealed that the conjugation of Lf to DAB led to a significantly improved transfection compared to DAB-Tf on A431 carcinoma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors. A qualitative analysis of the targeting efficacy of these delivery systems by confocal microscopy revealed that the co-localization of fluorescently-labelled DNA in the nucleus was more pronounced after treatment with DAB-Lf dendriplex compared to unconjugated dendriplex.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DD9F6A5D-6778-484E-8BFF-C13DA1FA438D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These tumour-targeted gene delivery systems are highly promising.
