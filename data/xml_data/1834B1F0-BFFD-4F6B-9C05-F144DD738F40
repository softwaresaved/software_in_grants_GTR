Dramatic events, such as the detonation of the Chelyabinsk fireball over Russia in early 2013, can briefly catch the collective imagination. However, media coverage often emphasises the potential dangers posed by such incidents and the science involved is only briefly discussed. And yet close encounters between people and space rocks are not particularly rare events. On average each year there are seven witnessed fireball events in which space rocks are subsequently recovered for scientific study (source: Meteoritical Bulletin for period 2001 to 2008). Even the United Kingdom, a comparatively small country in terms of surface area, has 18 authenticated falls from which samples were recovered. Based on our outreach activities at the Open University we know that being able to handle real meteorite samples invokes a dramatic response in people, inspiring curiosity and interest. Just holding our 10 kg sample of the iron meteorite Gibeon, which is nearly three times denser than a terrestrial surface rock, provokes people into asking questions about how and why asteroids and planets melt and then separate into a core, mantle and crust. Being able to touch a piece of Mars or the Moon changes a person's perceptions; space no longer seems quite so remote. Handling real samples from other worlds can, and does, dramatically alter attitudes, transforming people who were previously indifferent to space science into real enthusiasts. In short, meteorites have a unique potential to open up planetary and space sciences to all sections of the public.

The central aim of this project is to inspire and educate the general public about planetary and space science by creating an exhibit that places real meteorites at the centre of an authoritative and interactive audiovisual display. At the heart of this project is our experience that by being able to hold and interact with real space materials inspires people's curiosity. As a result of being able to handle such samples they quickly formulate questions about a host of related topics, such as: How old are meteorites? Where do they come from? Do they pose a real and present danger? Where do you find them? Did they really kill the dinosaurs? How do you know we have meteorites from Mars and the Moon? To respond to such questions and to provide an exciting audiovisual experience, the exhibit will include an interactive display consisting of a touch-screen computer and large plasma screen display. This interactive system will provide a range of information, video materials, animations and face-to-face interviews aimed at highlighting topics relevant to many of the STFC Roadmap Science Challenges. 

The overall philosophy of the exhibit will be to show how samples that land on Earth can be used to investigate a wide range of astronomy and planetary science-related topics, including: Earth-crossing asteroids, structure and evolution of the asteroid belt, comets, the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System, delivery of volatiles to Earth, early Solar System evolution and the formation of stars. The exhibit will be designed at the Open University with a full working version installed at the Manchester Museum. A second version of the interactive display will be retained at the Open University, where it will be used to undertake further development work based on the feedback received from the &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; exhibit at Manchester Museum. As part of the project, an on-line interactive website will be produced, which will provide a means of making this resource available to a wide audience. The website will include a downloadable application for tablet computers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A variety of pathways will be used to promote awareness of the project. 

The Open University has strong links to national broadcast media, particularly through its partnership work with the BBC. We will make full use of these contacts to publicise Catch a Shooting Star. In particular, in our discussions with the national media we will emphasise the central theme of the project that meteorite science plays a key role in understanding the origin and evolution of our Solar System. Through our contacts with the Royal Astronomical Society we will bring the project to the attention of both professional and amateur astronomers. The British and Irish Meteorite Society (BIMS) maintain a popular and well-visited website http://www.bimsociety.org/: which will be used to draw attention to the project. In addition, BIMS maintains good contacts with many local astronomy groups and these will be used to disseminate details about the project. 

At a more local scale, the Manchester Museum will circulate details of the exhibit to a variety of interested groups in their catchment area (schools, clubs, local media etc). We will contact a range of interested organisations including other museums, the British National Space Centre, observatories and planetariums to make them aware of the Manchester exhibit. In our contacts with the national media we will try to encourage members of the general public to visit the Manchester Museum and also to make use of the web-based resources. 

During the course of the project we will undertake presentations to a wide variety of audiences. We will publicize the activity to fellow planetary and space scientists by presenting posters and/or talks at both the annual Meteoritical Society meeting and the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. The results of this project will also be of interest to those engaged in the Museum sector. We will therefore work through the Museums Association to raise awareness of the project. 

In addition to the Final Report we aim to publish at least two peer-reviewed publications documenting different aspects of Catch a Shooting Star. A paper will be submitted to Meteoritics and Planetary Science examining how useful meteorites proved to be as a tool for raising science awareness. A second will examine how learning outcomes differ between museum-based and online environments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9581</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Manchester Museum</gtr:department><gtr:description>Shooting Star</gtr:description><gtr:id>068A5EBC-28B3-4C63-A39F-169AE755AEA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Main output is an exhibit at the Manchester Museum, where visitors can touch pieces of meteorite</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>trained staff in preparation of material and text for public display</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Design and build of an exhibit for the museum</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conversation pieces</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF8000F0-2DEA-4176-97B7-A812FFC31110</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The OU was one of the first universities to support the daily news blog The Conversation (https://theconversation.com/uk). The site has the tag-line &amp;quot;Academic rigour, journalistic flair&amp;quot;: academic specialists write the articles, which are edited for readability. This is the opposite from most news sites, in which journalists write the articles, relying on specialists to provide a quote. Five of the CoIs on the CG have written 61 articles in the past two years, which have been read a total of 1.5 million times; an additional 4 PDRA and 3 PhD students have written a further 13 articles, attracting 380,000 views. Every article is accompanied by the text 'X receives funding from the STFC'. One of the CoIs (Grady) has a column on the site, which is syndicated to the US and Australian editions of the news site, gaining a wider coverage for the articles. At the current rate of growth of the site, it is anticipated that there is likely to be at least one article per week from CG staff, their PDRA and students, gaining a global coverage for their research.
