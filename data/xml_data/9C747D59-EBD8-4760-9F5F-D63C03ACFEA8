Diabetes currently affects over 2,000,000 people in the UK alone and this number is steadily increasing. Since the discovery of insulin in 1921 there has be a steady progress in treatment of the disease but none that have been able to address the shortfall in beta-cells or arrest their decline in number. The complexity and cost of investigating therapeutic targets is a significant hurdle to the development of new treatments or a cure. It is also one of the main motivations for attempting to develop computational models that can be used to predict and explain the processes governing the regulation of the number of functioning beta-cells in the pancreas. The aim of this work is to bring together researchers from control systems engineering and biological science to work in each others' laboratories towards developing such models. In particular, this research will apply appropriate methodologies from control systems engineering to the analysis of the biological problem at a number of different levels from data collection and error analysis to process and network modelling. The combination of researchers and their shared use of facilities will enable a deeper understanding of the requirements and constraints of the problems, the nature of measurable parameters and potential signalling and process structures. This should enable more biologically meaningful models to be constructed that in turn can be used to drive the experimental process in a targeted manner. While the work here considers the problem of beta-cell homeostasis, we fully expect the results of this research to have wider significance in systems biology and elsewhere.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65932</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was a Discipline Hopping Award for control &amp;amp; systems engineers and life scientists. The aim was that two control engineers (Chipperfield, Southampton and Heath, Manchester) and a biological/medical scientist (Khan, Warwick) should investigate how control systems methodologies could be applied in systems biology. In particular, we investigated the relationship between computational models of biological processes and experimental design using systems engineering techniques to critically analyse the processes involved and address shortcomings in current practice. A further aim was for the collaborators to acquire additional skills and expertise to enhance future research activities. The engineers developed wet-lab skills and knowledge of biological experimental design and the biomedical scientist developed a deeper understanding of model-based design methods.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The approaches we considered have already been applied to medical and biomedical research as described in the exploitation routes. The experimental and analysis methodologies are currently being explored in the design and validation of new devices for blood flow and tissue imaging with an SME, Moor Instruments Ltd. and we are working with clinicians within the NHS to use our findings to help devise more patient-specific approaches to diagnosis and treatment of chronic conditions. As a result of the exposure to experimental biomedical science, the experience and techniques acquired have been applied in a number of research projects. This includes the study of physical activity and blood glucose control in type 1 diabetes (supported by Diabetes UK, BDA: RD06/0003306), evaluation of the effects of high dose statin treatment in microvascular dysfunction (supported by Pfizer UK) and the evaluation of a high power, wide separation laser Doppler probe for measurement of blood flow in deeper tissue (with Moor Instruments Ltd.). These methodologies are currently being applied to problems in sensing saturated oxygen levels in the skin, developing sensing techniques for use in care of diabetic foot ulceration patients and evaluating the relationship between habitual patterns in blood sugar variation and risk factors in people with type 1 diabetes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A3D9C4FE-6E59-4E55-93F6-B4662E844BBA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AC716784-6C48-4EA4-B4DE-866AFE186B8C"><gtr:id>AC716784-6C48-4EA4-B4DE-866AFE186B8C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Supporting interactive presentation for distributed multimedia applications</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Multimedia Tools and Applications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4c62234aeb967827bd6e90bab5ef63c1"><gtr:id>4c62234aeb967827bd6e90bab5ef63c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bates J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>1995-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/328CB99F-52F5-4F27-A6C5-3A51FC5620D6"><gtr:id>328CB99F-52F5-4F27-A6C5-3A51FC5620D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gaussian process modelling of blood glucose response to free-living physical activity data in type 1 diabetes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a1a29ce8b2f5f25f05413ffdb2e3c449"><gtr:id>a1a29ce8b2f5f25f05413ffdb2e3c449</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>J Valletta</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/E056741/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>53F27348-198B-4AEF-A34B-8307067F507C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>21CE2EA6-E7A2-4406-A045-0DA7CA19B695</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Control Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A6E5CEB-ACA3-4301-98AD-C7EC310948FD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theoretical biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
