This passing on the information is referred to as cell division and is called mitosis. In humans, a fertilized single-celled egg requires many cell divisions to make a new individual. In an adult, nerve and muscle cells do not divide but liver cells divide once a year. More than one division a day occurs in blood cell precursors in the bone marrow and in the cells lining the gut. Therefore our survival requires a production of millions of cells daily. Mitosis is an extremely important phase in the life of any cell and it must be carried out without errors. If a cell division goes wrong then major consequences may arise either for the cell or for future generations. Mitotic errors during development can produce malformations or miscarriages and, in adults they can lead to cancer. The proposed research is looking at the proteins that regulate the final steps of mitotic divisions. Proteins can have extremely specialised functions. Some are important for building structures while others are involved in chemical reactions occurring within a cell. One family of such proteins with chemical functions is called phosphatases and they are involved in many important cell reactions. Among them is Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). My previous research has shown that PP1 together with a partner protein Repo-Man is very important for controlling cell division and their malfunction leads to dramatic problems in the cell progeny. In particular, they produce derivative cells that manifest mistakes in the organization of the genomic material and the Nuclear Lamina (an important barrier that enclose the genomic material in a cell). These defects are similar to the ones that occur in cancer cells and in cells during the aging process. It is therefore imperative to acquire more in depth knowledge on how PP1 works and why its malfunction affects the outcome of cell division. The proposal is to gain a better understanding of how this PP1 contributes to the regulation of cell division, what are the consequences to the cell should this process go wrong and also to identify new proteins that are important for PP1 activity. Finally, obtaining a highly detailed description of how these molecules work together will provide the background mean to generate chemicals that can act by modulating their action and therefore could be used to control cell division in pathological cases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Reversible phosphorylation of proteins constitutes a major mechanism of regulation in all living organisms. Most studies have concentrated on kinases while our understanding of the regulation of phosphatases is limited. During cell cycle, phosphatases dominate in the transition from mitosis to G1 when mitotic phospho-proteins are reversed to their hypo-phosphorylated interphase status. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a ubiquitously expressed Ser/Thr phosphatase. In higher eukaryotes the 3 different PP1 catalytic subunits and their interacting proteins (PPIP) comprise a large family of biochemically diverse enzymes with exquisite substrate specificity. PP1 is important for mitotic progression but the identification of the specific roles of the different PP1 isoforms during mitotic progression has been challenging due to the facts that chemical inhibitors are not isoform-specific and RNAi studies cannot discriminate between mitotic and non-mitotic functions of PP1. In the present project I propose to generate innovative and unique reagents to study PP1 functions during mitotic exit in vertebrate cells. I will generate rapid-degradable allele of each PP1 isoform by knock-in of a degron module into the endogenous locus. With a similar strategy I will generate a tagged allele of the endogenous PP1 gene for pull-down experiments aimed to isolate mitotic-exit specific PPIP. I have already shown that Repo-Man/PP1 complex is an important anaphase phosphatase and I have preliminary data suggesting that Ki67, a protein evolutionary linked to Repo-man, is another PPIP. Both proteins are chromosome-linked but not co-localising in the same chromosome domains. I plan to map their respective chromatin binding sites by DamID and to identify the chromatin environment that is associated with each of them. Moreover, I will conduct the first chromatin positional screen for known and newly identified PPIP. Finally, I will provide structural data on the Repo-Man/PP1 complex.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research although heavily basic-science oriented will have several beneficiaries. The advance in knowledge on the specific discipline of cell biology will be of great value to the academic community and the new methodologies and approach proposed with in the project will be a valuable assess to the wider discipline of life sciences. 
The overall question of understanding the fundamental mechanisms of controlling cell division and regulating gene expression has also great impact to the general public. Cell division is at the base of the maintenance of genome stability; errors in cell division can affect either the development of an organism resulting in malformations or miscarriages or the in adult life they can lead to cancer. Therefore we need to gain more basic insight into the process by identifying the important molecules that regulate these fundamental processes. This will help the pharmaceutical industry to direct resources toward the right target for the development of suitable chemical treatments. Such advances will be of direct benefit to the general population both in terms of health, well-being, and indirectly on the socio-economic wealth.
This particular study will also have direct impacts for the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology industries. It is well know that mitotic inhibitors are widely used in cancer therapy and several chemicals inhibitors of important mitotic kinases are already in advanced clinical trial. Despite their importance, these drugs are often not so specific and patient can become resistant to them during the treatment. Therefore the identification of molecules with potential as druggable target is extremely important. Protein Phosphatases are among these emerging classes of molecules and their utility as drug target has been already demonstrated for example in the treatment of the hypertension. The discovery of the important phosphatase and their molecular structure will help and feed the Pharmaceutical companies.
Finally, the dissemination of the findings to the general public will produce a more public awareness on the importance of the basic science investigations for the improvement of public health and the generation of wealth within the country and worldwide.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>529859</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Wellcome Trust Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Prof Juri Rappsilber Mass spectrometry</gtr:description><gtr:id>D50C5C11-481B-443A-854B-2591BF7FCC19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article: DOI: 10.1038/ncomms14048
