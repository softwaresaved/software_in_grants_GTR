interpersonal interactions</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K009400/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Prosperity in all aspects of social life, from interpersonal relationships to economic or political relationships, depends on human cooperation and trust. The concept of trust is particularly relevant these days, as some economists have attributed the ebbs and flows of the economy to irrational fluctuations in our confidence in others. Trust will be defined as the subjective expectation that others will not harm or disadvantage us in instances when they have an opportunity to do so. Accordingly, trust decisions will be defined as the decisions that give others such an opportunity. Why do people differ in the ways and degrees in which they trust familiar or unfamiliar others in given interpersonal situations? What dynamic interplay of parameters determines trust decisions in interpersonal interactions? Can such decisions be facilitated or inhibited by some intervention and how? These questions are at the heart of this project. To answer these questions we will design experiments that entail 'on-line' interpersonal exchanges and will model the complexity of human behaviour in these interactions using advanced methods. We will measure the dynamic influence of various individual traits and social signals (e.g. 'trustworthy' behaviour by others) on people's decisions to trust others. In this endeavour, we will use the oxytocin system as a tool. 

The oxytocin system in the brain may be one of the main mechanisms driving individual differences in the expression of interpersonal trust. In animal studies, scientists have discovered that this neural system, which uses the hormone oxytocin to communicate with other brain areas, plays a key role in inter-species differences in social behaviour, as well as in differences between members of the same species. For example, the oxytocin system has been shown to influence the formation of lasting attachments with one's offspring or peers, the display of caring behaviour towards offspring or partners, social play, the recognition of one's partner's or offspring's by their odour, or the display of distress by offspring when abandoned. While there is also accumulating evidence that the function of the oxytocin system also influences social behaviour in humans, almost nothing is known regarding how the oxytocin system is organised in the human brain. We also know next to nothing about the possible existence of gender differences (as is the case with other species), about how this system is linked with differences in human social preferences, including decisions to trust, and about how this system can exert a dynamic influence on the processes underlying judgements of trustworthiness and decisions to trust. 

In this project, we will use state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques and innovative data modelling and analysis methods to try and shed some light on these questions. We hope to generate new findings that will make a significant contribution to understanding the processes driving trust behaviour, as well as to generate new evidence about the oxytocin system in the human brain, which will be of direct interest across a range of disciplines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The successful completion of this project will generate urgently needed findings that will be directly relevant and translatable not only to several research domains, but also to any domains of social life based on interpersonal relationships and trust. 

Some of the potential benefits of this project for non-academic beneficiaries are: 

(1) Intranasal oxytocin has started to emerge as a potential adjunct treatment for disorders with deficits in the processing of social information (e.g. autism), social skills (e.g. borderline personality disorder) or with anxiety and depression symptoms. While the proposed work does not directly assess the efficacy of oxytocin as a treatment for these conditions, we hope it will provide some important new findings that may guide psychiatric applications and benefit patient groups. Specifically:

- The information on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxytocin in the human brain will provide the necessary basic science information for the optimal design of clinical trials using intranasal oxytocin.
- We will try to link, for the first time, differences in the geography of oxytocin receptors with differences in social behaviour. Animal research suggests that this, and not the increase in the volume of released oxytocin in the brain, is the critical factor underpinning social behaviour. This is an important issue to take into consideration when examining the use of intranasal sprays as an adjunct therapy, e.g. in autism.
- We will generate information regarding gender differences in (a) the oxytocin system in the human brain, (b) the effects of intranasal oxytocin on human behaviour and (c) the link between brain and behaviour. These findings could inform decisions regarding the potential use of oxytocin in the case of disorders with marked gender differences. Examples include the treatment of social deficits in autistic spectrum disorders, or in the treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms in mood disorders.

(2) Drug companies and neuropsychopharmacologists developing new compounds to act on the central nervous system may benefit from our research, as it will contribute to the development of a new non-invasive methodological approach to investigate the effects of compounds in the central nervous system, and estimate information about their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 

(3) We expect that the findings we will generate will be of great interest to the general public. Findings from the nascent field of oxytocin research often make the news headlines, indicating that they have a wider societal appeal. This is because oxytocin is believed to be involved in all quintessential aspects of human social life - love, sex, trust, morality to name a few. The effects of oxytocin sprays may be exaggerated by the news media when they talk about the &amp;quot;hormone of love&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;moral molecule&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;trust hormone&amp;quot;, or when concerns are raised about potential abuse, e.g. by political propaganda. But trust is the implicit fabric of our societies, the basis of our interpersonal as well as social and political relations, of which we understand so little in experimental psychology and neuroscience. We expect that the wider audience will be interested in our findings, and we will undertake an ambitious public dissemination program to this effect (see Pathways to impact). 

Therefore, the outcomes of this project are expected to have both health care and societal impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>254072</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Lisbon</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Portugal, Portuguese Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Marie-Curie, Prata</gtr:description><gtr:id>525E0CAC-5911-4DA0-A567-B3030C9FCAC8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Initiation of a research program targeting the interactions between the oxytocin and the dopamine systems and their impact on social cognition.

Animal research, as well as genetic studies from humans further link abnormalities in the oxytocin system with a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. This work highlights the administration of exogenous oxytocin as a promising pharmacological agent to target key brain regions and regulate social behaviour and address social impairment in psychiatric disorders. 

Human studies have almost exclusively relied on the administration of exogenous oxytocin with nasal sprays. It assumed that exogenous oxytocin reaches the brain through direct nose to brain pathways, bypassing the blood-brain barrier (an obstacle in the delivery of large peptides like oxytocin to the brain which do not cross the blood-brain barrier in sufficient amounts). Yet it is argued intranasal oxytocin may not be reaching the brain directly, and its effects may be mediated by increasing the concentration of oxytocin in the blood and acting on peripheral oxytocin receptors. Furthermore, intranasal sprays provide poor control over the administered dose and an inefficient way of targeting the areas of the nasal cavity underlying direct nose to brain transportation. An additional obstacle in human research is that the time course of the effects of intranasal oxytocin in the human brain has not yet been directly established. Finally, we do not yet know how the oxytocin system is organised in the living, typically developing, human brain. 

So far in this project we have completed important groundwork addressing these questions that was essential to address the main objectives of this grant and informs future experimental studies and clinical trials (as demonstrated in the wide range of collaborations linked with this grant). 

Specifically, we: (a) mapped the brain areas responding to oxytocin and we obtained a functional signature of the response to oxytocin using pattern recognition; (b) we generated a roadmap regarding the optimal timing of experimental and clinical interventions using intranasal oxytocin; (c) investigated the question regarding the extent to which changes in brain function following intranasal oxytocin are due to the increase of oxytocin concentration in the blood or due to direct transportation to the brain; (d) Investigated the value of potentially more efficient methods for the intranasal administration of oxytocin. 

We have also clarified the impact of oxytocin on pain perception, showing that it has analgesic properties in humans. Understanding the effects of oxytocin on pain perception was of key importance in this project that uses pain units as a negative currency in neuroeconomic games aimed to understand the effect of oxytocin on decisions to trust others.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our current work covers important groundwork that directly informs future experimental studies and clinical trials as demonstrated in the wide range of collaborations linked with this grant.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B2E19702-4AF0-4F35-BB2E-607F15DBFF9E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322314007653</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We successfully applied multivariate pattern analysis on cerebral blood perfusion data which allowed us to estimate the pharmacodynamic effects of the intranasal delivery of oxytocin in the living human brain.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5BFE4CF0-A86A-43C6-AF30-A70FAEE8F25E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We describe the oxytocinergic network in the living human brain for the first time and provide a roadmap for other studies using oxytocin regarding the optimal timing of experimental and clinical interventions.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Use of multivariate pattern analysis to estimate the pharmacodynamics of a neurochemical agent (oxytocin) in the living human brain.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.10.005</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/950F3DE9-89B3-41E1-8236-6952EFF09372"><gtr:id>950F3DE9-89B3-41E1-8236-6952EFF09372</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Analgesic Effect of Oxytocin in Humans: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Cross-Over Study Using Laser-Evoked Potentials.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neuroendocrinology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/82c11ec60b71d3e2fae9b734d7df78f3"><gtr:id>82c11ec60b71d3e2fae9b734d7df78f3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Paloyelis Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0953-8194</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A32E5965-CF40-4B88-B1AC-309328565D38"><gtr:id>A32E5965-CF40-4B88-B1AC-309328565D38</gtr:id><gtr:title>Partners' empathy increases pain ratings: effects of perceived empathy and attachment style on pain report and display.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/66b2b9a026fed59749cbe604358f5daf"><gtr:id>66b2b9a026fed59749cbe604358f5daf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hurter S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1526-5900</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E9100B37-D21E-44B4-A554-57FCF6A2FC74"><gtr:id>E9100B37-D21E-44B4-A554-57FCF6A2FC74</gtr:id><gtr:title>Affective touch and attachment style modulate pain: a laser-evoked potentials study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.
