This project relates to a number of STFC areas of science and technology: space science; instrumentation; physics of the planets and magnetosphere. It is intended to encourage students from 14 to 18 years old to look at how instruments can be used to collect data and integrate it together to give a wider understanding of physical phenomena. The proposed instrument involves learning that crosses several topical areas, such as electronics, computing and electromagnetism and links into the study of space from the planet's surface. It will also highlight the how remote processes on the Sun can affect the magnetic field of the Earth. The instrument is non-gender-specific so is suitable for all young people and anyone able to use a computer to run the sensor and visualise the data.

This will be a pilot study to recruit schools and teachers around the UK to trial the use of a custom-built three-axis magnetometer with a Raspberry Pi computer. The schools will receive support from Lancaster University and BGS and we will also produce bespoke educational materials to begin with. The schools will feedback about their experiences running the instrument and how they use it in the teaching of curriculum, allowing us to improve the materials. All data measured will be available via a centralised website, allowing the schools to compare their data with others across the country. With the building of a network, open to both schools and citizen scientists, we hope to encourage students and teachers to think about the magnetic field and the physical processes involved.

One of the reasons for doing this now is because, as a society, we are increasingly reliant on space-based technologies such as GPS and satellite communications. We have become more exposed to risks from Space Weather - primarily, the interaction between the Earth and the Sun's magnetic fields. Although the visible effects caused by Coronal Mass Ejections from the Sun are the aurorae observed during large geomagnetic storms, there are also invisible effects on the magnetic field that can recorded on the ground. The second aim of this project is to involve schools and other interested parties in making precise measurements of the magnetic field across the UK so researchers can understand these effects in more detail.

Until recently, equipment with the required level of sensitivity needed to detect the variations of the magnetic field due to space weather (around ten parts in a million) has only been available to the scientific community. The costs have typically been on the order of several thousands of pounds for a set of dedicated instrumentation. However, with advances in technology, instruments of almost-scientific quality can now be built for around two hundred pounds. We have spent the past year testing a number of different magnetic sensors and developing new prototypes. 

On its own a single magnetic sensor (magnetometer) is not particularly useful, but tied into a UK-wide network of sensors, such a system can provide both an educational tool for physics, astronomy, geology and geography students and a means to participate in a scientific experiment to study the detailed variation of the magnetic field over the UK, particularly during a geomagnetic storm. The BGS runs three observatories in the UK, but these are located in an approximately straight line from Shetland to Devon. Additional instruments across the UK will help 'fill in the gaps' and provide longitudinal coverage in the UK, allowing more detailed maps of the magnetic field variation to be made.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have been in contact with a number of schools in the Edinburgh and Peterborough areas, both through contacts in the School Seismometer network and from contacts in the Institute of Physics, Physics Teacher Network in Scotland. We have received four expressions of interest from schools in and around Edinburgh and two from schools near Peterborough. The Schools Seismometer project will allow us to advertise the sensor to the wider teacher community who are interested in collecting many types of physical data (e.g. weather, as well as earthquakes). 
We have also been in contact with the school coordinator and course organisers for the Geoscience Outreach module at the University of Edinburgh and their advisors at Moray House (the university's Education Dept). They are interested in exploring how this proposal and equipment can relate to the recently revised Curriculum for Excellence in Scotland. We are expecting further advice on how to focus teaching materials towards the later stages of the teaching curriculum for astronomy, maths and computing.

The British Geological Survey Communications Team have extensive experience in publicising outreach projects through the BGS website, the British Science Festival, Science Uncovered at the Natural History Museum, and the various Open Days and Public Engagement events that are run at BGS sites throughout the year. For example, the Open Days in the Edinburgh and Keyworth offices typically attract more than 1000 visitors. 

This year marks the 200th anniversary of the Royal Astronomical Society who have initiated a large public outreach programme in celebration. As a partner, BGS can also advertise the instruments at their events to give school teachers an opportunity to see the instrument in action. The BGS Geomagnetism Team are part of the outreach initiatives in Scotland such as Bang goes the Borders, Lab in a Lorry and the Edinburgh Science Festival. We also have contacts in University of Edinburgh SciFun project. These are all additional avenues for outreach.

One of the outcomes of the project is to provide data free to whomsoever wishes. The data will be available on the web to other students, researchers and citizen scientists alike. We can also provide tie in with space weather community and other researchers in the field through networking at international conferences such as the annual ESA-sponsored Space Weather Workshop in Belgium and the annual National Astronomy Meeting (NAM) in the UK. Posters advertising the data and access will be submitted to make researchers aware of the new resources. Lancaster University and BGS have plenty of experience of providing magnetic field datasets through web portals and other interfaces to scientific researchers. As noted previously, additional software tools will be provided to enhance the analysis of the data.

We will aim to advertise the new system and network via social media including the Twitter and Facebook accounts of the various partners: at BGS, Lancaster and the schools that accept the system. We will produce an article for the BGS blog and an announcement on the BGS front webpage and geomagnetism webpages. We will also seek a commission for an article in a publication such as the RAS Astronomy and Geophysics magazine and within the Institute of Physics publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9998</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visits: Benbecula, Vale Of Leven Academy, Norwich, Oundle, Broxburn</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F51A91FA-2EC5-4DBC-BF6D-3660A7759ED0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over the course of 2016 I visited and installed school magnetometers in five schools across the UK, speaking to pupils and teachers about space weather and how we can use magnetometers on the ground to detect these changes in the magnetic field due to the electric currents in the atmosphere.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Girls in Physics</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>437BA83F-B369-4BBD-B17F-97DC4C662209</gtr:id><gtr:impact>80 pupils attending an IOP run day to encourage secondary school girls into Physics and related disciplines.
