Prevention of this mode of transmission (pMTCT) is a key element in global HIV prevention and the World Health Organisation has recommended that pMTCT of HIV infection should be prioritized in sub-Saharan Africa.
Evidence-based interventions to reduce MTCT are available in many maternity units in Africa, but their uptake is poor. The barriers to uptake are closely linked with the role of the male partners in perinatal care of the woman. It is known that men are the primary decision makers in many African countries where pMTCT is offered. Studies show that women are more likely to (a) undergo HIV testing, (b) disclose their HIV status to their husband, (c) adhere to treatment during pregnancy (d) deliver in a pMTCT facility and, (e) comply with infant feeding recommendations if their partners are engaged in the pMTCT programme. While male participation has a potentially positive impact on the uptake of pMTCT interventions, initiatives to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa have focused overwhelmingly on women, to the unintended exclusion of their male partners. The actual impact of male involvement is unknown, as there is a lack of quantitative data on the benefits and effectiveness of male partner engagement. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis found only one eligible study that assessed the effectiveness of male involvement in improving women's uptake of pMTCT services, and that study only focused on one part of the perinatal pMTCT cascade. While male involvement holds promise for improving uptake of pMTCT interventions, further rigorous evaluation and implementation research is needed.

Efforts in this direction must, however, begin by addressing conceptual and methodological issues in the study and implementation of male partner involvement in pMTCT. A uniform definition of male participation in pMTCT programmes does not exist, and there are no standardized measures or reliable indicators of male involvement. Also needed is a reconceptualisation of the role of men in pMTCT. It has been argued that to maximize the health outcomes of pMTCT programs, men should not be seen as simply &amp;quot;facilitating factors&amp;quot; that enable women to access health-care services, but be recognized as a constituent part of reproductive health policy and practice. Also, efforts to include male partners in HIV prevention for women have focused primarily on engaging men to support their female partners in adopting a prevention strategy, without also offering broader consideration for men's own health needs or of a social agenda aimed at promoting greater sex equality.

In a future study we propose to undertake a randomised controlled trial to assess a multi-component family-centred intervention. The hypothesis for the trial is that implementation of the intervention would result in improved uptake of pMTCT programmes in the intervention arm compared with the control arm. Before embarking on the trial, we propose to undertake development work (the current study) that will devise a programme of engagement of partners (i.e. the multi-component EPiC-pMTCT intervention) based on evidence in the literature and qualitative data from this study, and also assess the feasibility of conducting the cluster randomised controlled trial. The results from this development work will also inform the selection of centres that will participate in the proposed trial if it is deemed feasible.

The outputs from this research will comprise a synthesis of the evidence on barriers to male engagement in pMTCT, an analysis of the perspectives of men, women, health professionals and policy makers on male engagement, an intervention package, and a report on the feasibility of collecting the data required for the trial.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>HIV/AIDS is a major public health issue in Africa and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) accounts for about 10% of the national HIV burden in African countries [1]. Prevention of this transmission is a key element in global HIV prevention. The effectiveness of various pMTCT interventions has been demonstrated in resource-constrained settings, but the majority of women still do not access these services, even where infrastructure and services are in place. Effective strategies for the upscale of pMTCT services are urgently needed. Qualitative studies have identified barriers at various levels to the uptake of pMTCT services [2,3]. Many of the barriers are closely linked with the role of the male partners. Women are more likely to utilise the services if their partners are engaged in the pMTCT programme. On the other hand, fear of the negative consequences of HIV status disclosure (intimate partner violence, abandonment, loss of financial support) stops disempowered women from accessing pMTCT services [4]. We plan to test the hypothesis that implementation of a multi-component intervention to enhance the constructive engagement of partners would result in improved uptake of pMTCT programmes. This is a complex intervention and the current proposal is for the development phase which will devise a programme of engagement of partners based on evidence in the literature and on qualitative data derived from this research, and also assess the feasibility of conducting the randomised controlled trial. The work will comprise four elements: (1) synthesis of the evidence (2) qualitative exploration of the perspectives of men, women, health professionals, managers and policy makers (3) observational cohort study to assess the feasibility of data collection and (4) synthesis of all elements and refinement of the intervention. The results from this development work will also inform the selection of centres that will participate in the proposed trial if it is deemed feasible.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Social impact:
The research responds to the global declaration that 'efforts must be taken to secure the involvement and support of men' in all aspects of pMTCT programs and to address gender related discrimination that impedes service access and uptake [15]. The research will potentially enhance social mobilisation in the communities concerned, by generating awareness, and helping to reduce stigma, inducing communities to address gender inequality issues. The outputs of this development research will be of benefit to pregnant women and their families, the local communities, the global community, policy makers and service managers at local, national and international levels, and the research community.

Pregnant women will benefit from the project as a result of enhanced access to complete antenatal care, including services for the prevention of HIV/AIDS. It is anticipated that more couples will undergo HIV testing (whether as couples or individually) and the early detection of HIV positive women and men should help reduce the burden of HIV in the community. Community-level factors, particularly stigma, that have been identified as barriers to uptake of pMTCT services will be addressed in this research [16].
The family-centred approach underpinning this research could also potentially promote social cohesion in the community. 

Qualitative studies in East and southern Africa show that the way in which antenatal servies generally, and pMTCT programmes in particular, are organised constitutes a barrier to male engagement [2,17,18]. The attitudes of health professionals and absence of a 'male-friendly space' within the programmes have been identified as barriers. This research will be beneficial to programme managers in planning and delivery more inclusive and user-friendly services.

It has been argued that to maximize the health outcomes of pMTCT programs, men should not be seen as simply &amp;quot;facilitating factors&amp;quot; that enable women to access health-care services, but be recognized as a constituent part of reproductive health policy and practice [18]. Also, efforts to include male partners in HIV prevention services for women have focused primarily on engaging men to support their female partners in adopting a prevention strategy, without also offering broader consideration for men's own health needs or of a social agenda aimed at promoting greater sex equality. This research will therefore be beneficial to policy makers.

Economic impact:
It is arguable that high HIV prevalence is one of the most potent threats to economic development in eastern and southern Africa where this research is taking place. The contributions of both women and men to the local economy, and their ability to meeet the needs of their children, are diminished if they suffer HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Engaging male partners in pMTCT could have a major impact on the local and national economy and we hope to explore this in the proposed trial.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84661</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with key policymaker</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>785E28F4-FF8F-4C8B-8D8A-3811F91B59AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three UK-based researchers accompanied by the local principal investigator met with the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health in Lilongwe, Malawi.
