As the population ages, the numbers affected will increase considerably. A major challenge is how to provide high-quality treatment and support to these individuals in ways that are valuable to them, and at a cost considered by society to be affordable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MODEM aims to generate new evidence to inform policy and practice so as to better meet needs, promote the wellbeing of people with dementia and their carers, and achieve efficiency in the use of resources.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will start in March 2014 and last four years. It involves researchers from the London School of Economics and Political Science, Universities of Southampton, Newcastle and Sussex, and the International Longevity Centre-UK.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MODEM will develop a comprehensive set of models to estimate current and future needs, outcomes and costs, drawing on methods from a range of disciplines, with the involvement of people with dementia and their carers. An important outcome will be a publicly available legacy model for others to use. Individuals and stakeholders will be able to make their own projections of needs for care and support.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will generate unusually rich insights into the needs and circumstances of people with dementia over future decades, the health and wellbeing consequences of a range of interventions, and cost implications across all relevant budgets. These insights (made available as far as possible during the study) will be of relevance to national and local decision-makers, people with dementia, families and the public. We plan continuous, informative engagement with relevant communities. Inputs from our Advisory and Reference Groups will be key. 

We will also establish an Impact Advisory Group, composed of chief executives and/or public policy leads of a range of key public and other bodies (e.g. relevant royal colleges, DH, Alzheimer's Society, Age UK, Carers UK). This high-level group will meet to discuss key project milestones, helping us to tailor our work to ensure effective translation for policy discussion and service development, with the aim of improving the lives of people with dementia and carers. 

We will seek dialogue with some Councils (and ADASS and LGA) to discuss what they and partner Clinical Commissioning Groups would find helpful to assist in planning public health, health and social care interventions. Links to the NHS Commissioning Board, Public Health England and Think Local Act Personal will be important too.

We will present findings at regular intervals to stakeholders and to brief relevant parliamentary committees, all party parliamentary groups, parliamentary inquiries, relevant consultations and non-governmental stakeholders. We have good experience of this (e.g. our earlier macro-simulation models have been instrumental in guiding government thought in the area of need for and cost of long term care through the DH and in evidence to the House of Commons Health Committee, Dilnot Commission on the Funding of Care and Support, and the House of Lords Select Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change). Interim findings will be discussed with research users and put in the public domain as soon as possible via briefing notes and discussion papers. External designers will help us produce infographics and visual representations within texts. We will disseminate interim findings through a dedicated blog and tweets. We will assess research impact by asking stakeholders how well our interim/final findings, and in due course the model made publicly available, have assisted policy development and planning of services. We will track citations to our work (policy documents, parliamentary reports, media).

At the end of the project, we will produce a range of outputs: 

- a policy-based report outlining findings and associated implications for next steps

- an overall project summary and guide for the wider public, connecting research findings to the everyday life and challenges of people with dementia, families and carers. This will include infographics, pictures and real-life testimonials to contextualise and humanise the academic evidence. We will look to use animation in the form of the RSA's 'Animate' series; it would be uploaded to relevant websites and social media sites

- the web-based interactive legacy model will be free to use by commissioners, providers, researchers and general public

- we will hold seminars with stakeholders and experts during the project to present interim findings and discuss scenarios for modelling. We will hold a major event at the end of the project to present findings to central and local government, voluntary organisations, people with dementia, carers and academics. We will present our findings at seminars and conferences arranged by others.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2613207</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Systematic mapping of the evidence on what works on dementia: Presentation at ILPN 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BE0AB219-C488-440D-A136-7CA2B7E85FBB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation by David McDaid on Systematic mapping of the evidence on what works on dementia: who researches what? as part of an organised session at the International Long-term Care Policy Network's 2016 Conference in London on Tuesday 6 September 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Israel Ministry of Health</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>042192E6-AC29-4B9D-9C73-AF00BB362A0A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Raphael Wittenberg presented on the MODEM project at the Israel Ministry of Health on 21 June 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation on technology in dementia care and support at ILPN 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BBCA3FE7-87DE-4399-8E2F-7970CEB64454</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at the International Long-term Care Policy Network's conference in September 2016 on barriers to wider use of technology in dementia care and support.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation - The evidence and economic case for post diagnostic support for people with dementia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C959842A-F233-49C7-8E4A-5189762EBC1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation by Raphael Wittenberg to the Strategic Clinical Network Dementia and Neurological Conditions meeting on the evidence and economic case for post diagnostic support for people with dementia.

In the afternoon people from various local organisations involved in dementia care talked to us about the local support available. This was followed by a tea party for invited guests, including people with dementia attending the centre, their carers, three borough councillors, and professionals including Dr Dagmar Zeuner, Director of Public Health at the London Borough of Richmond, and Aileen Jackson, the Commissioning Manager responsible for commissioning dementia services. During the tea party the MODEM research project was presented and all those attending where able to share their experiences and ask questions.
The research team were able to experience first hand what happens in a day centre for people with dementia and were able to interact with both people with dementia and professional carers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/healthandsocialcare/2015/11/26/a-day-in-the-life-of-people-with-dementia/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Consultation meeting with the Alzheimer's Society</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DBC313E-2CDF-44A4-9952-8C26BA0CCFE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Adelina Comas-Herrera (researcher) and Fergus Bisset (website designer) met representatives of different departments of the Alzheimer's Society to demonstrate an early version of the Dementia Evidence Toolkit website and to obtain feedback on various questions to make sure that the final version of the toolkit is as useful as possible.

Research papers are in development for some aspects of the work. Three areas where findings have been published are set out below. A further additional piece of work (the Dementia Evidence Toolkit) was also launched and details are included below. 

1) Risk factors of cognitive impairment 

Interim findings suggest that the social activities of individuals and their social networks help to maintain steady levels of cognition, in addition to their education. The Social Participation work package (WP5) explored the characteristics influencing cognition at the age of 50. Researchers led by Dr Jitka Pikhartova and Professor Ann Bowling from the University of Southampton used data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) - a longitudinal data set which follows the lives of 17,000 adults born in a single week in 1958. The team investigated a hypothesis drawn from the literature, that the following factors might be associated with cognition at 50 years old: health behaviours, social support and social net in adolescence, and socio-economic characteristics during childhood and adulthood. They used linear regression in multivariable analysis to explore the independent associations between possible risk factors and cognition at age of 50. Positive associations with cognition were found with participation in civic activities at the age of 33 and 50, frequent participation in sporting activities at age 42, highest achieved qualification, and being female. On the other hand, having a manually working father at age of 11 and having at least 2 family members to whom respondents could turn for advice at the age of 33 were negatively associated with cognitive outcomes. 

2) Fertility history and cognition in later life 

Using data from the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA), Dr Sanna Read and Professor Emily Grundy from the London School of Economics and Political Science looked at the level and changes in cognition (memory and word fluency) over an 8-year period among women and men aged 50 or more at the start of the study. They assessed how cognition was associated with number of children (0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 children), early parenthood (before age 20 for women and 23 for men) and late parenthood (after age 35 for women and 39 for men). Previous work on parenthood and cognition has mainly focused on women only and a narrow range of physiological effects, especially hormonal factors. The novelty in this study was to include both men and women and widen the scope to consider the role of socio-economic position, health and social factors in the association. Findings reveal that family building history has both negative and positive effects on cognition in later life. Large family size and early parenthood were associated with poorer cognitive functioning in both men and women, following a similar pattern as found previously for other health outcomes. Poorer cognitive functioning in these cases resulted from negative pathways between early parenting, larger family size and poorer socioeconomic position, which further affect health and social engagement in later life. The benefits of parenting on cognition were also evident; parents had higher cognitive functioning than childless men and women. Moreover, those women who experienced their last birth after turning 35 also exhibited higher cognitive functioning in later life. Although some of these benefits were due to better socioeconomic position, health and social engagement, these background factors did not fully explain why parenthood and cognition was positively associated. 

3) Technology-based tools and services for people with dementia and carers 

The project collaborated with the Department of Health's Policy Innovation Research Unit to identify how technologies fit within the dementia care pathway, by conducting a scoping review of digital technology, robotics and other technology (as relevant) in the care and support of people with dementia and/or their unpaid family and other carers, and supplementing this with experiential information gathered from people with dementia and carers, and interviews with experts in the field. The research found that the largest number of technologies identified aim to enhance the safety and security of people with dementia living in the community. These devices are often passive monitors, such as smoke detectors. Other safety interventions, such as panic buttons, require active intervention. The second largest number of interventions aims to enhance people's memory and includes global positioning systems devices and voice prompts. These technologies mostly target people in the early stages of dementia. A third group focusing on treatment and care delivery emerged from the literature. These interventions focus on technology-aided reminiscence or therapeutic aspects of care for people with dementia and their carers. While the review found a range of technologies available for people with dementia and carers there is very little evidence of widespread practical application. Instead, it appears that stakeholders frequently rely on everyday technologies re-purposed to meet their needs. 

4) Dementia Evidence Toolkit 

Additional funding was provided by the ESRC to support the project to build on our systematic mapping of the literature on effectiveness of interventions in dementia to develop an evidence library. The Dementia Evidence Toolkit was launched in July 2016 and is a web-based resource consisting of: a searchable coded bibliographic database of 3000 empirical papers and 700 systematic reviews on interventions for the treatment, care and support of people with dementia and carers, comprising the period between 2009 and June 2015; and plain language summaries of the evidence on the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of key care and treatment interventions. 

The aim of the Toolkit is to provide easy access to scientific evidence of dementia care and treatment and to provide clear and rigorous information to people living with dementia, family and other unpaid carers, staff working in the health and social care sectors, local and strategic decision-makers and researchers. The toolkit has evaluated the evidence base for typical interventions in use in the UK: Advance Care Planning, STAR, Maintenance Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, Music Therapy and START: Strategies for Relatives. These interventions were found to be cost-effective, and further detailed information is available on the Toolkit website.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The three areas of research outlined above are contributing to other workpackages within the MODEM project. 

The Toolkit is already proving very useful for others. The resources in this toolkit will make it easier for commissioners and providers to develop services based on evidence; it will be possible to compare and contrast interventions in respect of outcomes such as quality of life or cognition and their costs. People affected by dementia will be able to learn about which types of care, treatments or services could potentially improve their lives. At the launch event held in July 2016, Jeremy Hughes CEO of the Alzheimer's Society said that 'There is an on-going need to understand better the way people continue to live well and live as well as possible with dementia in society today. The Toolkit puts all that evidence together in an accessible and usable way in the public domain'. In just four months, the Toolkit had 7,029 visits and 9,155 searches. Of the 1,790 people, across 80 countries, who indicated who they are, 297 were researchers, 179 carers, 84 social workers, 82 commissioners, 73 GPs, 20 people with dementia, and 1,055 others - demonstrating the breadth of reach for the resource. We are in discussion with funders about developing the Toolkit further.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DC6B16E0-FC8B-4217-AEE7-698685018ABB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.modem-dementia.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advice for Prime Minister's Challenge on Dementia 2020: Implementation Plan</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>665EDBF1-880C-4F37-99FF-647A477312AA</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of DH Advisory Group on Dementia Research</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D14DFBC0-6243-46B8-B56E-2DA140B23365</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of World Dementia Council</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A6E292B-7A7E-4C39-8EC8-B70135703754</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in the Future Support in Later Life Workshop, organised by GO Science and the Cabinet Office.
