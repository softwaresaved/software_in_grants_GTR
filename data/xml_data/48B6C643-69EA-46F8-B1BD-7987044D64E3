telomerase</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0800081</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In humans, the capacity to replenish the genetic material at the ends of our chromosomes (called telomeres) is limited, and often declines with age. Only certain tissues within our bodies possess the capacity to maintain or increase the telomere structure that protects our chromosomes from instability, akin to a shoelace aglet (or cap ) that prevents shoelaces from fraying. This capacity is encoded by a cellular protein, termed telomerase. How telomerase is able to maintain telomere length and structure in some tissues, but not others, is not completely understood. For example, in some tissues, telomerase is active but is inadequate to prevent telomere fraying. This proposal aims to uncover the novel activities, both within the telomerase protein itself, and in proteins that associate with telomerase, in promoting the maintenance and replenishment of telomeres. We hypothesize that these partially understood protein activities play a crucial role in helping to tether the telomerase activity to the telomere. Thus, a deeper understanding of these activities may shed insight into telomere integrity, and its importance in the health of cells and tissues as we age.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Telomeres comprise the repetitive regions of DNA and associated proteins found at chromosomal termini, and their protection from recognition as DNA damage or a DNA break is essential to genome stability and cell viability. In all but a few eukaryotic species, telomeres are maintained by telomerase, a specialized polymerase that utilizes an internal RNA component (TER) and a reverse transcriptase (TERT) to copy telomeric sequence onto chromosome ends in vivo. Telomerase activity is essential for the long-term replicative capacity of both normal and cancer cells, and its dosage appears to regulate the extent of telomere maintenance. Despite the fact that telomerase possesses two other conserved activities (a telomere DNA binding activity separate from its catalytic centre, and a nucleolytic activity), very little is understood about the role of these activities in vivo. We postulate that these activities, both within TERT itself and in TERT-associated subunits (in particular one termed hEST1A), will play a key role in the ability of telomerase to maintain telomere length and integrity. By determining the functional significance of these activities at the mammalian telomere, we aim to uncover novel physiological regulatory mechanisms of telomere maintenance that may have broader implications for chromosome stability and DNA repair.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>718686</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute for Ageing and Health</gtr:department><gtr:description>Telomerase and Rad52 independant survival</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD1B1EF9-573C-4C2A-AA71-27D91CE8B94B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The identification lead to publication of a rare yeast survival mechanism.
