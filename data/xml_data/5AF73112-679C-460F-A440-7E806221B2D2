Earth observation (EO) combined with socio-economic data can help better inform planning to optimise the sustainable use of the natural environment for economic growth and conservation efforts. Use of socio-economic analysis can also ensure that analysis at different spatial scales can be performed addressing distributional, resilience and vulnerability issues at community level. 

Marine spatial plans are being used to inform decisions of where to locate and co-locate various economic and conservation activities in the marine environment. However, they are currently compiled in isolation of EO data which could provide critical temporal and spatial information of, for example, water quality, chlorophyll concentration, presence of harmful algal blooms (HAB), sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean fronts. These data could be used, alongside other satellite data, including the monitoring of fishing vessels and shipping movements, to: evaluate whether current activities are most efficiently located from an environmental perspective; identify potential areas for further economic development in marine industries, such as power generation, aquaculture, and tourism, and; improve identification of areas for the protection of outstanding marine quality and designation of marine reserves. 

Social science can then be used to translate these development options into economic (e.g. estimation of job creation, revenue generation, distribution of benefits within coastal communities, level of diversification of industries) and social (e.g. highlighting importance of sense of place, cultural identity, social cohesion) impacts to assist in the decisions of which development options to pursue. These outputs will provide information to support evidence-based governance at the national and local levels as well as aiding stakeholder participation in decisions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The applicant will engage with a range of stakeholders for the whole duration of the project. This will be accomplished by interviews to explore end-user preferences for the types of datasets being collated and the socio-economic assessments proposed. A workshop will also be held to showcase the visualisation tool that will be modified to allow end-users to access the Earth observation and socio-economic data sets for their individual uses. Participants in both the interviews and the workshop will be drawn from government departments, executive non-departmental public bodies, businesses, industry representatives and conservation bodies who have an interest in mariculture, coastal tourism, offshore renewable energy, marine planning and marine conservation. 

The project aims to foster the use of Earth observation and socio-economic data in decision making for marine planning, regulating and day-to-day operational decisions to ensure sustainable blue growth. In this respect it hopes to identify new applications of these data sets and satellite services for end-users to assist in job generation and maintenance, reduced operational costs, the provision of a healthy natural environment, and more equable distribution of wealth.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>115941</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Attendance at Aquaculture Common Issues Group</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3CD5E9F-B050-4D51-8973-AE7830704F4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Aquaculture Common Issues Group brings together aquaculture farmers, policy makers, researchers and funding bodies to discuss current issues and possible solutions.

Engagements conducted during the knowledge exchange fellowship encouraged learning by stakeholders in understanding the different datasets and how they could be used for stakeholders' purposes. This learning benefit and increase in knowledge was clearly seen in participants at an individual level at a project workshop held in November 2015 measured using pre- and post-workshop questionnaires.

Two other workshops in Norwich (2016) and Poole (2017) highlighted the willingness of participants to work across sectors to tackle problems in the aquaculture sectors such as (i) moving farms offshore and (ii) the socio-economic impacts associated with aquaculture. These workshops encouraged interdisciplinary and collaborative networks to form which are further strengthening the UK's capacity and capability to solve problems from a holistic ecosystem approach. Participants of the workshops will be continuing to work together to produce two articles for publication summarising the insights of the discussions and published for a wider audience.

Integration of EO and socio-economic data and information for the aquaculture sector can help increase the effectiveness of public services and enhance quality of life. A successful workshop in South Africa brought together end-users across the aquaculture business and government departments responsible for aquaculture growth. Discussion was facilitated to enable each end-user to identify the type of information derived from EO and socio-economic data that would be useful to them. Included were data to help (i) policy departments' become more effective in regulating and monitoring the South African aquaculture sector and (ii) aquaculture businesses to reduce and manage risk by providing early warning systems of, for instance, harmful algal blooms. The socio-economic context of a sustainable aquaculture sector is also necessary in attaining targets under the Sustainable Development Goals for South Africa and this will need to be further developed into the future. The work carried out in South Africa has also increased knowledge of myself, the KE fellow, by providing me with insight and access to an alternative context and priorities which requires data to be presented differently to address specific issues.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>19476345-F922-4B5C-B77E-E7FEB09C58D9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This knowledge exchange (KE) fellowship in total had a number of aims including: bringing together relevant Earth observation (EO) and socio-economic databases, providing an interactive visualisation tool of their content, showing how the tool can be used to carry out socio-economic analysis and exploring the potential of offshore aquaculture in UK waters. In fulfilling these objectives I carried out a number of interviews with a range of stakeholders in each of the four UK home countries including: aquaculture farmers, social scientists, offshore renewable businesses, offshore oil &amp;amp; gas decommissioning networks and the nature conservation sector. 

The KE fellowship facilitated use of the EO databases by stakeholders who were not familiar with its existence or application. For instance, aquaculture farmers identified the added value using EO chlorophyll concentration data alongside other important variables to inform where new farms could be located. The social scientist recognised the potential of EO data combined with socio-economic data to inform their research and assist in generating new research questions. For instance, one social scientist identified the opportunity to question people's perception of the marine environment and their use of it by overlaying suspended particulate matter (SPM) data with water quality information. Overlaying EO, socio-economic and other environmental data was also seen as advantageous by the conservation sector by helping to provide further understanding of the reasons behind the movement and state of particular species. Examples of possible conservation applications included correlating chlorophyll concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) with basking shark and jellyfish movements. The offshore renewable sector also identified a number of EO applications for their industry including monitoring the environmental impacts of offshore wind farms (OWF) before and after construction. The potential for using offshore decommissioned oil &amp;amp; gas platforms for aquaculture farms was explored through one-to-one interviews and workshops. Across practitioners and experts from a range of backgrounds, it was concluded that the risk and cost of moving offshore is a barrier in itself without the introduction of offshore structures which would need additional maintenance and are not fit-for-purpose. As an outcome of the discussions, it was queried whether future offshore oil &amp;amp; gas platforms should not be built for decommissioning but for repurposing. 

Earth observation data can potentially provide relevant information over a range of stakeholders. However, one resounding comment from all stakeholders is that an understanding of what the images are actually presenting is required. As questioned by a number of stakeholders, does high chlorophyll concentration represent productive waters or could it also be showing the more damaging state of eutrophication. Similarly with SPM plumes around the foundations of offshore wind turbines, a clearer understanding of whether these are caused by local sediment movement or whether the sediment has been transported naturally from somewhere else will have varying implications. There is also the challenge of disparate temporal and spatial resolution between EO and socio-economic datasets. Satellite and associated Earth observation data are becoming ever more sophisticated in the frequency of images produced (e.g. 1 day revisits) and high resolutions such as 10m from the new Sentinel 2A satellite. This is quite clearly at odds with the data collected by social scientists which range between quarterly and yearly data points and often at aggregation levels which span 1,500 people to national scales of 64 million people. These challenges provide opportunities, identified by the stakeholders, as new areas of research to be explored and new metrics to be developed. Collaborating with international partners is one way to overcome these shortfalls and explore alternative perspectives. Interviews and a workshop held in South Africa as part of the fellowship highlighted the same demand for data that provides a holistic assessment of alternative planning options for growing its aquaculture sector. South Africa's focus on freshwater and on-land aquaculture requires though different refinements to the data and its more ready application to the Sustainable Development Goals. 

The web-based, interactive visualising tool developed during the KE fellowship to host the cross-disciplinary data, has also been useful in facilitating discussions of alternative analysis and highlighting data gaps. The tool was used in a dedicated workshop where aquaculture representatives, recreational activities representatives, sociologists, environmental economists, funding representatives and Earth observation scientists were invited to explore the potential of combining these databases. The workshop was positive in facilitating discussions, creating the opportunity for attendees to collaborate in the future and contribute to increased knowledge. An additional two workshops were held that brought together a range of stakeholders and experts to discuss (i) the use of offshore oil &amp;amp; gas platforms for offshore aquaculture and (ii) the socio-economic impact of aquaculture currently and into the future.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The knowledge exchange fellowship, through its interviews and workshops with stakeholders demonstrated how Earth observation (EO), economic and social data can be used separately, as well as combined, to inform policy and business decisions as well as contribute to innovative, interdisciplinary research. The development of the web-based interactive tool allows stakeholders to freely access data to further explore applications and research possibilities. As noted above, there are real and immediate uses of the data by aquaculture farmers and their understanding of changes in local and regional waters; nature conservationists can map changes in habitats and ecosystem services to better target their efforts; social scientists' could enhance their research from a spatial perspective; while offshore oil &amp;amp; gas decommissioning agents could work towards repurposing offshore platforms. Further engagement activities, including publications in trade magazines, newsletters, blogs and peer-reviewed journals, are being pursued to further encourage the uptake of the data, use of the visualisation tool and approaches.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C10C3F26-532B-46EF-A01E-E5BB299BAD64</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://marineprosperity.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N013786/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA017EDD-C008-4338-ABE2-A7D9EEA68E82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
