The transition over the last fifty years from a Europe of nation-states to the confederal entity of today has had the consequence that the term &amp;quot;Europeanization&amp;quot; is one used indiscriminately to describe a wide variety of economic, political and social trends which have contributed to the creation of a united Europe. For historians, however, the term &amp;quot;Europeanization&amp;quot; is one that presents a number of problems. 
Where, for example, should we search for its origins? Is it a single process or one which has advanced in fundamentally dissimilar ways across different aspects of European history? And, perhaps more importantly, how should we decide what we are looking for? 
These are the issues of historical conceptualisation that lie at the heart of this innovative research collaboration between an Oxford and Berlin-based team of historians. This is not, it must be stressed, another project on the origins of the European Union. Historians have well demonstrated just how complex and almost accidental was that process. There was no irresistible trajectory that led Europe through the acronym soup of the OEEC, ECSC and EEC to the EU. 
If therefore the essential role of historians is to reclaim the history of the European Union from the teleological generalisations current in a number of other disciplines, the problem arises whether historians should be similarly sceptical about concepts such as &amp;quot;Europeanization&amp;quot;. 
By examining the history of contemporary Europe from the late nineteenth century to the present day, this research project will provide the first serious examination by historians of &amp;quot;Europeanization&amp;quot;. 
Our ambition is twofold. Firstly, we wish to launch a debate among historians, but also reaching out to the, disciplines and a wider public audience, on what &amp;quot;Europeanization&amp;quot; might actually mean, and how it might be distinguished from other processes of trans-national transfer which we have become accustomed to describe as &amp;quot;Americanization&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Westernization&amp;quot;. Secondly, we wish to explore &amp;quot;Europeanization&amp;quot; by taking a number of case studies of economic, political and cultural change across Europe during the twentieth century and examining how far such processes can be meaningfully located within the conceptual framework of &amp;quot;Europeanization&amp;quot;. 
We are historians, and our approach will be historical. This does not however imply a reluctance to engage with other disciplines. On the contrary we see our role as to bring a historical dimension to the current wide public debate about &amp;quot;Europeanization&amp;quot;. At the same time, however, we also see the role of this project as encouraging a more critical reflection and debate among historians about how far there is a European shape to the twentieth century. 
Historians, it is commonly remarked, have remained remarkably rooted within the structures of national debates and narratives. By bringing together a German and British group of predominantly younger historians to work on the question of &amp;quot;Europeanization&amp;quot;, we therefore wish to demonstrate the virtues of a trans&amp;shy; national approach to the writing of contemporary history, but also to influence how historians think about Europe's recent past.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25090</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our work is regularly cited in other studies of processes of Europeanization, including importantly by historians who are sceptical as to whether any homogeneous process of Europeanization can be identified.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>41708266-39E3-4154-8BE3-829EEAA23671</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Working with my Co-I Kiran Patel now at the University of Maastricht we developed what we regard as the first properly-grounded historical model of processes of Europeanization, which avoids some of the pitfalls which we associate with presentist accounts of the process.
