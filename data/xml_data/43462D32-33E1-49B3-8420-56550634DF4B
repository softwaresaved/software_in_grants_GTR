They are more likely to expose their own children to maltreatment. The problems arise from a complicated mix of genetic and environmental influences, in which key factors probably include, prenatal stress, early infant emotionality, and harsh parenting as risks, and warm parenting as protective factors. There is now good evidence that individual variations and environmental exposures in early life contribute to risk for mental health problems in later childhood and beyond. However, previous research has been conducted almost exclusively in countries with Westernised standards of medical care and family arrangements, and where additional risks such as low birth weight and under-nutrition are rare. The aims of the proposed research are to study early risk and protective factors for childhood mental health problems, to identify prenatal and infancy risks that are common to Western and South Asian populations and those that are distinctive. Using a prospective longitudinal design we will recruit members of the new IMCR (Indian Council of Medical Research) funded South Indian PRAMM study (n= 650; Prospective Assessment of Maternal Mental Health study), currently being assessed at 3 timepoints during pregnancy to 8 weeks of age, into a new study of infant development with detailed assessment at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. We will use common measurement (questionnaires, interviews, observations and developmental assessments) between an existing UK Medical Research Council funded cohort, the Wirral Child Health and Development Study (WCHADS), and the Indian cohort, to enable data analyses to be conducted of merged UK - Indian datasets. Robust methods designed to facilitate cross-cultural comparability of measurement will be employed. Aspects of the prenatal and early postnatal environment such as maternal mental health, nutrition and patterns of early caregiving likely to be distinctively relevant to the South Asian setting with be assessed, and examined alongside factors identified in previously in predominantly Western research. Evidence for gene-environment interplay will also be evaluated in the prediction of early emotional and behavioural problems in infancy. This joint Uk-Indian study, together with a planned series of training events, will contribute to capacity building in the Indian clinical research domain by facilitating the sharing of experience and expertise in conducting longitudinal cohort studies, sampling and retention, measurement issues, data management and state of the art statistical methods needed in longitudinal analysis of complex data sets. The study findings in the longer term will directly inform the refinement of existing early interventions for child mental health in both Asian and UK settings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aims of the proposed research are to study early risk and protective factors for childhood mental health problems, to identify prenatal and infancy risks that are common to Western and South Asian populations and those that are distinctive.

The study findings on psychosocial and nutritional predictors of child mental health will inform the refinement of existing early interventions for child mental health in both UK and South Asian settings in the longer term.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate impact in three areas: 1) Advancement of the field of developmental psychopathology, 2) Capacity building of Indian researchers, and 3) Public health and policy. (See also Pathways to Impact statement). The findings will advance our understanding of how individual, family and environmental factors interact to effect multiple child outcomes, including physical, cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioural development. The research will lead to the development of common measures that can be used for future epidemiological and interventional studies in the South Asian and UK settings. The findings are likely to inform early interventions that can help prevent mental health problems in later childhood and adolescence, including substance misuse. The project will lead to the development of capacity in Indian researchers to conduct complex studies of this nature. Our close collaboration with a number of academic groups (see academic beneficiaries) have the potential to inform integrated interventions that holistically target physical, cognitive and socioemotional development. 

We plan to achieve maximum impact by actively engaging non-academic beneficiaries (families, the wider community, the voluntary sector and the media) through our existing links with such bodies, thereby raising public awareness and understanding of the development of childhood emotional, behavioural and developmental problems and achieving clinical and policy change. 

Scalable integrated interventions that address parental mental health, infant stimulation and nutrition have great potential to improve the developmental potential, physical and mental health of the children of India. Rahman, with his global expertise in early interventions, will work with Indian researchers to refine existing interventions to make them more effective and tailored to the Indian context. We plan to apply for further collaborative grants to develop, implement and evaluate interventions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>650773</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N000870/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>5841ECCD-C9B1-4B8B-993F-ACC8E9585125</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.1  Primary preventions interventions to modify behaviours or promote well-being</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>13981021-24EA-4648-A954-C235506E2CD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.2  Interventions to alter physical and biological environmental risks</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
