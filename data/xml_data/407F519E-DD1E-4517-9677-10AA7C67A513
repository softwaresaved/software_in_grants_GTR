In order to analyse these processes both material culture and literary texts are worthy of consideration. Texts help to reconstruct the discourse that was created around a specific place, whereas material culture reflects how the sense of holiness was physically rooted in the landscape. 

Although the concept of holy in Islam has been addressed in some publications, the aim of this specific project is to fill a gap in the scholarship by focusing on the strategies developed within Islam in order to make a site a holy place and legitimise its holiness and on the factors that led to places eventually losing their fame. 

Our approach, therefore, not only will engage theoretically with the notion of holiness in Islam but will also research how the sense of holiness activated specific sites and places. Within the project &amp;quot;Islam&amp;quot; is understood in a broad sense as the religious practice of the totality of Muslim elites, scholars, and commoners throughout Islamic history.

The network, based at the University of Edinburgh, will benefit from the active participation of the second main partner, the MIRI (Materiality in Islam research Initiative) directed by Professor Alan Walmsley at the University of Copenhagen. 
The project will be developed in three different meetings, each one addressing different issues. An initial conference (Edinburgh, September 2013) will focus on the early Islamic period and will try to establish the strategies and models of making sites holy in Islam and the factors facilitating or impeding the process. A follow-up workshop (Copenhagen, December 2013/January 2014) will produce a close analysis of specific case studies. The third and concluding conference (Edinburgh, June 2014) will address the possible recurrence of specific patterns throughout Islamic history or the occurrence of regional or temporal characteristics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The activities of the network will address scholars in a number of disciplines and institutions.
Part of the research activity is geared to a wide public audience: the public lecture at the end of the second conference in Edinburgh will be an effort to summarize the most relevant points discussed during the different meetings with a specific focus on how the theme &amp;quot;Holy places in Islam&amp;quot; can help in the contemporary understanding of Muslim culture. At the same time the website will convey to a wider public more detailed information about the research carried out by the network.
The conferences and the network will be all based on an interdisciplinary approach but each one will focus on specific themes. Edinburgh - in which a solid and renowned community of scholars working on the early Islamic period is based - will host the first conference on the early centuries and on the transformations carried out by the Muslim conquests. In Copenhagen - in which the MIRI initiative focus group is based, but where also The David Collection with its outstanding Islamic artworks is located - the workshop will deal with specific case studies. The much needed archaeological side of the research will be guaranteed by the MIRI initiative staff who have been working in the Middle East, including the Arabian Peninsula, for several years. Papers will circulate before the meeting and the greater part of the meeting will be dedicated to the discussion. Finally the third meeting in Edinburgh will help to engage with later periods and peripheral areas of the Islamic world. The Department of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies, devoted to Islamic history and civilization, and the Alwaleed Centre, whose aim is to promote an understanding of Islam through world-leading research and outreach activities, will help to frame the final conference and the public lecture within a consolidated tradition and ongoing series of events related to the Islamic world. 
In each case the network aims to consolidate and enrich diverse existent expertise which, because of the division among fields, gathers together only rarely.
The edited volume will crystallize the most important themes debated by the network: the aim is to have more than a collection of papers presented during the various meetings. The objective is to reflect the progression in the discussion across the three meetings as well as the methodologically new understanding of the importance of holiness in shaping the socially constructed landscape.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32925</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Copenhagen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Denmark, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>MIRI Copenhagen</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F68A8B8-C520-47CA-84C0-575EA5402A68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Funding to hold a workshop in Copenhagen was promised to partner but then withdrawn</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>n/a</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We established an international and interdisciplinary network of scholars working on various aspects of holy places in Islam. The two conferences held on the topic (December 2013, September 2014) showed that there is no single model that could explain why certain sites were accepted as holy places while others were not, and that several different processes were in place that influenced discourse on the holiness of specific sites. With regard to the often unclear use of the terms 'sacred', 'holy', 'blessed', or 'religious' for specific places, it became clear that this is not necessarily due to an uncritical or unreflected use of terminology, but also results from the different perceptions that individuals may have had of these places. 
A database of holy places has been developed and tested that will bring together data of holy places throughout the Muslim world, including a description of the sites, their history, the reasons for their being considered holy, connected figures or items, literature, images as well as researchers having worked on the sites.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The database will facilitate future research on holy places in Islam in that it brings together data from different disciplines and various regions and thus allows for the identification of transregional patterns, regional differences, or developments over time.
