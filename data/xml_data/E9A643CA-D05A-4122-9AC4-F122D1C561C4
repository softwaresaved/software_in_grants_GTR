Although the study was not designed or powered for clinical endpoints, in an adhoc analysis we found a significant decrease of clinical episodes of bacterial infections in both the mother (puerperal period) and the newborn (neonatal period) in the intervention arm. Azithromycin was safe for both the mothers and the newborns. 
As a follow-up to the former trial, we are conducting a multi-country phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial in which 12,500 women in labour will be randomised to receive either a single dose of 2g of oral azithromycin or placebo (ratio 1:1) to assess the effect of the intervention on neonatal mortality and maternal and neonatal sepsis. Recruitment will take place in two countries, The Gambia and Burkina Faso. 
Ancillary studies evaluating the impact on the intervention on antibiotic resistance are in progress.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The primary objective of the study is assess the effect of one oral dose of azithromycin (2g) given to women in labour on neonatal mortality (from birth to day 28).

In addition the trial will also evaluate the effect of the intervention on other clinical endpoints in both neonates and mothers, and on microbiological endpoints (prevalence of carriage and resistance):

Disability Adjusted Life Years prevented by the intervention.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our study will evaluate a novel approach for preventing an important proportion of maternal and neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The proposal has been developed in response to the current Sustainable Development Goal number 3 in which Maternal and Neonatal Health are global health priorities. The beneficiaries of the proposed intervention are women in labour attending health facilities for delivery and their offspring in SSA; they represents approximately two thirds of all deliveries occurring in The Gambia and in other SSA countries. The intervention is easy to implement (one dose of azithromycin given when the woman arrives at the health facility in labour) and low cost. 

Azithromycin has been used in several randomized trials and interventions with different purposes, showing the high potential of this drug to decrease morbidity and mortality. However, we believe that azithromycin given to women in labour can have an impact on neonatal outcomes. Such new concept has been explored by the proof-of-concept study we carried out in The Gambia, in which 829 women and their offspring were included. The proof-of-concept study was designed to assess the effect of the intervention on bacterial colonization in both the women and their babies. Besides the strong impact of colonization, the study showed also a decrease on clinical outcomes in mothers and babies in the intervention arm. However, the study was too small to determine the impact of the intervention on neonatal mortality and severe morbidity. Therefore, we are proposing an adequately powered trial that will specifically evaluate the effect of the intervention on clinical outcomes, including severe morbidity and mortality.

Beyond the potential impact on public health, this trial has the opportunity to expand academic knowledge on maternal and neonatal health. We will generate a large amount of data on risk factors for maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and on the aetiology of sepsis that can be prevented using innovative interventions. We will also learn if preventing infections during early life results into a better growth in infancy (another common cause of mortality) in SSA.

Building on the encouraging results of our proof-of-concept trial, the current trial includes social science, health systems research and a cost-effectiveness analysis. If the trial proves that neonatal sepsis and episodes of maternal or neonatal hospitalization and death can be prevented by a single administration of azithromycin to women in labour, we will evaluate the cost per episode prevented, the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention and the feasibility of implementing this new intervention into the current health system in SSA.

As the proposed study will be conducted in a poor-resource setting, capacity building will be an important component. This study will offer the opportunity for African medical doctors and laboratory-based staff to have hands-on training in research methods of infectious diseases and global health. All study staff will receive continuous training on clinical research, such as Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices and Ethics. In addition, we will include specific training sessions for the field staff; laboratory technicians will be working to the highest microbiological and scientific standards (the MRCG microbiology laboratory is the WHO reference for the West African region). 

Translation of research findings into practice would be facilitated by the inclusion of representatives of the Burkina and Gambian Ministries of Health. If the trial is successful, their support will be key for the involvement of international policy-makers and public health organizations to accelerate the intervention's scale up.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_EX_MR/P006949/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
