Examples of modern TE applications include portable refrigerators, beverage coolers, electronic component coolers, infrared sensing, etc. Possible future applications of TE devices include efficient conversion of waste heat into usable energy, in improving the efficiency of photovoltaic cells, etc. TE materials have been investigated for several decades due to their energy efficiency. The efficiency of TE materials is defined by the figure of merit quantity Z. It is customary to express the usefulness of a thermoelectric material in terms of the dimensionless quantity ZT, where T is temperature. Larger values of ZT require high Seebeck coefficient S, high electrical conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity can be contributed by both carriers and phonons. An increase in S normally implies a decrease in electrical conductivity, and an increase in the latter normally implies an increase in carrier thermal conductivity. Thus, it is very difficult to increase Z in typical TE materials. Clearly, for higher values of Z, we require materials which are characterised by less efficient scattering of electrons and efficient scattering of phonons. Research over the past several decades has shown that SiGe and Bi-chalcogenides are good high-temperature and low-temperature TE materials, respectively. It is being realised that material choice with reduced dimensionality is a prudent strategy for increasing ZT relative to bulk values. This is because low dimensionality provides four new features, each of which can be helpful in increasing ZT: (1) increase in electronic density of states near Fermi level; (2) anisotropic effective mass tensor and contribution from multiple Fermi-energy ellipsoids; (3) reduction in thermal conductivity by increasing phonon scattering at the barrier-well interfaces, without as large an increase in electron scattering at the interface; and (4) increased carrier mobility at a given carrier concentration when quantum confinement conditions are satisfied, so that modulation doping and delta-doping can be utilised to some extent. An attempt to increase ZT using feature (2) requires achieving low-dimensional growth in a manner that makes best use of the anisotropic nature of the effective mass tensor, and may not be easily controllable. In contrast, features (1) and (3) are considered to be controllable and very effective in increasing ZT. The quantum size effects offered by the consideration of feature (1) will increase electron density of states at Fermi level, and exploiting the boundary scattering effects by the consideration of feature (3) will substantially reduce the thermal conductivity without much loss to the electrical conductivity. This proposal seeks to identify the key parameters for developing the phonon engineering of Si-based nanocomposite thermoelectric materials by undertaking a systematic state-of-the-art theoretical study of their enhanced ZT over a wide temperature range. The proposed research will be based on four key theoretical ingredients, all of which have been developed by the PI: a first-principles approach (using the pseudopotential and density-functional theories) for equilibrium geometry, electronic states, and phonons; the adiabatic bond charge model for phonons in systems with larger unit cells; an anharmonic elastic continuum model to treat phonon-phonon interactions; and a model phonon conductivity theory. The systems are investigations will be: (i) thin Si/Ge and Si/SiGe superlattices, (ii) Si nanowires embedded in Ge and SiGe matrices, and (iii) Si nanodots embedded in a Ge or SiGe matrix. Our study will also help us identify the role of dimensionality in the enhancement of the thermodynamic figure of merit over a large temperature range.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will bring benefit to a wide range of stakeholders working in this and complementary research areas and whilst a lot of this could be regarded as indirect, this work is at the start of a relatively lengthy beneficiary trail. 1. The Research Group will add to its existing strengths through the appointment of a PDRA and thus will enable 2. the institution to increase its unique level of knowledge in theoretical research which embraces unique levels of expertise gained by the PI in two very distinct, and up until very recently regarded as separate topics, viz. the physics of electrons and of phonons (related to atomic vibrations). In addition, the PI will be able to extend his theories of phonon-phonon interactions and phonon conductivity of bulk semiconductors to nanocomposite systems. Although research in this field is being conducted in many international institutions, very few places conduct its full extent using trustworthy theoretical and computational methods. Our institution will be able to raise its profile amongst the leading research groups in the UK and the US, including MIT, Berkeley, and California. 3. Collaborators will benefit from new theoretical data making them better informed to conduct experimental research thus helping to improve on the prospects of obtaining results which currently can be considered qualitative at best. 4. Ultimately improvements in experimental work as a result of our theoretical work, after their experimental verification, will bring benefit to both the energy and semiconductor industries. Other key research groups will benefit as a result of our dissemination strategy. The UK will be able maintain its status as a world leader in ThermoElectric research. They will benefit 1. Through the development of a highly trained member of staff that will be able to continue developing research in this area either within the group or at another institution. 2. Dissemination will help to increase the likely opportunity to develop further interactions and collaborations with peers and raise awareness of the outputs amongst industry. 3. By informing international colleagues engaged in research Our Impact Plan consists of three distinct levels of dissemination: 1. To collaborators a. informing experimentalists about results and helping them to improve their outputs which will ultimately bring benefit to industry. b. Through the exploitation of existing links to potential collaborators in Brazil, Canada, USA, Japan, Turkey, India and elsewhere in the UK and Europe. Many of these existing links are ex-students and ex-postdoctoral fellows demonstrating a track record in research supervision 2. Broad dissemination. The PI will a. Work with peer groups to organise, host and present at specialised events / conferences and this is likely to be for an audience consisting of experts in the advanced thermoelectric community and related topics. For example, the PI is co-organising the symposium Phonon Engineering for Enhanced Materials Solutions -- Theory and Applications at the MRS Fall 2009 meeting in Boston during 30 Nov - 4 Dec, 2009. This event will have 12 invited talks, 44 oral talks, and 11 poster presentations, and will be attended by more than 300 delegates. b. Participate in future events organised by professional and scientific bodies such as the MRS which will inform a much wider audience of several hundred delegates and through professional groupings. c. Communication via the University's media and public relations office which actively promotes the institution's research and undertakes media training for research staff. 3. Publications in high impact journals, such as Phys. Rev. Lett. and Phys. Rev. B, enabling a very large number of readership to benefit. As a consequence of that, we expect to see benefit to the institution as raising the profile of the research is likely to help to identify and attract other potential collaborators.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>326408</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Thermoelectricity (TE) is the process of generating either electricity from heat engines or heating devices from electricity.

Our study will also help us identify the role of dimensionality in the enhancement of the thermodynamic figure of merit over a large temperature range.

The investigations made in the project showed, in agreement with some previous studies, that the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of a heavily doped Si-Ge alloy takes a maximum value of less than 1 at around 1000 K. Interestingly, it was predicted that for a heavily doped ultra-thin Si/Ge superlattice an enhancement in ZT to a value between 3 and 6 can be achieved over the broad temperature range 400-1200 K. It is hoped that this prediction can be experimentally verified in near future. The theory highlights the important role of increased phonon interface scatterings in ultrathin superlattices in achieving a significant reduction in the phonon conductivity. 

Some results have been presented at international conferences and published in high impact journals. The results obtained in the last period of the project are still being written up and will be submitted for publication. A detailed review of the role of phonons for improved thermoelectric properties is scheduled to be published in Rep. Prog.
