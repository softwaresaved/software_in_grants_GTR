G. Hopkins in 1973) that the behaviour of producers and traders in precolonial and colonial West Africa can be described as broadly 'rational' responses to the circumstances in which they found themselves: such as trading across cultural and political boundaries, and in a setting of relatively abundant land and scarce labour. Economically rational responses were manifested in certain characteristic institutions (such as the ethnic trading diaspora, facilitating cross-cultural trade), in choice of technique (land-extensive, labour-saving farming methods), and in the kinds of property and markets that did and did not exist (the late development of markets in land, in contrast to the frequency of slavery in the precolonial and early colonial periods).\nThe project, however, is a book examining the environmental, institutional and political influences that often complicated the relationship between the basic circumstances and the responses. 'Rational' responses to market incentives often took forms or yielded results different from those characteristic of perfectly competitive markets bounded by property regimes in which hectares are owned by individuals, and in which the latter are generally free to hire out their labour hours. Ethnic trading diasporas can be seen as institutions not only for making markets but also for securing 'rents' (i.e. above the profit rates obtainable in competitive markets); labour-saving appears not to have been a priority in handicrafts; the institutions of slavery and debt bondage, and arguably also certain gender and kinship arrangements, facilitated economic growth in parts of the region after the ending of the Atlantic slave trade and during the growth of export agriculture, but at heavy cost to others, and with mixed implications for subsequent development possibilities. \nThese issues have to be considered in the context of the political structures and agents which influenced the rules and the ways in which they were operated. Particularly important here is the question of how far colonial regimes promoted or retarded 'globalization': the integration of West Africans and their lands in world markets, and on Western terms. On this the book concludes that the most innovative contribution of colonial regimes in the West African context was the conversion of the labour and capital markets into forms that were ideologically acceptable in the international environment of the mid-twentieth century.\nThe analysis will be presented through a series of closely related essays, with a concluding essay drawing together the implications. The book will be written for a student and lay as well as faculty readership: in African history and African Studies, but with accessible implications for comparative and 'global' history.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23102</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E000487/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
