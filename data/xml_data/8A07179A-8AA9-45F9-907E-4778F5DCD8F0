In doing so, it also plans to draw on the related experience and expertise of researchers who have examined the same topic in Greece, Italy and Spain in Southern Europe. 
This Network will concentrate its efforts in two areas: 1) the interplay of economic structures, policies and institutions in determining women's access to employment and 2) the patterns of women's economic participation as key determinants of gender inequality and social inequality in general. Of central concern in the Middle East and North Africa (the MENA region) is the apparent contradiction that while the educational gaps between women and men have narrowed and women have experienced rapid declines in their fertility rates, female labour force participation (FLFP) rates remain the lowest of any region in the world. In the countries of South Asia, despite variations between countries, average rates are the third lowest in the world, after the Middle East and North Africa. 
Hence, one of the central concerns of this Network will be to help develop a research agenda that could contribute to explaining why female labour force participation rates are relatively low in these three regions despite their structural differences, and to leverage this contribution to help account for income inequality across households as well as across women themselves. The Southern European countries, particularly the three countries of Greece, Italy and Spain, are very interesting because they have a history of similar problems of social and gender inequalities and there is a rich literature upon which the researchers in this proposed Network could draw to help explain the nature of the historical trends in MENA and South Asia. 
The exploratory work of this proposed Network in the above eleven countries will concentrate on four major research-related questions. (1) What are the impediments to women's access to jobs? (2) What are the effects on the household-level well-being of women's lack of employment and income? (3) What is the relationship between gender inequality and labour-market segmentation and what is the effect of gender inequality on broader forms of social inequality and income inequality? (4) What are the data requirements for addressing such research issues and what information gaps need to be filled? 
In pursuing this agenda, our proposed Network will include researchers from academic and non-academic institutions (including NGOs) with vital and extensive experience in our area of focus. Included in these efforts will be PhD students as well as early career researchers. The Network members will constitute a multidisciplinary group, spanning the areas of economics, development studies, sociology, anthropology, demography, statistics and law.
These researchers will come together in three workshops, two in London and one in Cairo (the latter in collaboration with the ERF), in order to collectively and intensively discuss the relevant issues and explore potential areas of research on women's labour force participation and gender inequality. As a result of these discussions, the network researchers will be organised into thematic working groups whose members will maintain contact with one another between workshops and will contribute inputs into the Research Briefs and Final Report produced by the Network as a whole. 
Additional activities of this network will include organising panels at various international conferences and the active dissemination of the network's outputs to other interested researchers, NGOs and international institutions such as the World Bank, ILO &amp;amp; UN Women.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The creation of a multi-disciplinary international network with a focus on women's access to employment and the various dynamics of gender and social inequality across three world regions is likely to have a significant impact that can be transmitted through various channels. The network will build links between beneficiaries and the users of future research agendas; among those within the network itself; and between the network members and those outside it.
The immediate impact of the network will be through its non-academic participants. These participants from international NGOs and civil society organizations will be actively involved in shaping the network agenda and will be conduits for dissemination of the network's findings through their own local and transnational networks, including women's organizations and trade unions; contacts within government agencies and women's policy agencies; national, regional and international research institutes; and local offices of the World Bank and UN agencies. 
Project participants with experience of working on gender and employment issues in international or civil society organisations include: Shahrashoub Razavi, UN Women (New York); Emna Aoudi and Samia Letaief, Union G&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;rale des Travailleurs Tunisiens (UGTT, Tunis) and AFTURD; Rab&amp;eacute;a Naciri, Association D&amp;eacute;mocratique des Femmes du Maroc (ADFM, Rabat); Irina Kravchenko (Advisor to Managing Director, Southern and Eastern Mediterranean Region, EBRD, London); Heba Handoussa (ENID, Alneda'a, Egypt); and Nisha Srivastava (SAHYOG and AALI, India). 
Network institutional ties will include: UN Women; The International Association for Feminist Economics; The Economic Research Forum for the Arab Countries, Iran, and Turkey (ERF); Union G&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;rale des Travailleurs Tunisiens (UGTT); AFTURD - Association des femmes Tunisiennes pour la recherche et le d&amp;eacute;veloppement; Association D&amp;eacute;mocratique des Femmes du Maroc (ADFM, Rabat); Association for Advocacy and Legal Initiatives (AALow); Southern and Eastern Mediterranean Region, EBRD, London; and Egypt Network for Integrated Development (ENID, Alneda'a), Egypt. 
The women's rights organizations or women's empowerment NGOs engage in research, advocacy and policy dialogues as well as providing services to their members and beneficiaries. Their participation will help shape the network's agenda as well as build capacity for work in their own countries around issues of women, work, inequalities and public policies. 
It should be noted that NGO participants from North Africa are francophone and thus will require English-French interpretation and translation. For example, given the size and influence of the UGTT (which during a difficult period in 2013 led Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet, which was then awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize), it is important that their representatives be able to benefit from the brainstorming, interactive learning and networking opportunities afforded by the workshops for their own advocacy and research purposes. 
Academic participants and NGOs often have contacts with the statistical offices of their own countries, and UN Women in particular will be able to take part in the discussion of data gaps across the three regions and identification of ways to fill these gaps. Additional channels of impact will be through the academic researchers in the network, each of whom takes part in professional associations and has various links to civil society organizations and policy making bodies. 
We expect our workshops, working groups and conference reports to result in participants' co-production of research agendas with various users across our three regions. This effort should help inform policy and practice and ultimately bring about changes in employment policies, social policies and workplace conditions that can enhance female labour force participation and contribute to the development of each country.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>114221</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P006604/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA017EDD-C008-4338-ABE2-A7D9EEA68E82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A2961412-FA64-4331-A882-DA219AC99567</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social policy and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F354373F-6BF5-4763-845E-4A4681AE3A8F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
