For instance, the outer layer of our skin is an epithelium, as are the linings of our gut and lungs. Epithelia function as barriers that protect our bodies against infective agents, toxic substances and fluid loss, therefore it is essential that if damaged, epithelia are rapidly repaired. Repair of epithelia, for instance during healing of a wound or recovery from surgery, can take several weeks, during which time the wounded individual is at increased risk of infection. In some circumstances epithelial repair fails completely, leaving the individual at constant risk of infection. Therefore the development of therapies to accelerate or improve epithelial repair would be of great benefit to human health. In order to develop such therapies, it is necessary to understand how epithelial repair occurs at the molecular and cellular level. Previous research has shown that there are two methods by which epithelial wound repair can occur. In the first method, cells at the wound edge extent protrusions into the wound. Using these protrusions, the cells grab hold of fibres within the wound and gradually pull themselves forward across the wound. In the second method of epithelial repair, the cells at the edge of wound construct a contractile cable around the wound edge. This cable then constricts like a purse-string and pulls the wound closed. The protrusions required for the first method of closure, and the cable required for the second, are both assembled from a protein called actin. Therefore in either case, a possible way of accelerating epithelial wound healing would be to develop a drug that altered the assembly of actin by wound edge cells, for instance causing them to make more protrusions or a thicker cable. To do this we need to understand how actin assembly is controlled in wound edge cells, as this would reveal ways in which actin assembly could be manipulated using drugs. The mechanisms controlling actin assembly will differ between cells forming protrusions and cables, so we would need to understand how actin is controlled in both situations. It is probable that we would need different drugs to accelerate protrusion-based and cable-based wound closure, therefore we need to be able to identify which type of closure is occurring if we are to select the appropriate method of treatment for a particular wound. We currently do not understand why some wounds heal using protrusions while others heal using a purse-string. The aims of this project are to identify what determines whether a wound heals using protrusions or a cable, and to establish how control of actin assembly differs between cells forming cables and protrusions. Our experiments will be performed using embryos of the fruit fly Drosophila. The advantage of using Drosophila for this research is that we can easily observe epithelial wound healing occurring in live embryos and we can use genetic techniques to determine which genes are important in the two forms of epithelial wound healing. We will study wound healing in two different epithelial tissues in the embryo, one of which forms an actin cable at wound edges, while the other forms protrusions. We will compare wound healing in these two tissues, and investigate why actin assembly at wound edges differs between them. We will use genetic techniques to identify the molecules that control actin assembly in wound edge cells in these two tissues. Our findings will greatly improve our understanding of how epithelia heal and will therefore assist in the development of therapies to accelerate epithelial wound healing. Spreading of cancer cells around the body involves changes in actin assembly by epithelial cells, therefore this work could also aid the development of therapies to treat cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>An epithelium is a sheet of cells that functions as a barrier separating a tissue or organism from its surroundings. Epithelia provide essential protection against infection, toxins and fluid loss, therefore it is vital that wounded epithelia are rapidly repaired. Epithelial repair can be achieved by two mechanisms: 1. A crawling mechanism, in which wound edge cells migrate across the substratum by extension of actin protrusions into the wound. 2. A purse-string mechanism in which a contractile actin cable forms in wound edge cells, constriction of which pulls the wound closed. The method of closure is therefore determined by the mode of actin assembly at the wound edge. The development of therapies to accelerate epithelial repair would greatly benefit human health, and manipulation of signaling pathways controlling actin assembly in wound edge cells is a strategy by which this could be achieved. However, actin signaling will differ between wound edge cells assembling protrusions and cables, therefore if we are to exploit this therapeutic approach, we need to understand under what circumstances each of the two modes of closure is used, and how actin signaling differs between them. This grant will therefore address 2 questions: 1. What determines the mode of actin assembly adopted by wound edge cells? 2. How does signaling differ in wound edge cells exhibiting different modes of actin assembly? We will employ a novel experimental strategy in which we will use genetics and imaging to scrutinise wound healing in two epithelial tissues in the Drosophila embryo; the epidermis and the amnioserosa. These two tissues exhibit different modes of actin assembly at wound edges and this project will involve comparative analysis and manipulation of wound healing in these two tissues. We will determine the influence of tension, adhesion and gene expression on actin assembly at the wound edge, and investigate the roles of Rho GTPases and PI 3-kinase in regulating actin dynamics.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH. Epithelia provide essential protection against infective agents, toxins and fluid loss, therefore it is vital that damaged epithelia are repaired as rapidly as possible. The development of therapies to improve or accelerate epithelial repair would therefore greatly benefit human health. This project will explore how epithelial repair is regulated and how the characteristics of the wound environment affect the mechanism of repair. Our findings will assist the development of therapies to improve epithelial healing in two ways: 1. they will elucidate the signalling mechanisms that regulate epithelial wound healing, which will help in the identification of drug targets. 2. They will increase our understanding of the factors that influence the mechanism of repair, which will help in predicting the appropriate treatment for a particular tissue or wound. Our findings may also impact on human health by increasing our understanding of tumour metastasis and developmental processes such as neural tube closure, which also involve motility of epithelial cells and are likely to involve similar signalling pathways to epithelial wound healing. Our experiments will be performed in Drosophila embryos, and will make use of powerful genetic and imaging techniques not possible in higher organisms, which allow us to explore the cellular, molecular and mechanical mechanisms that underlie epithelial repair. An additional benefit of studying tissue repair in Drosophila is that it is consistent with the 3R's. An important next step towards realising the potential impact of our research is to test whether our findings are relevant in more complex animals and ultimately in patients. Being based in The Healing Foundation Centre we are well placed to do this, as we work alongside a number of groups studying tissue repair in vertebrate systems (E. Amaya, K. Mace, M. Hardman). We meet weekly, providing an excellent forum for discussion and collaboration. We also have regular meetings with clinicians (including G. McGrowther, J. Temple) in which we discuss the clinical applications of our research. During the course of this project we will maintain a constant discourse with our scientific and clinical colleagues, and with their assistance, explore all options for moving the findings of this research project towards clinical application. As well as being an excellent system for studying the cell biology of epithelial repair, the Drosophila embryo is also a potentially useful system for testing drugs and exploring their pharmacology. We can readily treat embryos with drugs and analyse the effect on epithelial healing. As we can image epithelial repair live and at high resolution, we can derive detailed information about the effect of a drug. The genetically tractability of Drosophila makes it useful for exploring the drug pharmacology. We have contacts within the biotech company Renovo and we will discuss with them the possibility of use our system in this way. 2. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. Tissue repair is a subject of great interest to the public, making this research ideal for public engagement. Our research generates striking images and our time-lapse movies bring complicated biological processes to life for lay audiences. Our research is thus ideal for promoting cutting edge science to the public and we are active contributors to such activities. For instance, TM has presented his work in a public lecture at the Birmingham museum ThinkTank, and regularly provides school pupils with the opportunity to visit his lab. These public engagement activities will be continued and expanded during the project. The Faculty has a dedicated media advisor who has been very successful in disseminating our research to the national and international media. The University also houses a popular museum (The Manchester Museum), which provides a direct and permanent link between our research activities and the local public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>360892</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Museum exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>98832BCA-84B7-4911-977E-15BEB23B9CAF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Engaged children in scientific study of skin function and wound healing

These mechanisms open up potential new therapeutic routes for improving the ability of our bodies to repair damage. Further experise and resources will be required to realise the potential medical impacts of these discoveries, so we have taken measures to publicize our findings as widely as possible to clinicians and other academics working in the fields of wound healing and tissue repair. For example, we have presented our findings at the annual meeting of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) as well as the EMBO meeting on wound healing and regeneration. We are currently seeking collaborations and funding to realise the medical potential of our findings. We have also used our research to engage the public about the importance and potential of tissue repair research, for example through presentations and activities at Manchester Museum. Our research generates striking images and movies that have been ideal for engaging public and also for demonstrating how non-vertebrate model organisms can be used to address medically significant research questions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>195E063D-41D6-4806-B595-3E4972BD22DC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The objective of this research was to understand the process by which wounded tissues repair themselves at the molecular level. Our main model system was the Drosophila embryo, allowing wound healing to be studied in vivo in a genetically tractable organism. The main findings of our research concern the events that occur immediately after a tissue has been wounded and process whereby the process of wound healing is activated. These early wound healing 'trigger' events are medically important as if they could be therapeutically manipulated, we could potentially accelerate wound healing or activate healing in situations where it fails completely, such as chronic wounds.

Our first key finding is that the adherens junctions that link cells together within wounded tissue have to undergo substantial changes before wound closure can commence. These changes are necessary for the cells bordering the wound to form a motile front edge that allows them to move across the wound and occur by the process of endocytic recycling.

Our next major finding was the identity of one of the key signals that triggers wound-edge cells to become motile. We found that a lipid called PIP3 strongly accumulates at wound edges and triggers wound-edge cells to form protrusions, which the cells use to move across the wound. By manipulating levels of PIP3, we were able to show that its formation was important for wound closure. We also investigated the process by which the formation of PIP3 is triggered following wounding. We found that the changes in the structure of cell junctions discussed above directly lead to PIP3 formation.

The movement of cells during wound healing is primarily driven the actin cytoskeleton. The final major element of this project was an investigation of how the wound healing triggering signals we had identified led to the activation of actin assembly to drive cell movements. We identified a number of proteins that control actin during wound healing. Each of these proteins has a different role in assembling the actin structures (such as cell protrusions) needed for movement, so co-ordination of all of their activities is required for wound closure.

Overall, our research yielded important new information about the molecular events of wound healing. Our identification of a number of new processes and proteins that are important for wound closure will help the development of new wound healing treatments by revealing a set of new therapeutic targets. In addition, while conducting this research, we developed new techniques for studying wound healing in Drosophila, which will greatly aid future research by ourselves and others in the scientific community.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research has the potential to impact on the development of new treatments to improve wound healing. Our research was largely conducted in Drosophila, so the next step towards realizing this potential is to test whether the mechanisms we have identified are conserved in more complex organisms, and ultimately humans. To do this, we are working closely with colleagues in the faculty. Research conducted by the group of Enrique Amaya has already validated some of our findings in Xenopus. We are now working with Mat Hardman to move this work to mice. Notably, Mat Hardman has links with clinicians and biotech companies, providing potential routes to the clinic. We have used a yearly exhibition at Manchester Museum called 'The Body Experience' to engage the public with our research and the field of wound healing in general. In addition, through the Manchester Drosophila facility, we have been involved in outreach activities aimed at explaining the uses of Drosophila in medical research and have a review article in press, explaining how Drosophila can be used in the study of wound healing.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E04E8E02-A5FB-4779-A08F-681245E756A4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Although the study of wound healing in Drosophila embryos is not new, in this project we substantially refined the technique, including the use of simultaneous time-lapse imaging of multiple embryos and development of new fluorescent probes for studying wound healing.</gtr:description><gtr:id>727FB9C2-62E8-4E2A-81D6-51FBBDA155F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Allows improved sensitivity for the detection of changes in wound healing characteristics.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Drosophila embryo wound healing</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms -
