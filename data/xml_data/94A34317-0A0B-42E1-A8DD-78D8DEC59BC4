The project will provide a comprehensive and detailed analysis of which socio-cultural attributes may facilitate or inhibit ethnic minority entrepreneurship in the process of firm growth and survival in different industries. It will provide recommendations to ethnic minority firms on how to gain a competitive edge and sustain it during both the start-up and break-out stages of business development. This project will also promote knowledge and expertise and bring the community representatives and the ethnic minority entrepreneurs together to deepen ethnic minority entrepreneurs? knowledge and expertise in business development. In addition, the findings may be adopted by the government to effectively target and support firms with growth potential as well as develop training programmes according to the needs of ethnic minority firms.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81584</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings of the study have been disseminated at an academic conference and a practitioner/policy conference organised and hosted by Mr Andy Love, Edmington MP, Chair of All Party Parliamentary Small Business Group (APPSBG). A report summarising the key findings of the study has been given to Mr Andy Love, Association of Community Based Business Advice (ACBBA), Federation of Small Business, Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce and North London Business. The findings of the study have also been disseminated through ethnic (Turkish and Chinese) media and Engage Magazine in the form of short bulletins and articles and through the websites of ACBBA's, Oxford Brookes, Royal Holloway, University of London, and London School of Economics and Political Science. 'Ethnic accountants' have also been influential to 'pass the message across' to business owners.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>72E083E9-BEF6-4823-98FF-E344AE5C7BEF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project also provided insights into the ethnicity dimension of entrepreneurial orientation. Family and co-ethnic advice and labour did not have a significant impact on firms' entrepreneurial orientation. Instead, both access to co-ethnic products and access to co-ethnic suppliers of utilities and facilities had a significant impact on firms' entrepreneurial orientation. The impact of entrepreneurial orientation on firm performance was more debatable, as entrepreneurial orientation had a positive impact on employment growth, but the effects on sales growth and the growth of the number of business premises were both insignificant. Additionally, the findings revealed significant differences between Chinese and Turkish ethnic small firms; the former was more entrepreneurial and more likely to pursue business expansion through acquiring business premises.

There were also significant differences between the two groups of entrepreneurs in terms of business outlook and attitudes towards change. An inward looking tendency was more apparent among Turkish businesses. Compared to Chinese business people, Turkish entrepreneurs were less inclined to seek advice from any source, whether within their community or from other sources of advice and support. A smaller number of Chinese entrepreneurs saw the lack of marketing and market information as constraints on growth. On a similar vein, diversifying into new products or markets seemed more popular, as a growth option, among Chinese than Turkish entrepreneurs. 

The project identified competition (co-ethnic and mainstream) and shortage of skilled labour force as the main constraints on business growth. Added to these were the high business rates and the extent of bureaucracy and regulations imposed by the councils. The study put forward a number of recommendations to business owners and policy makers. Business owners are recommended to assess how their inherent socio-cultural characteristics (i.e. English language and education) contribute to, or hinder, their entrepreneurial endeavours. Such an assessment could help them to diagnose their learning and training needs and attend relevant courses offered by business support units and community centres. The Councils should try to find ways to reduce the extent of bureaucracy, and respond more to small business owners' needs. In addition, the enterprise policies and programmes need to be adapted to the needs of different community groups, as the research shows that 'one size fits all' approach is unlikely to succeed and the take-up of public funded support services will remain poor.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This study was conducted with particular reference to Turkish and Chinese small firms in London, operating in a variety of sectors including manufacturing, retailing, and catering. Different stakeholder groups, including the Association of Community Based Advisors have taken the findings of the project on board and started to develop more effective training programmes for ethnic small businesses.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9A51CC31-56AF-4C3B-9F14-B7F505C7855C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A213F959-2FC0-4188-AD70-B85899F8D8DD"><gtr:id>A213F959-2FC0-4188-AD70-B85899F8D8DD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Facilitating and maintaining research access into ethnic minority firms</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e33763731fe2fbb08a0da4968606d93d"><gtr:id>e33763731fe2fbb08a0da4968606d93d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Altinay, L.
