However, while marketing, clinical and practitioner literature on online networking and health is proliferating, social science has only just begun to address these issues. Given the recognised importance of social networks in health and wellbeing, the current rise in popularity of online networking affords a timely opportunity to learn more about their role in self-care associated with long-term conditions. Focusing on diabetes as one of the most pressing healthcare priorities, and Facebook as currently the most popular social networking site, this project will examine political and professional expectations surrounding the use of social networking sites in chronic illness management, and compare them with actual patterns of online experience. Bringing expertise from our previous research on public perceptions of health risks, and the use of new interactive media, we aim to provide access to the contextual factors that shape knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to social networking sites and diabetes, and pinpoint potential 'gaps in understanding' which may lead to gaps in envisioning solutions in policy and practice.

We adopt an interdisciplinary approach that combines linguistic and sociological frameworks, asking what online networking does and means for people with diabetes. The Facebook site allows its users to create textual and visual content, connections, organisational and individual pages, and groups, and in this way facilitates creation and maintenance of different network types (e.g. between relatives, partners, friends as well as wider circles). Our contextual study of Facebook use by people with diabetes will therefore help us understand the role of these different networks, and of the Internet, in shaping and supporting self-care practices outside formal healthcare organizations.

Practitioners in both the diabetes education sector and broader health care sectors will be able to gain insights into how people with diabetes understand and use various networking and content-creating Facebook features in the everyday, how they evaluate their experiences, and what bearing it has on their lives and coping. The results will inform development of policy and practice initiatives aimed at provision of support for long-term conditions in the Web 2.0 age.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Findings of this project will be of value to a variety of academic, practitioner and service user groups. With the increasing recognition of the importance of social media among policy makers and managers in the UK and Europe (see, for example, RVZ (2010)*, and the 'High Quality Care for All' review (2008), the proposed research will impact on the decision making of government, industry and the third sectors with an interest in computer mediated health communication. Specifically, this project will deliver insights regarding professional and lay user perspectives on social networking technologies in the context of chronic illness management, and offers methodologies which will be of great use in future analysis and evaluation of the burgeoning discourses around Health 2.0. 

How would they benefit from the research?
Schein et al (2010) have recently expressed concern that public health agencies still lag when it comes to adopting social media platforms, pointing to the evidence that 'health information-seeking is migrating to social media sites like Facebook and YouTube, and there are an increasing number of health-related searches taking place on these platforms' (p. 13). At the same time, those UK organisations that already use social networking sites tend to view them as yet another channel through which they can deliver messages to audiences, a tendency that made Craig Lefebvre lament that social media is not just a new way to 'reach' people; rather 'the people we wish to engage with around specific issues need to be understood in the context of how they construct their social media space, not by how we construct it for ourselves' (2011). Only on the basis of a deeper understanding of social media communication about diabetes as being grounded in social, bodily, and cultural experiences of participants, can one then go on to devise diabetes education and social support activities in the online networking domain.
 
The project addresses these issues on several levels. In particular, the project will:

1. critically examine political and professional expectations surrounding the use of SNSs in relation to chronic illness and compare them with actual patterns of use and experience in order to pinpoint potential 'gaps in understanding' , which may lead to gaps in envisioning policy solutions.
2. empirically examine contextualised meanings of 'social support' in the online social networking environment for people with diabetes; this can inform development of diabetes support initiatives targeted to specific situational needs. We will explore how interaction in SNSs is used by people with diabetes in the everyday; how online activities that go beyond simple health information searches are integrated in their lives; and how social support is made meaningful (or not) through such practices and activities. Following Williams at el (2004) we argue that such qualitative study should be the first step towards quantitative assessment of support interventions in the SNS context.
3. establish online resources used, preferred and trusted by people with diabetes and plot the position of NHS sources in this context.
4. establish participants' preferred modes and ways of interaction which can inform patient-professional communication. 

In general, the project will:
1. have a direct impact on the future health and well-being of the nation; as diabetes represents a serious clinical and financial challenge to the UK's health system it is important to understand how new technologies such as social networking tools impact society;
2. have a direct impact on understanding of social media uses and functionality in health communication; we propose a case study of diabetes as a starting point in a field that, it is hoped, will expand to include other conditions in future critical and contextual analyses of SNSs and health.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Diabetes UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>collaboration with the research charity Diabetes UK</gtr:description><gtr:id>73C92E9A-E3A7-4C21-90DC-CF7665859C6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>recruitment of project participants and dissemination activities</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>assistance with the recruitment of interview participants</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>analysis of discourse on the organizational pages on Facebook; dissemination and discussion of research findings</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>poster presentation 'Gratefuloldtimer: constructing life with diabetes through Facebook status updates' at Medicine X conference, Stanford University, US</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7CF433E-B823-4B11-86C2-62E3063D2929</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Led to an interesting discussion of methods for Internet-based research

The workshop included a session of talks by individuals with diabetes which shared their lived experiences and ideas, a presentation by a digital communications manager from the research charity Diabetes UK, as well as presentations by the team members about the results of the research. The workshop led to a productive and intensive exchange of ideas and practices between different stakeholder groups, such as, e.g. diabetes educators (professionals behind such national programs as DESMOND), people with diabetes, patient representatives, digital managers, and researchers in the areas of linguistics, media studies, and medical sociology. The project participants reported impact in the following areas, as evident from the feedback questionnaires returned after the event:
? improving understanding of the social media use in relation to chronic illness management by different stakeholders (government, third sector, and 'lay' users);
? improving understanding of the insights that language-focused frameworks can deliver in the study of social media;
? exposure to professional and academic topics that would not have been available elsewhere (participants commented on the importance of promoting the discussion of research findings between academics and practitioner and lay audiences, such as people with diabetes).

The overall feedback for the event was extremely positive, including reports of new knowledge and plans to discuss the project results with NHS practitioners and digital managers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>49923EE1-573A-4F8F-9CE1-29E2A27213D4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overall aim of this project was to investigate systematically expert and lay perspectives on online networking and diabetes in the UK through the analysis of discourses and practices surrounding the use of Facebook. In order to achieve this aim, we have successfully: examined professional and policy discourses on the use of social networking sites/SNSs by people with chronic illness in research articles, policy documents, as well as diabetes-related Facebook pages; analysed the content of profiles and groups created by people with diabetes on Facebook; carried out interviews with adults with diabetes and examined their ideas and experiences about using Facebook; investigated, compared and evaluated expectations and practices of these different stakeholders.

The study has revealed important differences between lay and professional expectations and uses of social media by individuals with chronic illness in the everyday. We found that clinical and policy articles described SNSs as another source of 'patient empowerment', reviving a range of celebratory claims about the Internet and health while marginalising the factors that influence users' online and offline practices and contexts. At the same time, as we report in in our BMJ blogs article, policy documents have largely overlooked social media's potential to support therapeutic interactions between healthcare providers and service users. 
By contrast, our observation of Facebook-based activities followed by interviews with people with diabetes demonstrate that online social networking is a locus of different concurrent practices: not only empowering, but also both resistant and compliant. 
Our participants sought and provided mutual support through building or maintaining social networks, reporting on everyday stories of success and failure to manage blood sugar levels, and disseminating information about diabetes management to others. The Newsfeed function provided a useful constant drip of diabetes content (through subscription to relevant pages or groups) integrating the condition into a central pillar of users' online activities.
People with diabetes also used Facebook's technological features such as status updates to construct their identities. The use of humour in reference to diabetes, both through linguistic strategies and picture and video upload, was employed to negotiate expectations of strict compliance with medical guidelines and redefine the social meanings of physical and mental changes associated with diabetes. 
At the same time, however, the fact that there are multiple diverse audiences for one's post as well as specific social norms associated with SNSs (where affability is rewarded) created limits to disclosure, as participants chose to share mostly motivational and humorous content and/or post the content they perceived to be 'unproblematic'. While this positive outlook was instrumental in helping some people with diabetes cope, for those who wanted to convey other emotions or engage in critical discussions, such stance functioned as an exclusionary mechanism.
In line with previous ethnographic research on the Internet and health, this project emphasises the importance of studying 'Health 2.0' as embedded in the practices of everyday life as well as in the pre-existing social, economic and political structures. While the SNSs enable the sharing of important condition-specific information and provision of social support in multiple and unique ways, the imperative to express solidarity and emotional closeness plays into the commercially-driven objective of the online networking platforms that harvest data from targeted user bases. The corporate ownership of such platforms and wider neoliberal politics of health may present significant constraints to achieving the ideal of 'patient empowerment' in these online spaces.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our study of the Facebook use by the NHS, commercial, and third sector organisations as well as by people with diabetes contributes to the understanding of the role of SNSs, and of the Internet in general, in shaping and supporting self-care practices outside formal healthcare organizations. By illuminating the factors that influence online and offline practices and contexts of people with diabetes the project can inform the SNSs-based professional interventions. Methodologically, the project developed a framework for a critical and contextual study of online networking and health which can be used for further studies of social media discourses on diabetes and other conditions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E0546CF5-F7CD-4445-80F1-62A7B1960DC0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/23B9F692-ACF2-4C71-A194-85D67DC382AE"><gtr:id>23B9F692-ACF2-4C71-A194-85D67DC382AE</gtr:id><gtr:title>The many faces of diabetes: A critical multimodal analysis of&amp;nbsp;diabetes pages on Facebook</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Language &amp; Communication</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4a69267bd65c1e8cd5396e13dced8923"><gtr:id>4a69267bd65c1e8cd5396e13dced8923</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hunt D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E062FE1F-40C8-43A3-AD17-8D9DEC1A23A3"><gtr:id>E062FE1F-40C8-43A3-AD17-8D9DEC1A23A3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Expectations in the field of the internet and health: an analysis of claims about social networking sites in clinical literature.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociology of health &amp; illness</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4bb5d3d3872ab0a40ce86afe29ac49bb"><gtr:id>4bb5d3d3872ab0a40ce86afe29ac49bb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Koteyko N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0141-9889</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3241DAA9-CDDA-49DF-AD49-5104EB6A62BC"><gtr:id>3241DAA9-CDDA-49DF-AD49-5104EB6A62BC</gtr:id><gtr:title>'What was your blood sugar reading this morning?'
