However, many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have enormous difficulty learning words and approximately 30% have virtually no language at 9 years of age. As ASD affects 1 in 68 children worldwide, investigating why so many of these children struggle to learn words is a global research priority and a necessary precursor to designing effective interventions.

This project will explore multiple stages of word learning in minimally-verbal children with ASD in order to isolate the source, or sources, of their difficulties. In a series of experiments involving children with ASD and children with typical development, we will compare how these groups (a) identify the meanings of unfamiliar words, (b) retain the meanings of words over time, and (c) generalise words to novel contexts. We will also assess how these stages of word learning are influenced by autistic children's reduced sensitivity to informative social cues, such as gaze and gesture. Based on these novel data, we will develop a new integrative account of word learning deficits in ASD that incorporates multiple aspects of word learning and how they are influenced by social difficulties. This account will be supported by a new computational model simulating a child with ASD learning new words. The model will indicate how the stages of word learning might interact to produce the problems observed in children with ASD. Consequently, this modelling will provide insight that could not be obtained by simply observing behaviour. Moreover, it will yield numerous theoretical hypotheses for future research and provide a basis for predicting the effects of new interventions that may promote word learning in children with ASD. 

The findings from this research will have important implications for practice in Special Education. By examining multiple aspects of word learning, our studies will identify specific weaknesses that can be targeted by interventions and strengths to capitalise on. We will also discover whether word learning in children with ASD can be improved by directing their attention and identify the best way of doing this (e.g. social or non-social cues). Crucially, this project will provide a necessary foundation on which to develop new evidence-based interventions that scaffold each stage of word learning, thus providing optimal learning conditions for children with ASD.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children (Wingate et al., 2014) and 30% of this population have virtually no functional language at 9 years of age (Anderson et al., 2007). To advance understanding of language development in ASD and inform the design of increasingly effective interventions, this project addresses the fundamental question of why children with ASD have difficulty learning words. The proposed studies will reconceptualise scientific knowledge by applying an emerging theoretical account of neurotypical word learning and its associated methodologies to minimally-verbal children with ASD.

The reach of this project covers academia, the non-academic ASD community, and the general public. Key stakeholders include researchers in various psychological fields, special education teachers, speech and language therapists, autism charities (e.g. the National Autistic Society, World Autism Organisation), support organisations (e.g., the Council for Disabled Children, the SEND Gateway Network), and parents of children with ASD. Through a range of knowledge exchange pathways I will strengthen my links to stakeholders and their networks, supporting the development of my research in the years to come. 

How will they benefit from this research?
Academia
This project will identify whether children with ASD show impairments in core word learning mechanisms. We will identify the location, and nature, of their difficulties by examining multiple aspects of word learning (referent selection, cross situational mapping, retention and generalisation), and assessing how they are impacted by reduced sensitivity to social cues. Building on original empirical data, we will develop a new multi-stage theory of word learning in ASD that synthesises dynamic associative and social-cognitive processes. Its explanatory power will be demonstrated through computational modelling. 

This project represents an innovative and timely new approach to investigating word learning in ASD that draws the field in line with recent advances in the neurotypical literature. Our multidisciplinary approach will progress understanding of how word learning processes interact with each other and environmental influences. The resulting theoretical advances will provide a foundation for my future research programme which will include behavioural experiments, computational work, and intervention studies.

This project will also foster a new international partnership between Psychology Departments at Lancaster University and the University of Iowa that will draw together experts in typical and atypical language development. 

Wider Society
Promoting vocabulary development in children with ASD is a core objective in educational and clinical contexts. This research will spotlight specific weaknesses in autistic word learning that can be targeted by interventions, and strengths to capitalise on. It will also identify what kinds of attentional cues facilitate word learning in children with ASD, thus identifying means of promoting lexical development. 

Practitioners will benefit from greater understanding of the holistic word learning process afforded by the multi-stage experiments and computational modelling. The findings will also provide a vital theoretical foundation for new interventions that provide optimal learning conditions for children with ASD. Thus, this research will have long-term impact by informing the development of new evidence-based methods for fostering vocabulary development in minimally-verbal children with ASD.

This project will establish stronger connections with non-academic stakeholders, fostering co-production of knowledge and increasing likelihood of impact in the short-, medium- and long-term. It will also inform the general public's understanding of science by providing an insight into how experimental and computational methods can reveal how children with ASD learn words.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151571</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N016955/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>544E9837-9640-4AAB-93EB-416962206DD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education and School</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1AC33C6-9927-41AC-B23B-2EED8F593588</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Experimental Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
