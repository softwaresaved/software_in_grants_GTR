The work is divided into four substantive Work Packages (WPs). 

The first Work Package is concerned with how longer working lives are associated with the changing labour markets that older workers face, and with older populations' general well-being. The second investigates the need for working longer in the nexus of the workplace, highlighting the role of work-life balance, and potential inequalities in skills and working conditions, and inter-generational exchanges. The third Work Package explores fundamental inequalities in (healthy) life expectancy. 

In the final Work Package the findings from the other three Work Packages are brought together in order to propose policy scenarios which have the potential both to facilitate longer working lives and to positively contribute to intra- and inter-generational equity. Specific policy recommendations will be made based on varying evidence from different contexts of EU Member States.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In order to maximise impact, interaction with key stakeholders is built in a continuous process which is fundamental to each work package. It is reflected specifically for example in a systematic review of stakeholders' response to existing knowledge on socio-economic ageing inequalities (Work Package 2). FACTAGE also foresees a discourse on assumptions on equitable social protection (Work Package 4) and innovative policy approaches (Work Package 5). A specific dissemination work package (Work Package 6) is designed to ensure that FACTAGE stimulates further research activities and engages stakeholders. The research seeks to develop innovative policy responses to inequalities in ageing in Europe, which will be beneficial to policymakers throughout the EU.

A website which will also act as a resource base for sources on the theme of 'fairer active ageing for Europe' will be set up from the very start of the project. This will seek to raise awareness of current and prospective inequalities and required action will need to be created at three different levels:

1. Academic research community: papers and reports will be disseminated through existing research networks, conference presentations, and organisation of special workshops though the course of the project.

2. National policy makers: consortium partners will identify and connect with the policymaking communities in their respective countries and relevant to specific topics in each work package (through e.g. specialised workshops). A major policy conference will also target specifically national policy makers and officials from a range of EU Member States.

3. European policy level: Several consortium members are involved in activities with the European Commission on a regular basis. The Centre for European Policy Studies (based in Brussels) will host a series of workshops/meetings around the FACTAGE activities inviting not just academic scholars outside the consortium but also other stakeholders at the European level.

All consortium members are high level academics in their own capacity, with extensive experience in drafting and presenting policy reports for a wide range of stakeholders. The diversity of partners makes the consortium ideally placed to address all three levels. It ensures channels of continuous outreach to and feedback from stakeholders. For example:

1. Statistics Austria has a direct line to National Statistical Institutes and Eurostat via existing networks. This ensures that discussions on data issues reach those able to address this. At the same time methodological research in WP4 is communicated directly to peers in the statistical community.

2. NIESR has a long running tradition of conducting and disseminating policy relevant research and a wide network of other researchers.

3. CEPS has excellent communication lines to the European Commission and other pan-European Stakeholders based in Brussels. CEPS is also managing the European Network of Economic Policy Research Institutes (ENEPRI) network of leading European policy research institutes.

4. Individual FACTAGE researchers are involved in projects on ageing research financed by national and international bodies.

Attendees included other academics and researchers working on related issues, as well as policymakers. The purpose was to disseminate and share findings from recent research on this topic, and also to help inform future debates and areas for further investigation. The event prompted useful discussion about both the research and the subject area more broadly.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.ceps.eu/events/productivity-ageing-societies-%E2%80%93-what-impact-economy</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P002692/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8785A44-DFE5-4A95-99D0-1A49582F1688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
