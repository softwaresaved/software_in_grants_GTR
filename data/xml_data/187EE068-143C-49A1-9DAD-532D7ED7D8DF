of the Paralympics</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/P003842/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>With research on the commercial mediation of para-sport bodies being described as being in its infancy, there are urgent calls for more joined-up evidence based research that can address the cultural legacy of Paralympic sport (the implications of media constructions of disability), people with disabilities and the role they play in cultural life. This project will provide this data-and thus insights and policy recommendations by completing the first funded academic study on the impact of para-sport representations on public attitudes towards para-sport bodies. 

Under increased commercial pressure to construct media coverage focused on 'palatable and aesthetically pleasing' forms of disability, para-sport representations often reinforce medical, individual and stereotypical understandings of disability. Athletes with disabilities are often presented with a 'super' prefix ('superhuman', 'supercrip'), that can reinforce established hierarchies of disability. Indeed, the think tank DEMOS revealed 99% of those with disabilities remained untouched by the London 2012 Paralympic Games.

Building on our previous scholarship, this project addresses: a) the meanings ascribed to para-sport bodies through the mediation of the 2016 Paralympics b) audience interpretations of these representations, and c) through creative artworks, how meanings ascribed to para-sport bodies influence public understandings of people with disabilities, inclusion/exclusion, and the full participation of people with disabilities in everyday life.

To fully address para-sport representations, marginality, and, empowerment requires ensuring people with disabilities are integral to the entire project journey. The design and focus of the project has been collaboratively formed and incorporated input from academics with disabilities, former President of the Canadian Paralympic Committee, the Chair of the All-party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Disability (Dr Lisa Cameron, MP), an artists with disabilities (Liz Crow), and investigators with extensive expertise on the Paralympics, mediation, the body, art, and documentary. 

The project operationalises a series of integrated qualitative work packets that will produce robust, co-created, data on the dominant meanings ascribed to para-sport bodies and audience interpretations within the context of everyday life, and creative outputs based on the ways audiences understand such meanings. Methodologically, this involves interviews with production and editorial personal, textual and moving image analysis, audience focus groups and interviews, and creative/public engagement through art/museum exhibits and a project documentary. 

The project is of pressing importance with respect to furthering knowledge, policy and practice with regard to meanings ascribed to disability, inclusion/exclusion, everyday life with disability (including suffering, pain and loneliness), and established relationships between disability and a range of psychological and emotional disorders (e.g. mental health issues, PTSD, eating disorders). The project will make an important contribution to public awareness; its own legacy shaping public attitudes towards disability/people with disabilities through permanent, accessible digital and documentary exhibits (elevating voices of people with disabilities) deriving from creative engagement though the project. The project will impact on a wide-range of end users, including broadcasters (C4), the International Paralympic committee (IPC) (access facilitated by collaborators who sit on relevant IPC committees), the UK government (via the APPG) and the general public through engagement with creative outputs. Potential risks have been mitigated via existing collaborations with C4, the IPC, national Paralympic committees, and support from the APPG for Disability that demonstrate the study is feasible and safe, and by drawing on interdisciplinary expertise across the project team and the advisory board.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
a) Policy Makers &amp;amp; Media: Channel 4 (para-sport broadcaster) and strategic partners (the IPC and BPA) will benefit from guidelines/blueprint for future para-sport events. C4 are in full support of the project and anticipate the research to impact their broadcast practice. Policy makers (e.g. in host cities, IPC education, gender and technology committees) will benefit with respect to enhanced debate over full human rights for people living with disabilities and participation in sport for people with disabilities (e.g. DCMS, Sport England, GBPC). The APPG Disability support the project. 
b) The IPC Archives (Bonn), the Annella Olimpica Museum (Barcelona) and the IPC Museum and Heritage Centre (under development, Bonn): will benefit from digitised creative outputs that are integrated into the project methodology. 
c) General Public: The project impacts upon the societal understandings of attitudes towards disability through engagement with a dialogic web based platform and public exhibitions/art integral to the research, the project documentary (see technical plan) and public feedback about wider attitudes towards Paralympic representations collected through interactive dialogue that are embedded within the planned exhibitions.
e) Civil Society: disabled peoples' groups including campaigners, support groups, charities and artists (such as the Equality &amp;amp; Human Rights Commission, and DEMOS) will benefit through provision of additional evidence-based research furthering knowledge on the representation, meaning and public attitudes about disability. 

How will they benefit from the research?
The research will engage the above beneficiaries through the development of evidence-based frameworks that ensure beneficiaries will:
a) Develop enhanced understanding of public attitudes towards inclusion/exclusion, empowerment/marginality with respect to how para-sport media coverage can reinforce or challenge negative stereotypes, attitudes, beliefs and prejudices, and the impact upon the everyday experiences of disability; thereby influencing media practice;
b) Develop greater comprehension of public attitudes towards constructions of disability, empowerment and marginalisation, and possibilities for social change with regard to the everyday lives of people with disabilities/full participation in social and civic society; thereby contributing towards positive societal change and public understandings of disability;
c) Engage in debate (exhibitions/end seminar event) and receive verbal and written reports that will be delivered to the IPC education and gender equality committees, and the media and communication team (as well as national Paralympic committees, and the IPC VISTA conference) on Paralympic representation/wider cultural legacy; thereby impacting the further development of C4/IPC guidelines with respect to accredited media coverage of future Games and para-sport events and the mandates of specific committees;
d) Receive robust evidence (for key policy makers, think tanks and government bodies, such as DCMS, Disability Rights UK, the APPG, Disability) about the cultural legacy of para-sport events and associated societal impacts; thereby advancing evidence-based debate and influencing policy formation on disability rights and full participation in everyday life. 

This research seeks to advance these benefits through collaborative/interdisciplinary/creative work that can reframe public and academic debates about para-sport representations, that can bridge the theory/practice/policy gap, that ensures elevated disabled voices, and that can provide maximum benefits for the public, policy makers, host cities, and media-practitioners. Further, the on-going, public, accessible and open communication embedded within the research, and integrated project documentary, will ensure the largest possible interdisciplinary and international user community for the research and project outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>557004</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P003842/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C451D81-4626-46D5-BE5B-7B684CED97EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies &amp; Pop Culture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
