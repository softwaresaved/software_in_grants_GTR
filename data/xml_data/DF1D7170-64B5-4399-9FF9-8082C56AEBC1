An overview of the hero's post-classical afterlife is provided in the final chapter of the applicant's monograph 'Herakles' (London 2012), but a fuller understanding requires the input of scholars from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds, with specialisms in the many periods, countries and media concerned. Just such a group of scholars came together for the international conference, 'Hercules: a Hero for All Ages' (Leeds, June 2013), as well as several contemporary writers/artists talking about their Hercules-themed work (for full details, see http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/homepage/400/hercules_conference_2013). 

Following on from the conference, the proposed network will develop a series of four volumes for Brill's series Metaforms: Studies in the Reception of Classical Antiquity. Each volume will treat a particular period and aspect of Herculean reception, taking a selection of papers from the original conference as a starting point, but revising and adding papers via correspondence, a series of meetings between the international team of editors, and a colloquium (Leeds 2017).

1. 'Herakles Inside and Outside the Church: from the first Christian Apologists to the end of the Quattrocento' will consider Herakles-Hercules' adoption inside and outside the early Church as an allegorical figure, effectively mediating between paganism and the new religion, and later Christian appropriations of this figure. 

2. 'The Exemplary Hercules' will focus on the period from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment and beyond, examining the hero as the incarnation of virtue in a wide range of literature and art, and in political as well as moralising contexts.

3. 'Hercules Performed' will explore Hercules' development in works written for performance, encompassing new works as well as re-workings of ancient tragedy and comedy, opera as well as stage plays, and other media such as radio.

4. 'The Modern Hercules' will cover Hercules' appearances in various media from the nineteenth century to the present day, including consideration of contemporary art, children's literature, cartoons, film, video-games, political and commercial discourses.

In addition to these academic publications, the project will develop its website (http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/homepage/401/hercules_project) to include accessible summaries of its research and a variety of open-access resources, such as podcasts and vidcasts of talks highlighting the links between the ancient hero and Hercules in modern popular culture. It is also associated with two activities aimed at public audiences:

i) 'The Labours of Herakles' exhibition: this is based on the work of contemporary New Zealand artist Marian Maguire ((http://www.marianmaguire.com/), which superimposes an ancient Greek image of Herakles onto nineteenth-century New Zealand landscapes, wittily casting the hero as a European Pioneer. Previously exhibited in New Zealand, since January 2015 the series has been on tour in the UK, Germany and Belgium.

ii) A new Hercules-themed oratorio, commissioned by Todmorden Choral Society, West Yorkshire, from local composer Tim Benjamin (http://timbenjamin.com/). This is to be premiered in April 2017 by the amateur choir and members of Todmorden Orchestra, alongside a number of professional soloists and an actor-narrator, with further performances later in the year.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries, several other groups will benefit from this research, either directly or indirectly via the project's associated public engagement activities:

1. Impact of the volumes in Higher Education: 

The four volumes will be marketed as suitable for the increasing number of university courses in the UK, USA and elsewhere on Classical reception and on Classical mythology. Individual papers will also be suitable for undergraduate reading-lists in other disciplines (as detailed under Academic beneficiaries). The measures taken to ensure the volumes' accessibility to researchers from a variety of disciplines will facilitate their use by undergraduate students, for whom they will provide a way into research in disciplines other than their own. The extent of this impact may not be apparent for some time, but the applicant will conduct regular surveys to track usage of the volumes in HE.

2. Impact of the website: 

The website (http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/homepage/401/hercules_project) will present the project in an accessible way, including summaries of its research and materials pitched for a general audience. It will be promoted by means of regular postings to the JISC list 'Hercules: a Hero for All Ages' (https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=HERCULES) and social media, alerting subscribers/followers to news items and the addition of resources. Usage statistics will provide one measure of interest in the project, while a Comments facility will be used to elicit qualitative, discursive feedback from users.

3. Impact of the 'Labours of Herakles' touring exhibition:

While some legs of the tour pre-date the current project, (measurement of) the impact on the venues concerned is ongoing. The exhibition is innovative in its combining of contemporary artworks with antiquities and other artefacts from each host's regular collection. Measures of its impact on the venues concerned will include feedback from both museum professionals and visitors, and the extent to which it influences the institution's future public engagement practice. There has also been impact on the artist herself, in terms of exposure and recognition of her work in Europe, which can to some extent be measured in financial terms.

4. Impact of the oratorio:

The oratorio is both an example of the impact of the applicant's previous work and a conduit for dissemination of the ongoing research of the project:
 
i) On the composer: Stafford's monograph 'Herakles' influenced the composer in his original choice of subject, and the final chapter in particular has been a point of reference in the early stages of development of a work which will use 'found' text to tell the story of the hero across the ages. Later stages of the libretto's development will be informed by the research of the proposed network, mediated by collaboration with the applicant. 

ii) On the performers: the majority of the performers are likely to engage directly with the research only via an introductory session provided by the applicant on the background to the work. However, resources will be made available to any who wish to pursue the research in more detail, and all will be influenced by their experience of participating in the work itself. Corroboration of the impact will be sought from both amateur and professional performers via a questionnaire and via oral testimony. 

iii) On the eventual audiences: the audience at the premiere and later performances will be asked to complete a short questionnaire, including questions designed to elicit answers on how their understanding of classical myth has changed as a result of attending.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24290</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Composer Tim Benjamin was commissioned by Todmorden Choral Society to produce a new work, &amp;quot;Herakles&amp;quot;, which is based on the story of the Choice of Herakles as re-told by Dio Chrysostom in his &amp;quot;Discourse on Kingship&amp;quot;, delivered to the new Roman Emperor Trajan in 98CE. Work on the libretto and choral elements of the score was completed in December 2016, with further work on the orchestration continuing into February 2017 (orchestral rehearsals being scheduled to start in March). This musical drama will be performed by Todmorden Choral Society and Todmorden Orchestra together with a cast of professional soloists at the premiere in Todmorden Town Hall on 30 April 2017. This performance is to be filmed, and the resulting film screened in Leeds on 8 July 2017, as part of the conference &amp;quot;Celebrating Hercules in the Modern World&amp;quot; (the event will be open to the public as well as conference delegates).</gtr:description><gtr:id>8A1B72AA-8C84-49B5-B1D6-0F1316CB3F50</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The work is itself evidence of the impact of the Hercules Project, since it is informed by Emma Stafford's research on both the ancient figure of Herakles and his reception in later cultures. In turn, the work is expected to have impact on both performers and audiences. Preliminary feedback from Choral Society members was elicited on 22nd Feb, but will need collating with further responses to the piece, to be sought from audiences at the premiere in April and at the Leeds presentation in July.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Herakles oratorio</gtr:title><gtr:type>Composition/Score</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://herculesproject.leeds.ac.uk/musical-drama/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Herakles Oratorio - pre-rehearsals talk and preliminary performer feedback</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>03DBDCD5-DC6A-4084-94AF-8C03AC671292</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This activity relates to the Herakles oratorio, which is one of the major activities detailed in the project's Pathways to Impact. The first rehearsal for the choir was on Wednesday 4th January 2017, at which the work was introduced to Todmorden Choral Society through short talks by Emma Stafford and the composer Tim Benjamin. Emma's talk on the origins and previous development of the story of Herakles' Choice was supplemented by an information booklet which is available to download from the Project website. Tim gave an engaging account of his version of the story, highlighting the chorus' role at every point, especially as commentators who reflect on the action as it unfolds. Following on from this, the 80+ members of the Choral Society started work on some highlights from the piece, focusing on the opening and closing sections (based on Emma's translation of the Homeric Hymn to Herakles, which dates from the seventh century BCE) and some of the colourful sections in the middle where the chorus represent the peoples of various collapsed civilisations, past which Herakles travels with Hermes, the messenger god. The reception of the work was overwhelmingly positive. The chorus particularly liked the idea of the story being held together by a narrator, so that everyone is clear about what is going on, and saw the music as &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;challenging&amp;quot; but felt it to be well-written for the capabilities of a Choral Society, so everyone is confident that they can deliver the piece as it is meant to be heard. On Wednesday 22nd February the Project's administrative assistant attended a rehearsal in order to solicit feedback from participants on their experience of the piece so far: a summary of responses will be included with later reports on the impact of the work, and indirectly the research which underpins it, on a variety of audiences.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://herculesproject.leeds.ac.uk/musical-drama/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Establishment of conference programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9B8C193E-315C-4C5F-94AB-56F9A113D44C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In December 2017 a CfP was published for the conference 'Celebrating Hercules in the Modern World', to take place at the University of Leeds 7-9th July 2008. The aim of the conference is to boost progress on the project's four volumes, by bringing together the editorial team and existing contributors, while allowing for the 'trying out' of a range of supplementary papers. By the deadline in late January 2017, over 30 abstracts had been received, most of good enough quality to be considered for inclusion in the conference: acceptance of papers for publication in one of the volumes will be subject to further scrutiny. The draft programme for the conference is now available on the project website, where updates will be posted, and a link to the online booking system will soon be available.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://herculesproject.leeds.ac.uk/conferences/conference-2017/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch of new website and social media accounts</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BCF16EDB-DE37-431D-8FA3-003481C284E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Hercules Project's new website (http://herculesproject.leeds.ac.uk/) was launched in December 2017. It replaced the website originally developed for the 2013 Leeds conference 'Hercules: a Hero for All Ages', which initiated the contacts which have since built up into the current network. The new website is on a different platform, Wordpress rather than jadu, though still with the Leeds University branding -- the change will facilitate the posting of audio- and video-recordings, as well as making still images easier to handle. The new website's existence was advertised alongside the first CfP for the 2017 conference (see separate Engagement entry) via the Hercules mailing list (HERCULES@JISCMAIL.AC.UK), which currently has 147 susbcribers, and more widely via the Classicists list and a number of other lists concerned with classical reception. It is now the 'public face' of the project, the aim being to grow its reach during the course of the project, and to cater for a variety of audiences. For example, academic participants are likely to be interested in the site's Conference area, while participants in the Herakles oratorio (see separate Engagement entry) have already been directed to the website for information and resources associated with the performance. The site also includes an archive section on the touring Exhibition which was the major public-engagement activity of an earlier stage of the project. The project's social media presence now includes a Facebook site 'Hercules 2017' (https://www.facebook.com/groups/437722113284854/) and a Twitter account @Hercules_Leeds (#Hercules2017).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://herculesproject.leeds.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P003664/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>89068F3B-44C7-45D9-92CB-8BE148301439</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Reception</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
