The political/artistic benefits of such collaborations on the one side, and the professional/personal risks and political disadvantages on the other, are equally played out within and outside of the cultural sector. \nOne of the first questions following this enquiry, is whether an artist can be expected to be a representative of their nation in such a collaborative artistic context, and at the same time, can the artists involved ever escape those positions, when political realities indicate otherwise? And how can art facilitate those oscillating dynamics?\nIn 2002 the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, hosted the exhibition Wherever I Am. The exhibition showcased the acclaimed Palestinian and Israeli women artists Emily Jacir and Yael Bartana, and the renowned American photographer Lee Miller (1907-1977). Six years on, such an exhibition would prove very difficult to deliver.\nWith this backdrop, I have embarked on a long term artistic collaboration with the visual artist Larissa Sansour. Sansour's work deals extensively with the occupation of Palestine, and the conditions and destiny of the Palestinian people. \nMy art practice has been preoccupied with notions of identity and subjectivity in general, and Jewishness in particular, all within the creative use of alter egos and fictional characters, mainly in the context of audience active participation. \nIn recent years my research has expanded to include notions of Jewishness within the Arab/Islamic world. I have also been researching my family history, who have resided peacefully for generations as Jews in the Muslim quarter in the old city in Jerusalem. This interest has also manifested in a preoccupation with the political situation in the region. A large body of work entitled Welcome Home included a series of projects that foregrounded the Palestinian Right to Return, within universal notions of human rights, to a homeland. Generally it could be said that my research is looking to find and create positive, if not straightforward or simple, models of Jewish co-existence within Arab/Muslim contexts.\nThe collaboration with Sansour so far has included a graphic novel, the Novel of Nonel and Vovel. \nA series of dialogues with three women curators from the Middle East will form the second part of the book in the form of illustrated texts.\nI am planning a series of three live events to take place at the; Brooklyn Museum, Tate Modern and Nikolaj Contemporary Art Centre. The events will include a video and performance program of our work, as well as conversations between Sansour and myself, chaired by the curators/contributors to the graphic novel. The events are aimed to expand and reconfigure some of the artistic, cultural and political issues arising from such collaborations and the place of art within the framework of political realities in general. After the live events a publicly engaged residency will take place in London hosted by the Live Art Development Agency and Artadmin. The residency will be developed as a durational interactive installation. The residency will bring together Sansour and my own artistic processes. \nIt is anticipated that both the live events and the residency will be used long term as positive models for understanding and mobilising the complexity of artistic collaborations on both sides of state/military occupation. At the end of the project I will complete and publish a paper that reflects my ongoing research and artistic practice in relation to such artistic collaborations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-06-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24462</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H00114X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
