Enclosures.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I033181/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Unwanted fires continue to account for a significant loss of life, damage to property, damage to business and damage to the environment. Meanwhile the cost of prevention and protection measures adds a substantial drain to an already struggling economy. The cost of fire is almost 1% of GDP while the cost of fire safety measures for a new building is around 2.5%. The action required to prevent such losses is expensive and may involve inappropriate or unnecessary measures. To address specific threats, such as fires in public buildings, or resulting from terrorism it is essential to improve our understanding of the behaviour of unwanted fires particularly the transition to under-ventilated flaming and the rapid increase in toxicity. Most fire deaths and most fire injuries actually result from inhalation of toxic gases. If reliable means of predicting toxic product yields in real-scale fires were developed, lives could be saved and costs reduced. Combustion toxicity is generally underestimated in small-scale tests, and is highly dependent on fire conditions. The project will quantify combustion toxicity using the unique design of the steady state tube furnace (SSTF) (ISO TS 19700), which allows full-scale fire behaviour, under different fire conditions, to be replicated on a small scale. Crucially, it will also use UCLan's new custom-designed Large Instrumented Fire Enclosure (LIFE) facility based at Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service's Training Centre to investigate the relationship between scales as a function of temperature and ventilation condition. This apparatus is based on a half-scale ISO 9705 room with corridor, as a reference scenario for generation of toxic products from fire, in order to validate bench-scale (ISO 19700) data for use in engineering hazard calculations, and provide crucial information on the behaviour of under-ventilated fires. The outcomes of the work have direct relevance to the fire safety engineering community (in order to predict escape times based on fire toxicity and visual obscuration) while understanding the transition to highly toxic, under-ventilated fires will save lives, and reduce costs. It will also provide materials scientists with the tools to optimise products for lower fire toxicity suitable for high risk application such as mass transport or high rise buildings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work will save lives, reduce injuries and save money. It is the final obstacle to the quantification of fire smoke as part of a fire hazard assessment. The immediate beneficiaries will be building specifiers and fire safety engineers, who will be able to base their assessments on a sound scientific footing, and make better judgements on selection of materials, products, and methods of construction. This will have three direct impacts - one on the manufacturing sector to address areas where fire toxicity is critical; another to stimulate regulators to ensure that their test protocols are in accordance with the best available information in high risk applications such as mass transport and defence; and a third to ensure that the fire safety of new, sustainable low energy buildings is not compromised. Materials developers will benefit greatly from being able to identify the components responsible for fire gas toxicity in real-scale fires so they can improve the fire safety of their products. The beneficiaries are represented in many sectors of UK industry. The last 10-20 years have seen a dramatic increase in the amount and variety of plastic and polymer products in homes, offices and public buildings. At the same time the fire hazard has also become an increasingly important issue. Some commercial materials and products such as brominated flame retardants in common use are under scrutiny for risks to the environment and to human health. The establishment of a small-scale apparatus to accurately model burning behaviour in large-scale fires would significantly reduce the need for expensive, large-scale tests, particularly at the materials development stage, and inform the design of a new safer generation materials and products of reduced combustion-toxicity. This work is also aimed at regulators and specifiers to ensure that their test protocols are in accordance with the best available information. The findings from the project will be reported to British Standards and other national standards bodies via the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) committees where it is anticipated that the outcome will form the basis of new standards for validating input of toxicity data for fire hazard assessment. Ultimately, this will provide the basis of a new simplified method for the measurement and prediction of fire smoke toxicity from materials and products. UK's citizens will gain from lives saved, injuries avoided and better, safer design options through the improved understanding of fire hazard, facilitating improvements in fire safety. Most crucially, the results of this project will be able to make a direct contribution to reducing the number of dwelling fire deaths injuries and injuries (87% and 82% respectively of total fire casualties). While politicians and regulators are reluctant to interfere in issues domestic safety, a major outcome of this project will be a web-based tool allowing householders to undertake their own fire risk assessment, based on the actual contents of their homes. While uptake would always be voluntary, undertaking such assessment may lead to lower insurance premises, and a better informed general public, highlighting the awareness of fire hazards in dwellings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100067</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service</gtr:description><gtr:id>16ED4CCF-02BE-47E9-BEB7-41D538E2791A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications: DOI: 10.1111/1556-4029.12268; DOI: 10.1111/1556-4029.12271</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>A work proposal has been submitted that allowed access to derelict buildings owned by Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service for the measurement of fire and toxicant development in full-scale enclosure fires.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>An informal secondment of the PDRA with the Fire Investigators in Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service.

This means it is possible to quantify the fire toxicity of materials and products so they may be eliminated from the most hazardous situations. 

The construction products regulations require that all building materials sold in Europe must be classified according to their reaction-to-fire properties. At present this is limited to flame spread and heat release. however, as a result of this work demonstrating that fire toxicity is important, and can easily be quantified in the laboratory the European Commission announced (on 15th November 2015) their intention to conduct a feasibility study on incorporation of fire toxicity into the construction products regulations. This tender document for the study is expected to be released in March 2016. We have been told unofficially that Mr Gwenole Cozigoou (Director of the Directorate for Resources Based, Manufacturing and Consumer Goods Industries at the European Commission) intends to announce details of the tender process at the conference on Fire Toxicity taking place at UCLan in Preston on March 21-23rd 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>41D08514-15E1-44B9-865F-524386CFCFC7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Inhaling toxic fire smoke is the biggest cause of death and injury from unwanted fires. Surprisingly, outside the mass transport industries (rail, air and sea) there is no regulation controlling the fire toxicity of nay materials or products. 

This project demonstrated a clear relationship between the toxicity of large scale fires and those from the laboratory scale steady state tube furnace (SSTF). As the SSTF was being developed as a standard for quantification of fire toxicity in ISO, this provided crucial evidence to underpin the validity of the technique. 

A wide range of materials were tested, including plastics, wood, insulation materials and electronic cables, fire toxicity quantified, and the relationship between laboratory and large scale fire toxicity was shown.

The work provides essential information for architects, builders, building specifiers ad fire safety engineers to be able to quantify the fire toxicity of new and existing building, in order to minimise the toll of death and serious injury resulting from unwanted fires. 

A database of the fire toxicity from these materials is now available for use in engineering hazard calculations to enable fire safety professionals to provide life safety analysis (e.g. to estimate the time available for escape from a burning buildings).

This project identified three key direct impacts - one on the manufacturing sector to address areas where fire toxicity is critical; another to stimulate regulators to ensure that their test protocols are in accordance with the best available information, particularly in high risk applications such as mass transport and defence; and a third to ensure that the fire safety of new, sustainable low energy buildings is not compromised.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The data relating to the combustion toxicity of particular materials was provided to the individual manufacturers who supplied the samples, and fed into international databases via the various professional institutions. We found that different materials developers (polymer producers, cable makers, insulation manufacturers etc.) benefited greatly from being able to identify the components responsible for fire gas toxicity, so they can improve the fire safety of their products. 

The data generated had also a clear impact also on both the wider fire safety community and the general public. Fire safety engineers (FSEs): Fire Safety Consultancies, such as Arup are now able to base their assessments on a sound scientific footing, and make better judgments on selection of materials, products designs, and methods of construction. Academic FSE departments (e.g. University of Edinburgh, Technical University of Denmark, University of Queensland) are able to educate future graduates in the assessment of toxic hazards from fires. Fire fighters increased their awareness about the risk of fire smoke exposure, appropriate recognition of the signs and symptoms of various fire effluents, as well as a comprehensive understanding of toxic interactions.

Finally, this work have had a major impact on National and International Standardization. The findings from the project were used in ISO TC92 SC3 to support the development of standards for quantification of fire toxicity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D7FA3460-ACE1-4566-A2A6-F44A9CB37BCF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Education,Electronics,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A set of four portable analysers have been developed for the simultaneous measurements of CO, CO2, hydrocarbons, oxygen, and hydrogen cyanide and HCl, HBr, NO2, etc..

There have been a number of stages in their development, these include

1. The construction of an original prototype

2. Initial fault-finding with redesign and construction.

3. Characterisation and calibration of mass flow and volume measurements.

4. In-field testing on the fire propagation apparatus (FPA) at University of Edinburgh.

The original LIFE construction was built with calcium silicate board. This material proved unable to withstand the temperatures of the sizes of fire necessary to achieve under-ventilation. For this reason the original walls were replaced with fire-grade masonry and the new walls were topped with a steel roof (with insulation). 

2. Data suggested that the airflow into the apparatus was being over-measured. Detailed investigation showed that the air movement through the inlet channel did not approximate plug flow. The air inlet channel was redesigned and fitted with new, better performing, instrumentation. The new instrumentation was characterised using a wind tunnel.

3. It proved difficult to achieve under-ventilated combustion in the early version of the apparatus due to extra air reaching the combustion chamber by leaking in through the outlet channel. The outlet channel was reconstructed with a ceramic fibre restriction in order to restrict the counterflow of effluent.

4. It was found that the temperature measurements taken in the enclosure did not describe the combustion conditions adequately. A new thermocouple tree was placed in the interface between the room and corridor. This extra data allows the interface between the upper and lower layers to be understood more definitely.

5. It has been found that the original gas analysers sustain damage when operated under negative pressure. The analysers have been modified to work under positive pressure.</gtr:description><gtr:id>75A08EC5-D95A-47F1-9C79-4AF34B37EB67</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The LIFE facility was improved and completely rebuilt which allowed further, more complex, tests to be carried out.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>The LIFE facility completely rebuilt</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved Technique/Technology</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A novel field deployable device for the measurement of equivalence ratio is under final construction.
