Infection control for wounds is a contentious issue, particularly against a background of the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) epidemic. Furthermore, treatment of wound infections represents a significant economic burden on NHS resources and the quality of life of patients. Dressings and bandages have a major part to play in the modern management of wounds, with silver-containing dressings being the most commonly used for skin wounds. While these treatments have made great strides in reducing microbial bioburden, there may be potential cytotoxic issues regarding high concentrations of silver needed for reducing infection.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent antimicrobial agent and has a proven role in wound repair which makes it an excellent candidate for the treatment of wound infections. The aim of this HIP is to improve upon the current silver technologies by embedding NO releasing silver nanoparticles (NP) into state of the art prototype bandages that will exploit NO's dual wound repair and antimicrobial function. These nanoparticles have been developed with previous EPSRC-funded funding (EP/M027325/1 Engineering Nitric Oxide Delivery Platforms for Wound Healing Applications) and we have shown the NO releasing nanoparticles to be extremely potent at killing bacteria present at very high concentrations. This proposal builds on this work by taking on a &amp;quot;personalised medicine&amp;quot; approach and tailoring release rates and concentrations of NO in different formulations for treating infections in the skin and eye. 

We have brought together clinical project partners with specific and complementary skills in skin wound infection and healing, and surface ocular wound infection and healing. Our commercial partners include a world leading US company that specialises in the fabrication, characterisation, and integration of nanomaterials into products and systems and a UK based SME that is at the forefront of reconstructed in vitro skin technologies that is innovating skincare research and development. Through this partnership, we will develop the clinical applicability, and the technical and commercial viability of antimicrobial NO releasing nanoparticles and their incorporation into bandages to accelerate the bench-to-clinic impact of the proposed research. 
 
NO-releasing nanoparticles will be fabricated and optimised to deliver a controlled and sustained release of the therapeutic. We have successfully tethered NO releasing functional groups to silver and gold nanoparticles with control over NO payload. These are first linked to a high molecular weight polymer coatings and then the polymer is conjugated to the particle to ensure high stability. We will optimise the rate of delivery and the amount of site-specific generated NO by controlling the size and shape of the NPs. All NP preparations will be evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against clinically relevant bacterial and fungal strains and their cytocompatibility. These nanoparticles will then be embedded into prototype bandages made from either electrospun polyurethane and alginate or peptide hydrogels depending on their potential application to skin or corneal wounds, respectively. The efficacy of the bandages containing the NO releasing NPs will be tested in in vitro assays and in ex vivo and in vitro 3D models. The development of this technology offers sustainable effective and economic solutions without contributing to the AMR epidemic while simultaneously participating in scientifically excellent, industrially relevant research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The partnership aligns with the investment priorities set out by the prosperity outcomes of the EPSRC delivery plan, specifically in terms of productivity and health. The technology developed will be world-leading and if successful, can be used to improve the quality for health and resilience of communities as it does not lead to AMR and is revolutionary in its ability to treat infections.

Academic: The development of smart dressings to prevent infection without causing AMR while simultaneously encouraging tissue regeneration will have an impact on wider academic communities working in antimicrobial surfaces, wound healing, biomaterials and tissue engineering. The University of Liverpool (UoL) has seven institutional research themes, three of which (Materials for the Future, Global Health and Personalised Medicine) have direct impact on the proposed research. Engagement with these themes will bring together multi-disciplinary collaborators on a new area of research which will impact the university's research strategies. UoL has Open Innovation Hub for Antimicrobial Surfaces which interfaces with industry and health institutes. The PI has membership in this Hub which will allow for the research to be ideally placed for achieving maximum impact.
Commercial: The global epidemic of AMR is the driving force behind the EPSRC'S Grand Challenge for developing future therapies that enhance efficacy of treatment, minimise cost and reduce risk to patients without causing AMR. Indeed the Department of Health has a five year plan with 'Smart surfaces and dressings to prevent infection' as a key research area. The development of antimicrobial bandages to treat wound infections holds a considerable market opportunity, which may stimulate the economic competitiveness of the UK while boosting the UK's global economic performance. This technology that has been developed during previous EPSRC funding is currently filed with the UoL Business Gateway department for IP protection. It should be noted that both the PI and CoI have prior experience of IP protection, patent application processes and the licensing of technologies. This follow on funding will accelerate the impact of this healthcare technology via the industrial partners. nanoComposix, Inc, a world leading nanoparticle company is keen to feed the technology into their product pipeline, to accelerate maximum impact of the research. Innovenn Ltd, is a UK based SME that has a strong background in wound care and regulatory pathways and as such will enable us to take the first step towards clinical trials should the technology reach the appropriate stage, in order for it to be on the fast-track to achieving maximum impact.
 
Clinical: The National Prescribing Centre (NPC) has stated that there is no robust clinical evidence that dressings containing antimicrobials are more effective than unmedicated dressings for the prevention or treatment of wound infections. Indeed, the NPC has stated that NHS health professionals will routinely choose the least expensive dressing unless a specific dressing can be adequately justified on clinical grounds and this indiscriminate selection of antimicrobial dressings is not the best way forward given risks of AMR and toxicity issues. Therefore, the development of new wound care technologies needs to have appropriate clinical input to achieve impact in clinic. Engagement with the clinician partners Professor Stephen Kaye and Dr Keli Kolegraff ensure that maximum impact of research outputs aligned with clinically relevant endpoints are reached. 
 
Personnel: The multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral nature of the project will ensure that the PDRAs employed will build on their research expertise and will have a major impact on their career and should lead to future leadership roles, thereby, benefitting the UK as a whole through strengthening its research base and bringing forward new talent.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>866662</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P023223/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BD108981-2A72-4C45-AAC2-425461EB90BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomaterials</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
