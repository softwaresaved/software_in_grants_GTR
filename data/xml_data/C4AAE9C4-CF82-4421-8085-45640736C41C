For smart cities, this dependency will only grow. This means that societal and economic consequences of power outages, especially for longer outages, can be severe. The future smart city scenario will be powered by a highly decentralized energy system where energy demand is partially supplied by decentralized renewable energy resources from wind, sun, and cogeneration. To maximally utilize the renewable energy in the urban environment and optimize costs, a significant amount of buildings will be equipped with generation and even energy storage capabilities. This approach radically differs from existing energy systems which are based on highly centralized energy provisioning. The decentralized energy system will depend on a large scale complex ICT system to control energy demand and supply; jointly, this system is known as the smart grid. The result is on one side a system which is vulnerable to faults in the increasing amount of ICT and grid components, especially from malicious attacks on ICT components. On the other side, the system is more flexible as demand and production can be controlled and decentralized production enables to mitigate single-point-of-failure aspects. 

IRENE focuses on utilizing the decentralized nature of future energy generation to make them more robust to attacks, and on minimizing impact of power outages on associated critical infrastructures such as water and gas supply, communication systems, public transport, and road traffic control. The aim is to understand what social and technical measure should be considered when implementing these new technologies for the benefit of all stakeholders. The main outcome of IRENE is integrated into the collaboration framework that allows cities for different faults/attacks to collaborate with their stakeholders to mitigate security risks in energy systems, understand minimum operational power requirements and system dependencies, create decentralised energy inventory and support the sharing of power at times if need in an equitable and fair way for all city stakeholders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Cyber security defence mechanisms and strategies for Smart Grids must be developed, as the impact of any malfunction directly reflects on society and its well-being. Hence a secure and reliable Smart Grid is needed. The solutions developed by IRENE will help city administrations, DSOs and operators of other critical infrastructures to develop, plan and evaluate appropriate measures for mitigating power outages. IRENE does not only take into consideration short-term outages with limited impact but also long-term outages with severe impact on critical urban infrastructures. It supports the development of social and technical methodologies that will assist stakeholders to collaborate and increase the resilience of the future power networks and significantly reduce the impact on urban society and economy. IRENE will assist member states to develop policies that will protect European citizens from attacks or disruptions on the power network. The IRENE open collaboration framework available to any potential user supports an increase in social engagement between local power generators and the surrounding urban community. Thus IRENE will improve the way the existing Smart Grid complex system is managed, monitored and integrated with groups, public bodies and enterprises,
Research steps and business innovation that IRENE will foster towards its goal are several:
a) Threats and vulnerability analysis methodologies and techniques, as well as societal impact of attacks and profiling of attackers.
b) Cyber-security assessment methodologies, with emphasis on quantitative security assessment.
c) Define cyber-attacks that can be reconducted to the appearance of emergent phenomena, and will present a clearer view to policy makers and other stakeholders of the possible threats of cyber-attacks on Smart Grids.
d) Development of collaboration frameworks for city stakeholders
e) Draft set of policy, process and procedure requirements for smart grid protection
In order to assure the above impact, the consortium contains research partners with complementary expertise covering communication (FTW), security and dependability design and assessment (UNIFI), requirements engineering and socio-technical security assessment (UT), Supply demand prediction and balancing (QMUL).
Ethos, who is a member of the British Standards Institute Smart City Technical Advisory Committee (part of a wider global Smart City initiative), will promote the results of IRENE within Smart City standardization bodies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>415094</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Twente</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>IRENE partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7629653-DC54-4B23-B9D8-268FFF5C8958</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One conference paper title &amp;quot;Assessing Loss Event Frequencies of Smart Grid Cyber Threats: Encoding Flexibility into FAIR Using Bayesian Network Approach&amp;quot;

The project has identified the trends that help to ensure resilient electricity supply in Smart Cities: a) the ongoing deployment of Smart Grid technology and b) the adoption of distributed energy resources. Unfortunately, the increased reliance on ICT in the Smart Grid will expose new threats that could result in incidents that might affect urban electricity distribution networks by causing power outages. Diverse specialists will need to cooperate to address these threats. We have outlined a methodology for establishing a collaborative framework that supports the definition of response strategies to threats. We consider the ongoing evolution of the electricity grids and the threats emerging while the grid evolves. We have also outlined possible scenarios of urban grid development and highlight several threats and the strategies of attackers. We also developed a framework and collaboration toolset that aim to foster the collaboration of stakeholders involved in city resilience planning taking into account grid vulnerability and criticality from a city's perspective.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project is still on going so the complete findings have not been taken forward.

The involvements of QMUL in IRENE project are 1) the threat assessment using Bayesian Factor Analysis of Information Risk (BayesianFAIR) to relate individual threat-component to other grid components; 2) the know-hows on the energy model prediction and optimisation for energy distribution planning and; 3) the development of the user-interactive-based overall grid modelling (OGM) tool for grid collaborative planning purposes. Other contributions are the development collaboration framework; Classification of different threats; Design IRENE evaluation method for gaming simulation and stakeholder workshop and; Development of common repository information and participate in relevant events.

The nation is aggressively pushing towards a greener city, or simply a 'smarter city'. Such implementation, however, may need the rigorous strategic positioning of electricity components that make the city more resilient to electricity outages and enhance the sustainability of the future. Through the earlier developed OGM tool, the tool serves as a platform that guides the planning and deployment of smart grid by estimating the monetary costing, threat assessments and energy resilience of energy grid design. It also allows users (city-level stakeholders) to manage the evaluations and reports of the grid design. It can save cities and energy network operators the time and costs of smarter grid deployment. The potential users are city planners, grid operators, researchers and energy consultants.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>383F6DAB-C557-4F75-BAD7-D6FD7C0DEE53</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including
