It has both objective properties (adverse life events and difficulties) and subjective responses (physical or emotional illness). Objective stressors include unemployment, housing or finance events, as well as&amp;nbsp; inter-personal events for example in partner or parenting roles. Personal context is key to understanding the harmful impacts on health. These latter are psychological (eg depression), or physical (eg cardiovascular disease). A new approach, Computerised Life Assessment Record (CLEAR), using latest online digital technology will be designed to mimic the existing ?gold standard? Life Events and Difficulties Schedule to enable a more cost effective measurement approach.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>CLEAR will be tested and delivered online using latest web-based data capture technology. Reliability and validity of the CLEAR instrument will be determined and its association with health outcomes in an existing Depression and Case Control sample (DeCC n=250), and new first year undergraduate students (n=125). Analysis will confirm the comparability of 30 online CLEAR versus LEDS interviews, test CLEAR response stability over time and test stressful events in relation to depression, physical illness and student academic performance.&amp;nbsp; An International Scientific Advisory Board will ensure use of the tool in existing longitudinal health research studies and practice.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research and how? 
i) Practitioners involved in interventions/treatments focused on managing/reducing life stress and its impacts on emotional disorder. This will include practising psychiatrists, psychologists (clinical and health psychologists, psychotherapists and counsellors), and social workers.
 - How benefited: the research findings identifying specific relationships between stress and emotional and physical disorder will aid clinician understanding of the role of stress. In addition, clinicians frequently need to document stressors both at initial assessment and between clinical sessions in order to understand the onset and maintenance of stress-related disorders. For example CBT, counselling and and Interpersonal Therapy is focused on managing stress responses in different domains such as relationships, work, finances etc. The provision of easily collected calendars of stress with details of category, severity and timing will help to focus therapeutic strategy and care provision.
ii) Medical practitioners involved with treatment planning for individuals with physical conditions impaired by high stress levels.
- How benefitted: research findings will add to understanding characteristics of life events and difficulties associated with illness. Providing an easy assessment of patient life stress will aid with providing support and managing treatment plans.
iii) Providers of university education can utilise the findings on stress and academic attainment in 1st year undergraduates to specify the likely stressors occurring for young people entering university for the first time. This will document areas of difficulty and show how these impact on academic performance, satisfaction and course drop-out. The tool can be incorporated into student counselling services.
- How benefited: Aid to targeting student support services and for standardising 'mitigating circumstances' in relation to exam and course work performance.
iii) Wider public and policy understanding of the effects of stress and its management on illness and problem adapatation.
- How benefited: findings of the study will be disseminated to the general population with the new online tool potentially useful in the wider population to identify common stressors. The tool can be adapted for psycho-educational use in relation to feedback of stress profiles with advice about stress management for the public at large.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>385265</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on CLEAR to launch the online stress site</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AB12025-0526-4D81-A6BD-F7094E6BE9B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop on wellbeing was set up for undergraduates in order to mark the launch of the CLEAR online stress tool, to increase visibility, institutional ownership and participation in the project.
