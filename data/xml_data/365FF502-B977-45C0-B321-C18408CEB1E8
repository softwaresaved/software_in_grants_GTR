A 2016 survey for KwikFit by ICM Research estimated the annual total cost of pothole damage to UK motorists was &amp;pound;684m. Research by the Asphalt Industries Alliance (ALARM 2016) identified that the total cost of compensation claims against local authorities in England and Wales for 2015/2016 was &amp;pound;28.4m - 76% of which was directly attributable to potholes. 
Whilst local authorities have a legal responsibility for dealing with damage to roads, they are heavily dependent on issues being reported to them by the general public to enable assessment and repair. The reactive nature of pothole reporting, assessment and repair is inefficient and largely ineffective.

Aims and Objectives:
The aim of the project is to develop technology improving the way local authorities identify and manage potholes, and is designed to enable them to improve roads and reduce costs. The key objectives are:
1. To develop affordable sensor technology to enable a vehicle mounted sensor travelling at speeds of up to 65Km/hr to identify and capture road damage between road kerb and centre line.
2. To classify the road damage for reporting purposes.
3. To provide an image of the damage.
4. To provide an accurate location of the road damage.
5. To create a &amp;quot;learning database&amp;quot; of typical damage parameters.
6. To report the road damage on a store-and-forward or real-time basis.
7. To capture and store data on a cloud based service.
8. To map data so that it is easily understood.
9. To provide web-based access to map based products.

The project will initially focus on delivering a prototype for identifying, classifying, reporting and sharing information on potholes. Real-time applications will be developed following successful demonstration on the initial capability.

Applications and benefits:
The project will provide vehicle mounted sensors which can identify and classify potholes and other road damage, provide an accurate position for the damage to the road, report the occurrence by forwaing to cloud storage and enable the data to be accessed through a web browser showing the data on a map. 
We believe the most effective mechanism to deliver comprehensive mapping of local authority roads will be by mounting the sensors on refuge and recycling waste collection vehicles. This could be supplemented by standalone survey vehicles. Combining data from local authorities would provide comprehensive mapping of a region and potentially the UK.
Benefits include:
1. The creation of a detailed web-based mapping source of potholes in roads for highways agencies, local authorities and private subscribers. The data would include classification of damage, imaging and accurate positioning. This would enable highways authorities and local authorities to make informed decisions on the prioritisation of road repairs and provide private subscribers with a tool to avoid road damage to private vehicles.
2. Real-time data capture and reporting of ground disturbances for military users in operational environments with a risk of improvised explosive device (IED) attack; enabling potential threats to be mitigated.
3. Real-time data capture and reporting of natural and man-made hazards for unmanned precision farming vehicles; enabling avoidance action to be taken before impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of our work would be to reduce the burden to the UK economy; to the local authority, to the motorist, and to insurers of pothole damage to vehicles by providing a value-added service.

From our research proposal the following ones could benefit:
1. Local authority highways departments
2. Highways agencies 
3. Road hauliers and logistics companies
4. Consumers (i.e. private drivers)
5. Insurance companies
6. Providers of on-line road navigation data

The primary market are the UK local authorities which have a responsibility for road repairs together with the Highways Agency. Authorities and agencies would benefit from an improved understanding of the scale and scope of damage and the capability to prioritise and co-ordinate repair activities. Currently local authorities rely on potholes being reported to them by drivers or residents on an ad-hoc basis, together with periodic inspections of A and B roads. They send out an assessor who measures the width and depth of the pothole. If the assessor's measurements show that the pothole is above a threshold, the local authority will send out a maintenance crew to repair the road surface. A maintenance crew consists of several people, a lorry, tarmac and machinery and several crews may be employed across a local authority. In contrast to that, our automated pothole detection, recognition and classification procedure will remove the need for a separate visit by authority assessors allowing potholes to be automatically prioritised by severity for repair in real time. The proposition is to provide accurate information to local authorities daily, identifying potholes in a way which enables them to prioritise and spend their budget in the most efficient way possible. 

In the UK in 2015, damage to vehicles caused by driving over potholes in roads cost motorists &amp;pound;684m in vehicle repairs. Therefore, commercial vehicle operators and consumers would benefit from improved planning of routes to avoid unnecessary damage to ehicles.

Our automated Pothole Identification and Management system will benefit insurance companies as they could adjust their monthly fee depending on the road damage in the area of each client.

It is also to provide this information to motorists through real-time satnav updates which alert drivers with pothole warnings and allow them to reduce their speed and to take evasive measures.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150944</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R005400/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
