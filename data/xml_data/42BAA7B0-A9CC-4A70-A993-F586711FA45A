However, the overuse of antibiotics in populations can lead to the disease causing bacteria becoming drug resistant over time. For example, high levels of resistance have been found in gastroenteritis causing bacteria to antibiotics like ampicillin (52.3% - 84.6%), cotrimoxazole (45.5% - 65%), and cephalexin (15.9% - 59.7%) across five sites in India and South Africa. This antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat because it can reverse the advances made in combating life threatening infections and increase the costs of treatment and hospital stays for the sick, making newer antibiotics even more inaccessible to the poorest and most vulnerable. 

One major reason for the overuse of antibiotics in humans is antibiotic over-dispensing and over-prescribing by health care providers. This is a big challenge in low and middle income countries where health systems are weak, regulatory frameworks for health workers and the pharmaceutical industry either do not exist or are weakly enforced, and the majority of poor and rural populations rely on informally trained and unlicenced providers who use antibiotics excessively and inappropriately in their treatments. These informal providers or IPs may constitute from 50% to 96% of all providers in LMICs, including in India, but there is very little in-depth knowledge of the factors that influence their inappropriate antibiotic use and what interventions can feasibly and effectively arrest this inappropriate use. Evidence from the formal sector suggests that antibiotic use is influenced by socio-cultural, behavioural and economic factors. However the precise nature of these factors and how they interact has not been explored in the case of IPs.

In this field study we propose to study a cross section of IPs, and the drivers of their antibiotic use in the state of West Bengal in India. Since IPs lack a clear legal status, few government programmes are willing to engage with them, but the West Bengal government has decided to train and harness more than 100,000 IPs as village health workers, from early 2016. We are therefore locating this timely study in West Bengal. We will explore provider related factors and also the perceptions of communities and various government stakeholders. This will be done through 200 structured and 30 in-depth interviews and observations of IP practices in two socio-economically different districts (Birbhum and South24 Parganas), accompanied by focus groups discussions with community members and key informant interviews with government, pharmaceutical and formal medical sector stakeholders. We will use these findings to conceptualise interventions to reduce antibiotic use among IPs and seek feedback from study participants on the feasibility and effectiveness of these interventions. 

The study will be implemented by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in collaboration with the Liver Foundation, a non-governmental organisation in West Bengal that has worked with IPs since 2007 and has championed the harnessing of IPs with the state government. We will use the final study outcomes to develop a proposal with the state government to implement and evaluate these interventions in the future, possibly starting in mid to late 2017.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This is an exploratory study of the social, economic and behavioural drivers of antibiotic use in informal providers in rural areas of the state of West Bengal in India. In pluralistic health systems of low and middle income countries (LMICs), including in India, the bulk of healthcare at first contact is delivered by providers who may not have a formal medical qualification but practice a range of biomedical treatments, including treatment with antibiotics. They are known by different names such as drug sellers, village doctors or rural medical practitioners and are found all over Asia and Africa. Evidence suggests that their antibiotic use is high and irrational, and interventions that have focused on training and recognition of IPs have not succeeded in lowering their antibiotic use. Antibiotic use is one of the most critical components of IPs' quality of care that needs to be addressed urgently. Excessive dispensing/prescription of antibiotics by healthcare providers including IPs in LMICs is one of the reasons for overuse of antibiotics in humans leading to increasing antibiotic resistance which is a major global health threat today.

We will conduct structured interviews with a sample of 100 IPs each in two districts (total 200), selected through stratified random sampling, followed by in-depth interviews and observations at 30 IP clinics, focus group discussions with community members and key informant interviews with government, pharmaceutical and formal medical sector representatives. In small group workshops with IPs, communities, and with the other stakeholders, we will present ideas for different interventions and seek feedback from participants on what they think would be the most effective and feasible. This will help us develop a plan for implementing and evaluating a comprehensive intervention in future.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our team shares a common goal and commitment to improve the quality of healthcare available at first contact to poor, rural, and remote populations that face severe limitations of health care access and affordability from the formal sector. Informal providers are the mainstay for most healthcare needs of these populations. It is critical to harness the advantages of geographical access and basic knowledge of common illnesses that IPs present while simultaneously intervening in harmful practices such as inappropriate antibiotic use. However comprehensive interventions that reduce inappropriate antibiotic use but at the same time utilise IPs to expand access to essential antibiotics have been few because of IPs' blurred legal status as healthcare providers and also because of the opposition of the formal medical sector. We require a combination of strong evidence, constant engagement with key stakeholders, and effective communication and advocacy to bring about a change in this situation.

Our pathway to impact is also a 'pathway to change', and our proposed research represents an initial step in that pathway to change. We nurture a long term view of this change and we will strive to accomplish this in stages. The immediate impact of our research will be the development of an intervention addressing antibiotics use, that will be integrated within the state government's overall IP training programme to improve quality of care of more than 100,000 IPs in the state over five to ten years. The likelihood of success of this intervention will be maximised by its development through engagement and feedback solicited from IPs, communities, the government and formal medical sector representatives in the state. The final blueprint of an intervention will be presented and discussed in a policy engagement meeting with senior officials from the health department, and also from the private formal medical sector. In the mid-term, this is likely to increase the likelihood of success of our intervention to reduce antibiotic use, thereby leading, in the long term to better quality of health care by IPs and better health outcomes in rural and underprivileged communities. 

We will also pursue a sustained communication and advocacy drive to foster the uptake of our study findings by other states in India and also in other countries. We have a senior government official from Uttar Pradesh state on our advisory committee who will champion IP related policy shifts and action in his state, with our team's support (using research briefs, presentations and media articles). To build global opinion we will benefit from the presence of two international academics on our advisory committee. With their help we will disseminate our findings to relevant research, policy and action groups including the LSHTM's AMR group, the ReACT (Action for Antibiotic Resistance) network, the Private Sector Thematic group and the Health Systems Hub, an electronic networking platform. We will have discussion meetings with other groups engaged with developing IP interventions in Asia and Africa (we have one such person on our advisory committee). We will also produce formal academic articles for high impact journals, so that our findings can inform and influence the international health community. 

Institutional strengthening: As this study is set up as a collaboration between the LSHTM and the Liver Foundation in West Bengal, who will be networking closely with the government of West Bengal, there will be a positive impact on all the teams. There will be a reciprocal sharing of skills and experiences. The team at Liver Foundation will strengthen their research, writing and policy engagement skills. The international counterparts will gain greater understanding of local realities and challenges.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100509</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P004512/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E4AF608A-CDB6-4CE6-AA10-95B3E043E22F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.1  Organisation and delivery of services</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
