His innovation was to highlight a long list of episodes from the history of science which seem to suggest that any successful explanations and predictions issuing from a scientific theory should not persuade us that the theory is true, or even approximately true. Since then Laudan's historical cases have been carefully assessed, and as a result the pendulum has gradually swung back in the realist's favour. Realists claim that each case on Laudan's list is either irrelevant (eg. because not successful enough to warrant a realist commitment), or that when one looks at the scientific posits which really *did work* to bring about scientific successes, the posits are indeed true or approximately true (according to current thinking).

This new project addresses a very specific, very popular scientific realist position, which has been developed in direct response to Laudan's challenge:

When a scientific theory (broadly construed) brings about substantial scientific successes (eg. novel predictions), then the elements of that theory which *did the work* to bring about those successes are very likely at least approximately true.

This position survives Laudan's examples, but that hardly means that there are not *further* examples in the history of science which show this new realist position to be wrongheaded. The blunt truth is, as things stand *nobody has any idea whether or not there are a significant number of episodes in the history of science which together contradict this modern realist position*. This fundamental gap in our knowledge will be remedied by this new project. By introducing a range of new case studies to the literature it will establish a solid starting point from which the noted realist position will become properly assessed in light of the historical record.

Essential to properly establish the new cases is a novel collaboration between philosophers, historians, and scientists. Philosophers and historians of science have been working together at least since the 1960s, but historians have never been explicitly asked for help in searching for new relevant case studies. And yet the breadth of knowledge and specific research skills of historians of science are invaluable when it comes to finding and presenting historical case studies - suitably interpreted, in their cultural context - as evidence for/against scientific realism.

In addition philosophers can also benefit from the knowledge and specific research skills of scientists. This possibility has been completely overlooked in the debate as conducted over the past thirty years, but pertinent case studies are sometimes discussed in scientific literature quite foreign to the philosopher. This project will actively engage relevant scientists. And by bringing together relevant philosophers, historians, and scientists, a novel nucleus of individuals will be formed who could effectively work together in a major follow-up project, where the newly identified case studies would be thoroughly assessed.

At its heart this project is exploratory: given the current dynamics of the realism debate there is urgent need to explore the history of science in a way that hasn't been systematically attempted before. A search for new case studies has been warranted for some time, since extensive testing of philosophical positions (if possible) is epistemically imperative just as it is for scientific positions. But right now the proposed scoping exercise is especially urgent, since we have at hand a very explicit, established realist position which defines the type of historical case study which would be relevant. Until this position has been tested, we can't know the true nature and value of scientific research: whether it is essentially cumulative or not is still in doubt. And science by itself does nothing to help us answer this question.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This pilot project is designed to open up a space for a new phase of the scientific realism debate, hopefully to be explored in a major follow-up project. At that point it will be appropriate to explore significant public dissemination opportunities, including public lectures, radio, and a documentary. Paul Ging, Communications Manager in the Communications Office at Durham University, has contacts in radio and is able to set up a meeting with a radio broadcaster. And the Institute of Communications Studies at the University of Leeds has expressed an interest in helping me to develop a pilot documentary (with the help of students at the Institute).

But in this pilot project, impact outside academia will be limited to that discussed in the following sections.


WHO MIGHT BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?

Interested lay-persons will benefit intellectually from the website, especially the podcasts of the presentations at the workshop and colloquium. Such persons will include the general public, but also science journalists and communicators, and certain public figures such as scientific advisors. This intellectual benefit may then help to inform actions in various ways (eg. better informed decisions concerning issues of scientific policy). Ultimately the project concerns the question of what exactly we should trust in science, and how much we should trust it. A better understanding on this issue has the potential to filter down into the wider community and affect various actions in indirect ways.


HOW MIGHT THEY BENEFIT?

The persons mentioned above will benefit intellectually by taking in the information on the project website, and listening to the podcasts of the presentations at the workshop and colloquium. The hope is that people working in science-related professions would then benefit by being able to communicate more effectively with public consumers (eg. health professionals communicating with patients; communication between scientists and ethics committees; public relations for high-energy physics experiments like the Large Hadron Collider). Public opinion on science has a major influence on which actions are open to persons working in a range of science-related professions, and this project will affect public opinion which in turn will affect those actions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20765</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The major output of this pilot project was my paper 'A Confrontation of Convergent Realism', published in the journal *Philosophy of Science*. This paper shows the extent of the historical challenge to scientific realism, with a long list of examples from the history of science where a theory was successful, but turned out to be radically false (not even approximately true). The paper opens the doorway for a new era in the scientific realism debate, where the realist tackles these historical challenges one by one. My paper also indicates how the realist might proceed on this front. But the real work will take many years, no doubt. My new, major AHRC project running August 2014-January 2018 is starting to make a difference in this direction.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The major concrete finding is the list of twenty examples from the history of science where a scientific theory was false, and yet somehow managed to be successful. The paper where these examples are published shows why they are, on the face of it, challenges to contemporary realism. The realist can now defend herself against these challenges by tackling the cases one at a time. If the realist can accommodate these challenges, showing why they aren't devastating for realism, that will significantly strengthen the realist position. Whatever the case, this is a significant step forward in the debate, showing what the realist must do next for realism to remain viable.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EB37661D-D44E-4161-9CDF-3B2BD3D9221F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://community.dur.ac.uk/evaluating.realism/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6A236BD5-74B5-45E0-9953-0B4835D1106A"><gtr:id>6A236BD5-74B5-45E0-9953-0B4835D1106A</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Confrontation of Convergent Realism</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophy of Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/36222bdcb75b6b67f6e0f6ad0b206b42"><gtr:id>36222bdcb75b6b67f6e0f6ad0b206b42</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vickers P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J011142/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C6428B5-4A75-42D5-9D5B-5DF34F513B7E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science &amp; Maths, &amp; Math Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
