When the atom emits or absorbs light, electrons jump between two different orbitals, whose energy difference gives the frequency of the emitted or absorbed light.
Light emitters, from common lamps to laboratory lasers, work on this principle and the material they are made of is chosen to have transitions at the frequency of the desired light. 
When the atoms are in presence of a strong electric field, the situation becomes more complex, as the field modifies the existing orbitals or splits them into multiple ones, giving rise to new possible transitions.

Some of these transitions would be very useful to produce devices emitting in the so-called terahertz range, that is light whose frequency lays between the radio waves and the infrared. Today we lack practical sources of terahertz light. This is really unfortunate because of the useful properties of such radiation. 
Terahertz radiation passes through paper, fabric, and even biological tissues to a limited extent, yet, contrary to X rays, it is safe for humans and it can thus be applied in a number of fields, from medical imaging to security scanners.

While, as explained above, some transitions in atoms under strong electric fields do lay in the terahertz domain, it is not possible to harness them to realize terahertz sources, either because the very shape of orbitals in naturally occurring atoms makes it impossible for an electron to jump between them, or because the involved process becomes possible only if multiple electrons interact between them. This is rather difficult as electrons on different atoms are so far apart that they almost do not see each other.

The idea at the heart of my proposal is to use instead of real atoms, artificial ones, in which the electrons, instead of orbiting around nuclei, are trapped in a nanometric trap called a quantum well, a sort of sandwich made of slices of different materials, each the width of few atomic layers. This
 confines the electrons between the two &amp;quot;bread&amp;quot; slices. The interest of these artificial atoms is that, on one side, we can modify the shape of the electronic orbitals by properly engineering the form and the size of the well and, on the other side, as many electrons are present inside the same well, interaction between them is much stronger than in atomic systems. Using artificial atoms in presence of strong electric fields, it is thus possible to harness new transitions to realize cheap, efficient and tunable terahertz sources.

The interaction of light and matter at the quantum level, the domain in which I worked during most of my career, is a fascinating field. Not only has it helped to revolutionize our understanding of the world, as the effort to explain absorption and emission spectra was one of the driving forces that led to the development of quantum theory, but it has deeply modified our everyday life. Lasers and optoelectronic technologies are today everywhere: in our computers, in our medical devices, in our communication infrastructure. 

This present project aims to both deepen our understanding of the fundamental physics behind optical transitions in artificial atoms and pave the way to a new generation of terahertz emitters that in a few decades could find their ways to a number of life-saving applications, from airport scanners to medical imaging.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The central idea behind this proposal is to use intersubband transitions in doped semiconductor quantum wells to create a new generation of efficient and tunable integrated lasers and radiation emitters in the terahertz (THz) spectral range.

Notwithstanding its importance for practical applications, from security scanners to medical imaging, the THz region represents today a technological gap for which we lack practical emitters.
While a few commercial THz systems already exist, the results of the present project, reducing both fabrication and operating costs, will allow for a much wider deployment.
The results of the present proposal, leading to the diffusion of commercial THz emitters, will thus have a great impact on the wider public, both trough direct technological advancement and through its contributions to the national health, wealth and culture.

THz radiation penetrates fabric and plastics, and explosives and narcotics have a distinct spectral signature in the THz. This allows for THz radiation to be used in remote surveillance to uncover concealed weapons, narcotics or to detect hazardous gases. As the detection can be targeted to very specific material targets, this will allow to implement remote active detection systems while avoiding privacy concerns. In few decades THz sensing could substitute cumbersome and dangerous airport security scans, with great gains not only in terms of comfort, avoiding time-consuming security checks in airports, but also of health [actual figures show that around 100 people per year get cancer from airport X-ray scanners, see D. J. Brenner, Radiology 259, 6 (2011)].

On the same line, the diffusion of THz emitters will allow to improve worldwide health allowing for safer and better medical imaging, especially to detect epithelial cancer (Carcinomas, making up about 85% of total cancers cases).

THz radiation has been shown to have groundbreaking applications also in wi-fi transmission, achieving bandwidths 20 times larger than actual wi-fi technologies [K. Ishigaki, Elect. Lett. 48, 582 (2012)]. Applications in optical fibers has played a major role to push the development of technology at the telecom wavelength. Application to wi-fi technology will, in the same way, foster the development and deployment of THz technology. 

Museums, archaeologists and cultural heritage professionals will also benefit from the proposed technology. THz radiation has many applications in these domains, allowing, for example, to see murals hidden beneath coats of plaster or paint in centuries-old buildings. While these applications have already been tested [J. B. Jackson et al., Opt. Comm. 281, 527 (2008)] the present state of technology does not allow for a wide diffusion.

Many actors in the private sector will also greatly benefit from the present research, thanks to its many applications to the industry. Already the ability of THz radiation to pass through plastic and cardboard opens many possibilities to nondestructive quality control of packaged goods, but its greatest potentiality in this domain is the possibility to use it in the fault analysis of semiconductors, where it can be used to remotely evaluate various semiconductor wafer properties [S. Nashima et al., J. Appl. Phys. 90, 837 (2001)].

During the two years of this grant or in its aftermath, many skilled researchers will be trained, being then in a privileged position to open startups and academic spinouts to exploit the developed technology.

The early creation of local technological startups will attract large amounts of VC founding and it will allow to further train more skilled technicians and applied researchers, making of the UK the world leader in the development and production of this new generation of THz technology, with great advantages both in terms of wealth, of occupation and of worldwide national prestige.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97908</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant allowed us to develop a better understanding of how to generate terahertz radiation in semiconductor quantum wells.
