By simultaneously measuring its impact on worker activity, it will also develop a method to draw inference regarding the impact of malaria beyond the study context. Finally, by offering access to malaria treatment and insurance, the study will estimate the conditional demand for malaria treatment. 

The research outcomes have three potential impacts: both on a larger literature in public health and labor economics and on the policy of malaria eradication internationally. 

Regarding the first area of impact, the study will assess the causal effect of health on productivity. Existing work on this is still scarce as it has been difficult to identify due to the dual causality between health and productivity. This study would isolate a single pathway and can control for other potential confounding unobservable factors such as worker motivation, ability, previous health investments, disease or morbidity history, and genetic characteristics, because the distribution of these unobservable characteristics would be identical between the treatment and control groups.

In a second area of impact, the study would produce more detailed information on the potential benefits of malaria reduction or eradication as a development strategy. These effects are currently imprecisely understood because of the lack of rigorous studies that take into account the implications of unobservable plantation, household and individual characteristics. This study will advance policy understanding in this regard.

In a third area, the study will provide constructive advice and ways forward on how to provide access to treatment for agricultural workers. It will allow estimation of workers' willingness to pay and hence provide concrete ways forward on how to offer access to malaria treatment and insurance in rural areas, which may help remove constraints on growth in agricultural productivity. By incorporating detailed social network information for each worker, a potentially important determinant of take-up of malaria testing and treatment will be formally integrated into the analysis. 

The co-leadership and active involvement of the Centre for Research and Development at the Federal University of Technlogy at Yola, warrants that the findings will feed into both the Nigerian national academic and policy debates and maximizes its impact on policymaking, as the Centre has an exemplary track record in this area and its advice has been well absorbed by policymakers. 

The project will also have an impact on the further development of the Centre's capacity with staff and students actively involved. We envisage that both masters and undergraduate students of the Parasite and Tropical Health Research unit, as well as laboratory science students will be part of the implementation team and participate in the analysis. 

The proposal fits very well with the country malaria eradication strategy. The implementation of the on-going research was coordinated with the National Malaria Control Program within the Ministry of Health through a number of meetings, and was actively supported by the Director (then Dr Sofola). 

Prof. Oladele Akogun is an integral part of this research. As Director of the Centre for Research and Development at the Federal University of Technology at Yola, Nigeria, he also actively engages a community of senior and junior researchers, as well as students in the research. Through the pilot, the project has already built capacity by actively involving masters, undergraduate and laboratory students in the implementation and analysis. 

The research has also engaged Nigeria APSF, which is IFPRI's Nigeria Country Program which prefunded an initial feasibility study. There are also close contacts with The World Bank, USAID, DFID, and malaria experts in UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>206854</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Radiation Oncology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Plantation management and firm</gtr:description><gtr:id>F2CF79A7-CC31-49B6-A911-23BB58DB604E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three policy notes were produced to summarise the most relevant insights of the research for the plantation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partnership between the researchers and the plantation springs from the complementary efforts by both parties. the plantation supported and allowed the organization of the field research, including many suggestions regarding its implementation.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have developed a strong partnership with the plantation management and owners of the firm.

The purpose of this conference was to communicate and get feedback on final results from the first phase and preliminary results of the second phase of the research. The conference was well attended, including representatives from The National Malaria Control Programme at the Federal Ministry of Health, The Ministry of Health of Adamawa State, The Malaria Consortium (which brings together experts working on malaria in Nigeria), Ministry of Agriculture, The World Bank, and various journalists. 

The conference was accompanied by three policy notes summarising findings. The conference resulted in two press articles in national newspapers in Nigeria. The results were also discussed in two blogs, one oriented towards the development community, and one towards the general public. 
Several feedback meetings were held with the plantation management, who has shown and active interest to continue and extend this work, and future extensions are currently under discussion. 

In addition to stakeholder conferences and meetings with the plantation management, results were presented to the Chief Economist (DFID) in February 2015 and a multidisciplinary panel at the upcoming 2016 American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene which includes policymakers and nongovernmental organizations active in malaria policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2021E8AC-D06C-47D0-90E9-3D039CEF91C9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Project summary
The consequences of ill health for productivity and economic development are presumed to be severe yet the rigorous evidence base for such a linkage is small. In previous work, statistically significant and large intent to treat effects were estimated on earnings, labor supply and productivity of a curative malaria treatment at a large sugarcane plantation in Nigeria. A mobile health clinic was established on the plantation and used an exogenously determined ordering of workers to test and treat workers. Despite large treatment effects, we find that workers have low rates of seeking curative and preventative treatments. To better understand this puzzle, this study offers access to malaria treatment and insurance at exogenously varied prices to estimate its effect on take-up and frequency of health care. In another phase, the study also measured the effect of treatment on both worker productivity and physical activity. This will allow estimation of the effects of malaria on physical activity in general, and allow us to extrapolate our findings in this context to other physical occupations in endemic areas. 

Research activities 
The field work was fully implemented, but the timing was adapted. Severe flooding in the study area forced us to postpone fieldwork slightly and re-arrange research plans, as explained in the progress report. We requested and received a one year extension of our grant to enable us to deliver the research originally proposed with limited tradeoffs in the design. The new design kept the same research questions and interventions, but shifted them in time, respecting the order of treatments, but also taking into account importance of seasonality, potential measurement error over time, comparison with previous data and budget limits. The first part of the study remained the same, but took place in the second part of the harvest season (January-April 2013). The second part of the study, focusing on willingness to pay for private treatment and insurance against malaria, took place in the second part of the next harvest season, namely January-April 2014. This was at the same time in the harvest season as originally planned, but one year later. Having completed the field work successfully we are still in the progress of analysing the data.


Research findings 
The preliminary findings for the two main research questions are as follows:
1. Alternative Productivity Measures and Replication Results: This study extends previous work on the impact of a malaria testing and treatment program by replicating a study design previously reported in Akogun et al. (2014). We find similar earnings effects of the malaria testing and treatment program on workers who tested positive (7 percent increase in earnings due to treatment) as in previous rounds, yet the statistical precision of these estimates suffers due to an unforeseen closure on the plantation during the study period which limited the number of worker-week observations. During the same study period, alternative measures of productivity using physical activity monitoring were collected for a worker subsample. Treatment effects on the treated using measures of physical activity indicated that workers daily average time sedentary reduced by forty minutes and time in light physical activity and average physical activity levels increased for the average treated worker by 31 and 32 minutes, respectively. A composite measure of physical activity is also statistically significant at the 5% level despite the reduced sample size. These results suggest that alternative productivity measures such as physical activity illustrate an important mechanism through which malaria treatment affects labor productivity and earnings. 

2. Provision of Malaria Insurance: Our data confirms that workers' willingness to pay for the type of health insurance on offer is modest, but also shows substantial variation. Demand is price sensitive with an estimated elasticity of -0.25. Workers with more experience with and exposure to malaria health care tend to have higher willingness to pay, as do workers who have more accurate knowledge of the treatment of malaria (but not about symptoms or prevention). Those with higher general trust are also willing to pay more. We find little evidence for workers' risk preferences playing a role. For those who gained access to the insurance, we investigate the correlates of use of the service, and find, that apart from exposure and past experience, education, trust and self-assessed health also play a role. We then estimate the effect of health insurance on worker productivity, using the price draw as an instrument, and find that especially those with low willingness to pay benefit considerably from access to insurance, as it increases their income with roughly 10%, primarily through increases in daily productivity. Preliminary findings also indicate that for those who have gained access to the health insurance, use of the health care covered has strong effects on income, in particular through its effects on labor supply, but not productivity

? The conference resulted in two articles in national newspapers in Nigeria, namely the Nigeria Sunrise (7 July 2014) and the Daily Independent Lagos (17 July 2014). 
? The conference was also linked to a blog 'How malaria testing can get more people back into work' at the conversation (https://theconversation.com/how-malaria-testing-can-get-more-people-back-into-work-32067)
? We had several feedback meetings with the plantation management, who has shown and active interest to continue and extend this work. 
? Dissemination of the research include a range of presentations 

2. Draft papers
Based on the existing data analysis, two draft papers have been written, containing the main preliminary findings addressing the two research questions. 
? Agricultural Worker Productivity and Malaria: Alternative Productivity Measures using Physical Activity
? Agricultural workers' willingness to pay for malaria insurance at the workplace. Experimental evidence from Nigeria.


3. Data and documentation
Data and documentation will be completed after finishing the analysis. 

4. Further data analysis and use by students and researchers 

The existing data was further analysed by two students who choose this topic for their dissertation for the Masters of Science in Development Economics at the University of East Anglia; both were supervised by one of the PIs.
? Alix Clark, 2014, Alcohol Consumption and Agrarian Labour Outcomes in Rural Nigeria: A study of sugarcane cutters. The results show alcohol consumption has a significant negative association with earnings as a consequence of its negative association with productivity. It also highlights the moderating effect of religion and ethnicity among these workers. Analysis of payday alcohol consumption suggests that heavy episodic drinking is negatively associated to labour supply the following day.
? Alasdair Makintosh, 2014, The Effect of Nutrition on Productivity and Morbidity on Nigerian Sugarcane Cutters. This paper investigates the effect of nutrition on labour outcomes, more specifically, the non-linear effect of changes in Body Mass Index on labour productivity and morbidity. The study finds that although nutrition has a negligible effect on the productivity of workers within this sample, a significant and robust relationship exists between nutrition and morbidity. 
? Ashesh Prasann, who has been a RA on this project, is further analysing the data as part of his PhD dissertation at MSU, and is supervised by one of the PIs. He is a co-author on the first output paper for this grant and will develop one other extension using the data for his PhD dissertation
? Sani Njobdi, who has been a field manager for this study, is exploring to analyse the data as part of a PhD dissertation at Modibbo Adama University of Technology, supervised by the one of the PIs</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results have broad implications for emerging research literature on health insurance and service delivery in developing countries. These results also underscore the importance of understanding mechanisms through which we presume programs have effects on earnings. By measuring physical activity, we trace the mechanism through which we presume curative malaria treatments affect worker productivity. This can be taken forward in future work by encouraging alternative measures of productivity measurement. 

More specifically the study has 4 knowledge contributions on which future work is expected to build: First, new methods allow estimation of causal effects of health on worker income. Existing work suffers from shortcomings, including omitted variables, simultaneity, reverse causality and poor measurement of ill health and productivity. This study provides a way to address these. A second innovation is the measurement of physical activity, and its identification as a pathway through which treatment works; this also allows inference for other occupations. The World Bank has shown an interest in adopting this method. A third innovation is the offer of a workplace based insurance and study of its impact. There is very limited understanding of the failure in demand for health care and insurance in rural areas, let alone its impact on income. Finally, the results highlight the usefulness of a workplace based approach and involvement of the private sector. National Malaria programme has invited us to further discuss. The plantation has also communicated a strong interest in sustained collaboration.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FCF8B862-3E00-4170-A479-58D73B8C416E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://theconversation.com/how-malaria-testing-can-get-more-people-back-into-work-32067</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is the set of data collected in 2013 and 2014 as described in our two working papers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5859673-08A6-4D43-8481-E5287F2A9C3A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have just finalized the research databases to produce are own research papers and are beginning to share the data with graduate students.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Malaria and Labor Productivity Datasets</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/817B7147-72EF-420A-B9C6-1B5C993B41FB"><gtr:id>817B7147-72EF-420A-B9C6-1B5C993B41FB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Agricultural workers' willingness to pay for malaria insurance at the workplace.
