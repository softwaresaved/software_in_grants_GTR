The ability to tag proteins with fluorescent molecules enables the determination, with microscopy, of the locations of different proteins in the cell. The spatial 'co-localisation' of these proteins can then provide valuable information about how they interact. Although this approach is enormously successful, the use of fluorescence does present a number of inherent problems. We aim to investigate another spectroscopic imaging technique, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) imaging, as an alternative to fluorescence microscopy which offers the potential to overcome these problems. CARS is a non-linear optical technique which allows the measurement of strong vibrational signals, of similar strength to fluorescence. In particular, we will implement Broadband-CARS, in which a CARS spectrum can be measured at each scan point, as the sample of interest is scanned through a tightly focussed laser spot. We will consider the use of conventional small fluorescent molecules as CARS labels, each with a well defined CARS spectrum. We will also apply numerical algorithms (principle components analysis) to separate CARS spectra into the constituent spectra from different labels. This will allow the simultaneous determination at each scan point of the local concentration of a number of labels, for multiplexed protein co-localisation assays. We will perform preliminary measurements on fixed cells and tissue sections, to assess the capabilities of the technique for further application with our biological collaborators and for further development of the technique, towards in vivo imaging.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Optical imaging techniques are particularly attractive for the investigation of protein interactions and dynamics in a cellular context, because they are minimally invasive and can be applied to live cells. In particular, the use of fluorescence microscopy for the determination of protein co-localisation is a now well-established and powerful experimental tool. However, the use of fluorescence presents a number of inherent problems: fluorescence photo-bleaching; sample autofluorescence; cross-talk; bleed-through; and the need to excite different fluorophores with different wavelengths. We aim to investigate coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) imaging as an alternative technique to fluorescence microscopy, offering low photo-bleaching and avoidance of sample autofluorescence with all the advantages of optical imaging retained. CARS is a non-linear optical technique which allows the measurement of strong vibrational signals, of similar strength to fluorescence. In particular, we will implement Broadband-CARS, in which the probe Stokes beam is a supercontinuum excited from a photonic crystal fibre, such that CARS spectra can then be measured at each scan point to enable multiplexed measurement. We will consider the use of conventional small molecule fluorescent probes as CARS labels, each with a well defined CARS spectrum. This, in combination with principle components analysis (PCA), will allow the simultaneous quantitative determination of the local concentration of a number of labels, for protein co-localisation assays. We will perform preliminary measurements on fixed cells and tissue sections, to assess the capabilities of the technique for further application with our biological collaborators and for further development of the technique, towards in vivo imaging.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73159</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The principal impact which has emerged from this research was the development of a a simple and robust optical way of acquiring spontaneous Raman spectra with the speed and sensitivity of CARS, enabling fast optical imaging with chemical contrast.

In particular, resonant CARS signals have a real and imaginary component. The imaginary component is directly related to the spontaneous Raman spectrum, for which there are already large spectral databases to allow chemical identification. The NRB signal, on the other hand, only has a real component. Within embodiments of the invention we recover the imaginary component of the entire CARS signal by simultaneously generating two CARS signals at orthogonal polarisations: one has the imaginary components destructively interfering with (i.e. subtracted from) the real components, the other has them constructively interfering. Measuring these two polarisations and subtracting them therefore cancels out the real part of the signal, leaving only the imaginary components.</gtr:description><gtr:id>807F091F-85B9-4C56-949E-FDF599495D3D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:patentId>WO2012017201</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent granted</gtr:protection><gtr:title>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR NON-RESONANT BACKGROUND REDUCTION IN COHERENT ANTI-STOKES RAMAN SCATTERING (CARS) SPECTROSCOPY</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2012</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a broadband scanning coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscope for multiplexed imaging of cells and tissue, achieved employing a commercially available supercontinuum source. Associated benefits of the approach employed include: (a) reduced cost for implementation of CARS, offering the potential to make CARS imaging more widely accessible to the biology community; (b) reduced risk of photodamage through the use of a near-infra-red pump beam (1060 nm).

We have developed Principal Component Analaysis (PCA) and unspervised Pearson clustering routines to analyse CARS spectra. Due to the coherent nature of the CARS interaction, signals are generated coherently with a non-resonant background, and as such it is important to have spectral decomposition methods that are robust to this. 

We have demonstrated simultaneous CARS imaging for different &amp;quot;vibraphores&amp;quot;, using spectral CARS imaging combined with unsupervised Pearson clustering to distinguish between different vibraphores in the Raman fingerprint region, where molecular specific information is greatest.

We have devised a simple, single-shot heterodyne method to remove non-resonant background from CARS signals, important for the detection of weak Raman modes in multicomponent media.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have been taking the work forward through institutional funding, which led to the development of the patent linked to this grant.
