The pursuit of this goal means that it now costs almost 0.5 billion to produce each new drug, and the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most tightly regulated and one where the costs of withdrawing drugs from the market can be severely damaging to even the biggest companies. One of the major determinants of drug safety and efficacy is how the body handles these chemicals, and the human body has evolved an effective but highly complex chemical defence system for protecting itself against the potentially harmful effects of the myriad of drugs and other chemicals to which we are exposed from our diet and environment. This system comprises several hundred enzymes and other proteins that act on these chemicals to limit their potency and facilitate their safe and timely removal from the body. One of the most important enzyme families in our chemical defence armoury are the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), and some 70-80% of all drugs leave the body after being acted on by UGTs. Humans have 17 different members of the UGT family, 4 of which are particularly important in drug handling. The UGT enzymes can add a molecule of glucuronic acid onto many thousands of chemicals, making them more soluble and helping their excretion from the body. Paradoxically, these glucuronides can themselves occasionally exhibit pharmacological or toxic properties, and understanding how drugs are metabolised by enzymes such as the UGTs in the body and the properties of the products of these biotransformation reactions are important parts of the approval processes for new drugs. It is therefore extremely important for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to be able to produce these glucuronides synthetically; however chemical synthesis of such glucuronides is technically difficult and very expensive. This project aims to develop biological, as opposed to chemical, strategies for synthesising glucuronides of drugs. These biocatalysts will be evolved from both microbial and human genes, and the focus of the University of Dundee team's effort in this project will be to design human UGTs to introduce into the bacterium E. coli. The aims of the project are: To convert the genes for 4 human UGTs involved in the glucuronidation of many drugs into a form that can be readily introduced into bacteria / i.e. to create designer UGT genes . To introduce these UGTs into appropriate strain(s) of E. coli, and to determine that the bacteria produce the enzymes and that they are active. To also introduce the enzyme (called UDP-glucose dehydrogenase) that makes the essential co-factor (that donates the glucuronic acid) for the glucuronidation reaction into the bacteria, thereby creating glucuronide factories . To demonstrate that these bacterial glucuronide factories can produce appropriate amounts of glucuronides of common drugs. The work will produce a valuable set of reagents that is likely to be of enormous value to the pharmaceutical industry since it will provide the ability to biosynthesise glucuronides of development compounds from an endlessly renewable and comparatively inexpensive source. Access to such metabolites is essential for supporting the development and eventual licensing of novel small molecule therapeutic drugs. Commercialisation of the output from this project will be a priority for both the lead partner (Novacta) and the University of Dundee.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288978</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">DT/E011063/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9C387DA5-CD5F-43E4-AA74-82CBF4DB6617</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioprocess Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
