Currently, there is great interest in nanotechnology, the science of constructing and studying objects at nanometre scales (a billionth of a metre). Research in this area has shown that when materials are reduced down to this size scale, or have alterations to their shape at this length, entirely new properties can arise that are radically different from when they exist in a bulk form. By finding ways of harnessing these unusual properties, new technologies can be developed for improved electronic devices, medical tools and even construction materials. However, the development of convenient methods for assembling structurally and chemically complex surfaces with such nanometre control remains a formidable challenge.

One possible means of addressing this issue is to combine two powerful methods of generating nano-scale objects: The first uses an instrument called a &amp;quot;scanning probe microscope&amp;quot;, which employs miniature electrical motors to move a very sharp tip, the &amp;quot;probe&amp;quot; of the instrument that is only a few nanometres wide. The instrument is also able to control the movement of this probe with nanometre precision. This ability to move and position the probe with such fine control makes it possible to use it to &amp;quot;write&amp;quot; patterns on surfaces. Together with this method is the use of specially designed &amp;quot;block copolymers&amp;quot;, which are a type of plastic material where different parts of the polymer molecule have different physical properties. Since the different portions of the polymer molecule interact with their surroundings and other polymer molecules in different ways, they separate themselves out into microscopic and nanoscopic structures. For example, the way oil droplets separate from water is due to the fact that the oil molecules prefer to associate with other oil molecules rather than water molecules. Thus, by using a scanning probe to deposit block copolymers, it will be possible to generate extremely small droplet-like structures on surfaces, which would be even smaller than could normally be produced by standard scanning probe methods alone.

This travel grant will allow Dr. L. S. Wong to visit Northeastern University in Boston, USA, to work with Prof. K. Zhang, an expert polymer chemist and develop new methods that combine these two otherwise disparate areas of research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This travel grant will help lay the foundations towards a collaboration into an enhanced nanolithographic technique. This technique would enable the deposition of a variety of polymers with nanoscale resolution, leading to the templating and synthesis of a wide range of inorganic nanoparticles. The generic nature of this capability means this technique would be relevant to many areas.

As noted in the &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; section, this travel grant would benefit the wider scientific community by promoting increased international academic networking, collaborative working and crossdisciplinary research. Although this grant is intended to establish joint research in nanofabrication and polymer chemistry, wider interactions will include parties involved in surface science, catalysis (inorganic and biological), metamaterials and biomaterials. Applications in these wider research areas could in the longer term lead to applications in new catalytic surfaces for chemical processing and manufacture, new highly miniaturised electronic devices and biocompatible materials for medical implants.

Overall, this travel grant will contribute to the UK's position as a major participant in the field of nanotechnology by enabling its incorporation into other scientific disciplines. Participation in this research will cultivate a new generation of scientists and enable the UK to better harness the potential economic and social benefits arising from this area. This is particularly timely since nanotechnology is now at the cusp of transitioning from fundamental research to tangible applications with socio-economic impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5786</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D3277CE4-0595-4466-AFA8-1DA114CA0615"><gtr:id>D3277CE4-0595-4466-AFA8-1DA114CA0615</gtr:id><gtr:title>Enzyme-compatible, high-throughput, and quantitative spectrophotometric assays for arylamine halogenations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bc86d250169679f7ecf04b09ba6d6a18"><gtr:id>bc86d250169679f7ecf04b09ba6d6a18</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hosford Joseph</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0065-7727</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L005417/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
