This is principally due to the wasting of skeletal muscle (a process called &amp;quot;sarcopenia&amp;quot;). Skeletal muscle wasting occurs not only with older age but also with a large number of common illnesses: trauma, burn injury, diabetes, cancer, heart failure, renal failure, Alzheimer's disease, and arthritis (to name but a few). Crucially, in these cases, muscle wasting is more than just a symptom of weakness and poor functional capacity. Muscle wasting exposes us to an increased risk of falls and fractures, which often lead to death within a year in the aged. Thus, muscle wasting occurring in disease and with age impacts on quality of life, independence, morbidity and mortality and represents a major UK health problem. However, we currently understand little about the processes that regulate sarcopenia in humans. The best-known means by which to counter muscle wasting occurring in older age is exercise. For example, if one were to look at a body builder they would notice the gross musculature gained (called &amp;quot;hypertrophy&amp;quot;) from lifting weights. While muscle growth on this scale is not possible in older age, a degree of muscle growth and functional improvement can be achieved. Finding optimal exercise strategies with which to counteract sarcopenia is therefore an important goal.

In the current proposal we have developed a novel strategy to explore human sarcopenia and exercise strategies with which to offset it. We have recently found that sarcopenia manifests in two &amp;quot;spatially&amp;quot; different ways. Sarcopenic muscles display wasting due to reductions both in muscle &amp;quot;length &amp;quot; at the muscle end, and muscle &amp;quot;width&amp;quot; along the mid-section. Therefore, our first goal is to study older and younger people over a period of 2 months to define the process(es) responsible for loss of muscle length AND width in sarcopenia. To achieve this we will provide young and older volunteers with daily drinks of &amp;quot;labelled water&amp;quot; from which we will be able to track longitudinal changes in important aspects in the building processes of muscle (by taking intermittent muscle samples from the muscle middle and end) over this entire period. This approach will explain why human sarcopenia is spatially distinct.

Secondly, we propose to assess excercise interventions for reversing human sarcopenia. Conventional resistance exercise is composed of both lengthening and shortening muscle contractions (touch your shoulder and imagine lowering down a dumbbell (lengthening) and then lifting it again (shortening). Intriguingly, when exposing individuals to either exclusive lengthening or shortening exercise training we have found that lengthening exercise increases muscle length and shortening exercise increases muscle width. Herein we propose to trial the efficacy of lengthening and shortening contractions in counteracting spatial differences we have identified in sarcopenia while also studying the mechanisms underlying why these contractions work the way they do. To achieve this we will provide young and older volunteers with daily drinks of &amp;quot;labelled water&amp;quot; during either lengthening or shortening contraction training after which we will be able to track longitudinal changes in important aspects in the building processes of muscle (by taking intermittent muscle samples from the muscle middle and end) over this entire period in youth and ageing.

This project will have significant, perhaps groundbreaking, implications for our understanding of the control of skeletal muscle size in humans, particularly in relation to the problem of sarcopenia.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to take a human systems physiology approach that couples whole body functional, whole tissue anatomic, and sub-cellular molecular and metabolic measures to address the molecular basis of sarcopenia, the molecular basis of exercise induced muscle growth, and optimal strategies with which to use exercise to counteract sarcopenia. We have shown that sarcopenia (viewed by DXA/ MRI) is due to specific architectural changes on an individual muscle level, viz: loss of sarcomeres in series and sarcomeres in parallel (by ultrasound). To determine the basis of these changes, we will sample tissue at the muscle mid-belly (loss of sarcomeres in parallel) and close to the distal aponeurosis (loss of sarcomeres in series). Using a new tracer (D2O) approach we will measuring turnover of muscle sub-fractions (e.g. myofibrils, myoplasm, mitochondria, nuclei [satellite cells]) and correlate these with standard measures of anabolic signalling (e.g. detection of phosphorylation events in these pathways). Data from these measures will then be correlated with tissue level changes and defined by comparison to a younger group to seek age x spatial architecture/ spatial metabolic differences such to identify the dynamic metabolic underlying sarcopenia. Next, we will determine the longitudinal and spatially distinct alterations in architecture, signalling, and metabolism (as above) in response to concentric (CON) vs. eccentric (ECC) contraction by comparison to a young population to seek contraction x age x spatial architecture/ spatial metabolic differences. This will inform on (i) dynamic processes regulating distinct spatial adaptations to ECC/CON and (ii) the efficacy of ECC vs. CON in reversing spatially distinct aspects of sarcopenia. Lastly, we will measure the effect of ECC vs. CON in functional terms (e.g. strength gains, improved gait, improved balance, etc.) to determine if ECC or CON is more effective at combating the functional consequences of sarcopenia.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to academic beneficiaries we believe this work will benefit, the wider public, the commercial private sector, charities, and the staff working on the project. Academic beneficiaries will be the wider muscle community as we will provide innovative knowledge on the mechanisms of muscle growth in response to different modalities of mechanical loading, the causes of the blunted anabolic response to resistive training in old age, and proof of concept of the efficacy of repeated, submaximal muscular exercise for combating sarcopenia and weakness in old age. Additionally, we will develop a new resource for use by other scientists in the field. Our muscle protein synthesis (MPS) determination by D2O method provides an unprecedented method for studying the temporal and sub-cellular variations in muscle protein metabolism based on chronic rate determinations of MP; many groups will likely use this approach for mechanistic research into hypertrophy and sarcopenia. The wider public will benefit from this work in the form of improved diagnosis and treatment of sarcopenia, ultimately (it is hoped) decreasing public healthcare expenditure. We will directly examine the type, modality and impact of muscle loading exercise regime most efficacious for treating sarcopenia. Within 3-5 years this could reduce the public healthcare expenditure for conditions associated with declining muscle health (for example in this case the aged) though reducing economic burden of sarcopenia and perhaps to wider prevalent conditions associated with muscle atrophy i.e. cancer, type II Diabetes. Even more broadly all sectors of the UK could benefit from increased productivity as the result of decreased loss of work days due to muscle problems. Importantly, as we are members of a new MRC/Arthritis Research UK Centre for Musculoskeletal Ageing Research we are uniquely positioned to conduct BBSRC funded basic research and interact with those engaged in seeking treatments for the decline of muscle with age. If exercise proves effective, we can therefore start the translational process as soon as the end of the second year of this project and demonstrate true cross council prioritization of muscle aging research. The commercial private sector will benefit in the development and commercialisation of innovative training contraptions targeted at restoring muscle mass of older individuals. These impacts will be felt within the third year as we present and publish our results of these exercise interventions. Charities will also benefit in much the same way, particularly those charities that support increased quality of life in individuals with problems that involve musculoskeletal frailty, loss of mobility and increased risk of falls (for example: Research into Aging) and Arthritis Research UK who is committed to reducing decline of the entire musculoskeletal system with age. Lastly, the staff working on this project will benefit in two ways. The post-doctoral researcher will gain training in in vivo protein metabolism assessment using this innovative D2O methodology, molecular biology, muscle ultrasound and muscle function, and in the physiological awareness of sarcopenia. The appointed technician will gain unique experience running this new method of assessment of human protein synthesis, thereby strengthen his/her skill-set. Both of these types of professional development will aid in their ability to seek further employment, with additional training in project management being the most transferable skill they will continue to develop. These impacts will be felt within the first year and fully realized in 2-4 years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>479644</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Open Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D7586226-BEBA-4331-A15E-B01EE4D98869</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the public (including children), students, patient groups and volunteers were invited to the medical school to see the range of research activities that were ongoing.

Now we report the following results:
1) Comparison of muscle morphological (muscle architecture, muscle mass) and functional characteristics (muscle strength, activation capacity, rate of torque development) of the young (YM) and older (OM) male cohorts
2) Comparison of the tendon mechanical properties (tendon stiffness and Young's Modulus) of the YM and OM cohorts and their role, together with neural drive and muscle size, to the speed of force development in the YM and OM cohorts.
3) Comparison of the time-course of the morphological adaptations of the YM and OM participants to 8-week resistive exercise training programme based on either shortening contractions (concentric, CON) or lengthening contractions (eccentric, ECC).
4) Temporal response and mechanisms of muscle protein and collagen synthesis to different modes of exercise in YM vs OM

Results 
1) Muscle architecture, muscle volume and muscle function of YM and OM
OM demonstrated a 32% lower isometric MVC ('static maximum contraction force') and a 25% smaller quadriceps muscle CSA compared to YM. Quadriceps voluntary activation (AC) during maximal leg extension was 4% lower in OM than in YM, and muscle twitch CT was 21% longer in OM . Also, the rate of motor unit recruitment (rate of EMG development) was significantly 42% slower in OM than in YM. Absolute RTD was 34.5% lower in OM. The age-related reduction in RTD was maintained after normalization of RTD to peak CSA (nRTD).

2) Tendon mechanical properties and related functional outcomes
Patellar tendon dimensions (CSA and length) of YM and OM respectively were found to be unaffected by age. Patellar tendon stiffness was found to be 31% lower in OM. Young's modulus demonstrated the same trend as stiffness. No differences in either fascicle length or in resting fascicle: tendon ratio were detected. 
RTD correlated with AC, rate of EMG development, CSA, MVC and tendon stiffness. However, nRTD was found to be significantly correlated with tendon stiffness and MVC.

These observations provide evidence that in absolute terms, a lower RTD in the elderly is caused by a slower muscle contraction speed, slower TTPE, a reduction in muscle CSA and a decrease in tendon stiffness. Significantly, however, the only variable to remain correlated once the RTD is normalized to quad CSA, is tendon stiffness. This strongly reinforces the importance of both muscle and tendon characteristics when considering RTD, but especially the stiffness of the tendon. This has implications for the design of interventions aiming at improving postural stability and preventing falls in older people.

3) Time-course of the morphological adaptations to resistive training (RT) of YM and OM 
Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 YM, 19-30 yrs, and 12 OM, 65-73 yrs) were recruited for this investigation. YM and OM were randomly assigned to either an ECC (n=6) or CON (n=6) RT group: volunteers were trained 3 times/wk for 8 weeks (12-15 reps x 4 sets) at the 60% of either the ECC or CON 1RM. Changes in vastus lateralis (VL) architecture (fascicle length -Lf, and pennation angle - PA) were assessed by ultrasound technique. Quadriceps mid-thigh (50% of VL length) cross sectional area (CSA) was measured by extended field of view (EFOV) ultrasound technique. The data acquisition was performed at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of the training regime.
Contraction-specific responses in muscle architecture were found with RT: 
i) a preferential increase in Lf was found after ECC, while PA showed greater increase after CON RT. 
ii) YM ECC group showed a faster and greater increase in Lf compared to the ECC OM group since 2 weeks from the start of the protocol (+2.84%) which was maintained at 4,6 and 8wks. 
iii) CSA showed similar increase and time course pattern with both loading types (ECC or CON) across ages (YM vs. OM): however, in OM, ECC presented a greater CSA increase at 4 and 6 wks compared to CON. 

These findings show that structural changes are achieved earlier and in a greater manner by moderate-load ECC in YM compared to OM. In OM, the more rapid increase in muscle CSA in response to ECC indicates that moderate-load ECC exercise could be a more time-efficient hypertrophic stimulus than moderate CON RT.

4) Temporal response and mechanisms of muscle protein and collagen synthesis to different modes of exercise in YM vs OM
Progress with regard to the synthesis measures of muscle and tendon has been hampered by significant technical issues with the Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer that makes the very sensitive measures of deuterated Alanine incorporation into muscle protein and tendon collagen. So, at this point we have been unable to compare the effect of the different modes of exercise on protein turnover in these tissues. The muscle samples have been extracted and prepped ready for analysis and some method development work on some of the Tendon samples has demonstrated quite clearly via the incorporation of deuterated Alanine in collagen extracted from Tendon, that we can measure the rate of incorporation of label into Tendon, albeit the rate of turnover is markedly less than muscle myofibrillar protein - in line with data from the literature from acute measures.
With regard to the technical issues this required significant input from the instrument vendor over a protracted period of time (approx. 12 months), but we now believe we have identified a build-up of material in capillaries leading from the reactor (the reactor is set at 1400oC and is responsible for generating the H2 gas from the Alanine) which ultimately back up into the reactor causing a dilution of the deuterium labelling in subsequent samples leading to significant dilution of the label and underestimation of the incorporation rate (synthesis). Such is our confidence that we have overcome this issue that we have acquired a second instrument to make these measurements ensuring we can double throughput and capacity (we have many studies involving D2O that are ongoing and in planning - we have 2 grants from the Dunhill Medical Trust and Industry funding that will use this approach) importantly the acquisition of this new mass spectrometer will reduce the back-log of samples that have built up over the last 12 months. We anticipate completing the Muscle synthesis and Tendon collagen synthesis measures from this study over the next 6 months.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS:

1) Formulation of new exercise protocols aimed at improving muscle mass in young and older populations in health and disease.

2) Novel information on the morphological adaptations of human skeletal muscle to eccentric (lengthening) and concentric (shortening) loading excercise and how these are affected by age
3) Novel information on regional differences in human skeletal muscle morphological and molecular responses to eccentric and concentric resistive exercise.
4) New insights into the mechanisms of muscle ageing and muscle hypertrophy in response to different loading modes.
5) Elderly tendons are less stiff (i.e. more easy to stretch) than young tendons and this seems to account for the slower rate of force development during rapid contractions. This observation may have important implications for the avoidance of fall in the elderly as rapid force development. This is essential for fast transmission of force generated by the muscle to bones, enabling a quick counteraction, as needed when tripping over an object.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>956E7572-5677-41B2-8F7B-E336156198D1</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Electronics,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Our group will host the ESPEN international tracer course on metabolism - this will impact researchers stable isotope technology applications</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90F202C6-0F8A-4DDF-9AC9-E9A99B20C12D</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://icu-metabolism.se/onewebmedia/CTMM2016_Flyer%202.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>The use of muscle ultrasound to quantify mass and as a clinical diagnostic for low muscle mass (comparing MRI).

A new ultrasound-based research tool has been developed for the assessment of muscle cross-sectional area through the use of extended-field of view (EFOV) ultrasound. This method enables to perform a tomographic scan of the muscle in the axial (transverse) plane and obtain a cross-sectional image of the muscle investigated. The technique was tested against MRI and found to be highly correlated.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4779CBB6-47B2-41FA-A237-29CB2BE28721</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several research groups in our medical school are now using the above two techniques in current research studies, including undergraduate and postgraduate research student projects.
