aim to test the effects of mobile phone based smoking cessation support on self reported smoking status verified using a biochemical test on a sample of saliva at six months. Smoking contributes to the death of one in two of those who continue to smoke past 35 years of age. 
Mobile phones allow personalised smoking cessation support programmes to be delivered inexpensively wherever the person is located. The New Zealand STOMP (stop smoking with mobile phones) trial found a doubling in quit rates at six weeks but provided no reliable data on long term effects. 
The Txt2stop intervention is based on the STOMP programme, modified for use in the UK. To modify the intervention, youth smoking cessation counsellors and 62 potential participants reviewed all text messages in a series of focus groups. We have already conducted a pilot study among 200 participants. We achieved 93% long term follow up. The short term results show a doubling of quit rate (24% vs. 10%). 
The Txt2stop trial among 5800 participants will establish the impact of mobile phone based smoking cessation support.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: Most of those killed by tobacco started smoking as teenagers and smoking kills one in two of those who continue to smoke past 35 years of age. Over half of young smokers want to quit or cut down but there is no evidence of the long term efficacy of smoking-cessation interventions in young people. Mobile phones provide a new channel for individualised programmes to be delivered inexpensively wherever the person is located and are popular with young people. The STOMP (stop smoking with mobile phones) trial assessed the effectiveness of a text message-based smoking cessation intervention in New Zealand. The results show considerable promise, with a two-fold increase in reported quit rates at 6 weeks. However, limitations in this study compromised the validity of the results at 6 months. 
Drawing on the input of youth smoking cessation counsellors, cognitive behavioural therapists, motivational interviewing trained smoking cessation counsellors and 62 potential participants who reviewed all text messages in a series of focus groups, we modified the STOMP intervention for the UK. A pilot RCT which addressed the limitations of the previous study has been conducted with 200 participants. We recruited the target of 200 participants within two weeks from the trial launch. We achieved 98% complete short term follow up. The early results show a doubling of quit rate (24% vs. 10%). The long term outcome response rate is currently 93% with data collection still ongoing. The Txt2stop trial is needed to provide robust information on the long-term effectiveness of text messaging smoking cessation support. 

Aim: To reliably assess whether a package of mobile phone based support can improve smoking cessation rates at 6 months. 

Methods: We will conduct a single-blind randomised controlled trial of the Txt2stop mobile phone based smoking cessation intervention. 5,400 participants aged 16 and over will be randomised to the intervention or control group by computer. The primary outcome is self-reported abstinence at 6 months, verified by salivary cotinine testing. All analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. The difference between the proportions that have quit at different stages of follow-up will be assessed using the chi-square statistic, with estimation of relative risks, 95% confidence intervals and two-sided p-values. 

Implications: If successful, the study will provide robust evidence of the long term effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention delivered by mobile phone. This will have major public health implications for tobacco related mortality and morbidity.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1697873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>QUIT (Smoking Cessation Charity)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Communications for trial recruitment</gtr:description><gtr:id>67F1C647-1B7C-4AB7-9676-9B15AED6ACEC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The trial fully recruited on time</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The QUIT communications team designed and delivered the initial communications strategy to promote the txt2stop trial.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We evaluated the impact of communications and adverts and used this to develope the ongoing communications strategy regarding the trial</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute for Health Innovation (NIHI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>New Zealand</gtr:country><gtr:department>Clinical Trials Research Unit</gtr:department><gtr:description>The IT to deliver the intervention</gtr:description><gtr:id>52EA725E-37E0-4FD3-9952-79A3EA6934FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The IT and accompanying system specifications to deliver the txt2stop intervention</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The CTRU developed the original IT to deliver the txt2stop intervention .

If these 47,000 people have the same benefits as smokers in the trial and based on the trial cost effectiveness analysis the smokers recruited to date will benefit from over 790 life years saved, 1,270 QALY gained.

By Following the publication of the paper in The Lancet in 2011, the Tobacco Control Marketing Team for the Department of Health (DH) in England approached Free to help them develop a new text messaging service. Free advised the DH regarding the text message content for the intervention and provided extensive feedback on the messages written. She also gave advice regarding the design of the intervention covering the delivery system requirements, message frequency and the interactive features required. The service was made available free at the point of delivery from the NHS Stop Smoking website in January 2012. By the end of March 2013, over 34,000 smokers had joined the programme. The services is still available via the NHS smokefree website. 


As the intervention is highly cost effective and more cost effective than other smoking cessation treatments this will have increased the efficiency and effectivness of service delivery. 

In the USA, Agile Health - a commercial provider of mobile health care engagement solutions - based their Kick Buts programme, launched in 2012, on the LSHTM and STOMP trials.5.9 A technologically improved version, Kick Buts 2.0, offering Facebook integration and a Spanish language version among other things, was launched in January 2013. By the middle of 2013, 1,000 people had signed up to Kick Buts.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>WHO initiative for M-health for tobacco control</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B77D3F2-05F4-4DEC-AD59-B05B46E664EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>WHO used the txt2stop campaign in a presentation and panel discussion for member states focused on mHealth (health-related messages delivered by mobile phone) in Geneva in May 2013. The event was hosted by Costa Rica, which in April 2013 had become the first to roll out its own equivalent of the txt2stop campaign. At least 175 delegates from WHO member states, civil society, private sector representatives and the media attended. WHO invited Free to be a member of the WHO informal working group on m-cessation in recognition of her 'leadership and experience in m-cessation'. 
 India launched its smoking cessation support delivered by text message service nationally in Jan 2015. Over 170,000 people joined the service in the first 10 days of its launch. The Phillipines and Tunisia are implementing national programmes with WHO during 2016.
