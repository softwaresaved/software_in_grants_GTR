Population aging increases the public-health burden of age-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and dementia. It is now known that the pathogenesis of such age related diseases involves gradually accumulating damage to organ systems, beginning in the first half of the life course, particularly in people exposed to early-life adversity. It is also known that age-related diseases and early mortality are portended by a variety of adverse experiences in early life. Although these facts imply that it is desirable to prevent early-life adversities, adversity cannot be fully prevented (and it is too late to prevent early life adversity for the baby-boomer generation). Therefore there is growing interest in interventions for midlife adults, to reverse the damage done by early-life adversity. This interest lends new scientific significance to existing studies that have followed cohorts from childhood to midlife, because they can provide an evidence base to inform and speed the development of novel intervention strategies. The RFA extends a call for such studies. We propose to undertake data analyses in one such study, the NIA-funded Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health &amp;amp; Development Study, a longitudinal birth-cohort study of both problematic and positive processes of lifelong development. Our data resource comprises in-clinic assessments at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and most recently 38 years, with 95% retention as the cohort enters midlife. The data combine demographic/economic surveys, clinical-quality health assessments, a bio-bank, genome-wide SNP data, and administrative-record linkage. First, we will generate outcome measures to detect individual differences in
decline of biomarkers for organ systems in the general population at early midlife, the stage when future reversibility interventions will be applied. Second, we will compare the performance of retrospective versus prospective measures of early-life adversity. Future reversibility interventions will have to rely on midlife participants' retrospective reports of adversity, so there is a need to know how well this is going to work. Third, we will test how the connection between early-life adversity and midlife aging relates to polygenic genetic risk and family history of age-related diseases. Will genotype or family history influence responsiveness to reversibility interventions? Fourth, we will identify potentially reversible behavioral and social factors that mediate the connection from early-life adversity to midlife biological aging. Findings are expected to support the design of future randomized clinical trials of midlife interventions intended to reverse the effects of early-life adversity, prevent age-related diseases, and enhance wellbeing in late life.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>n/a</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147089</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>School of Medicine Otago</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>New Zealand</gtr:country><gtr:department>Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health &amp; Development Research Unit</gtr:department><gtr:description>The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health &amp;amp; Development Study, Otago School of Medicine</gtr:description><gtr:id>BDF7910B-5925-47F4-B94F-54543F3593EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>over 1000 publications</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>the Unit at Otago runs the cohort study and undertakes data-collection waves</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We raised funds and designed protocols and analysed the data</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Duke University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Medicine Duke</gtr:department><gtr:description>Duke University Geriatrics School of Medicine</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D54EE80-3926-4582-9F0E-59DBA189BD4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PNAS publication</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>coauthor papers</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>coauthor papears</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Otago</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>New Zealand</gtr:country><gtr:description>Data sharing from the Dunedin Study</gtr:description><gtr:id>A60E78FF-7535-4ACC-A764-9F6932D07422</gtr:id><gtr:impact>more than 1200 scientific publications since 1973</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Dunedin Study data set is shared among a consortium of 6 research teams, from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and us, in the UK.

We followed 1000 members of a birth cohort while collecting a panel of biomarkers from them every 6 years, and used the repeated measures dataset to create a method to measure how rapidly or slowly any individual is aging. Belsky et al 2015. PNAS
2. We found that intelligence measured in early childhood, middle childhood, and midlife correlated significantly with perceived facial age, the NHANES biomarker algorithm, and Framingham heart age. Correlations between intelligence and telomere length were more modest. Study members with lower intelligence at age three had more advanced biological age at midlife. Schaefer et al 2016, J of Gero. 
3. We tested whether associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; e.g., abuse, neglect, parental loss, etc.) are the same for prospective and retrospective ACE measures in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study. Retrospective and prospective measures of adversity showed only moderate agreement. Retrospective ACEs showed stronger associations with life outcomes that were subjectively assessed, and weaker associations with life outcomes that were objectively assessed. More agreeable and neurotic dispositions bias retrospective ACE measures toward miss-estimating the impact of adversity on health outcomes. Reuben et al. 2016. JCPP
4. We found that individuals exposed to childhood victimization had pervasive impairments in clinically-relevant cognitive functions including general intelligence, executive function, processing speed, memory, perceptual reasoning, and verbal comprehension in adolescence and adulthood. However, the observed cognitive deficits in victimized individuals were largely explained by cognitive deficits that predated childhood victimization and by confounding genetic and environmental risks. Danese et al 2017. AM J of Psychiatry
5. We report that personal-history characteristics of familial longevity, childhood social-class, adverse childhood experiences, and childhood health, intelligence, and self-control all predicted differences in cohort members' adulthood Pace of Aging. Accumulation of more personal-history risks predicted faster Pace of Aging. Belsky et al 2017. in review
6. Our argument is that gero-prevention can best be attained by studying and measuring the pace of aging in young-to-mildlife adults. this argument is summarised in Moffit et al 2017, J of Gero.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our measure of the pace of aging can be used as a sensitive outcome measure in randomised clinical trials of therapies to prevent aging-related disease and disability. It works with people in their twenties to forties, allowing anti-aging therapies to be implemented in young adults before disease onset. 

Because trials of anti-aging therapies will need to ascertain personal histories retrospectively, we replicated results using cohort members' retrospective personal-history reports made in adulthood. Because many trials recruit participants from clinical settings, we replicated results in the cohort subset who had recent health-system contact according to electronic medical records. Quick, inexpensive measures of trial participants' early personal histories can enable clinical trials to study who volunteers for trials, who adheres to treatment, and who responds to anti-aging therapies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>924030AE-6D62-4497-BC98-50C979D3304F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.moffittcaspi.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Adult ADHD paper selected by NEJM as in top 10 findings of psychiatry in 2015</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F07A17C1-2059-466E-B3AC-881B150EA605</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.jwatch.org/na39791/2015/12/28/nejm-journal-watch-psychiatry-top-stories-2015?</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Science News named our paper the 4th best science story of 2015</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FEEFCD40-0629-4A43-AFFA-9F5FC7A88082</gtr:id><gtr:impact>not sure yet</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/top-stories-2015-pluto-gene-editing-new-hominid-and-more</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Prime Mininster's speech, plus Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer 2012, Our Children Deserve Better: Prevention Pays.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B311B89C-7226-4FA3-9F78-B4C712D0B85F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From Jo Jenkinson at the UK MRC: &amp;quot;Your research is everywhere in the public domain at the moment with the Prime Ministers's speech on child and adolescent mental health and the new MQ publicity campaign.
