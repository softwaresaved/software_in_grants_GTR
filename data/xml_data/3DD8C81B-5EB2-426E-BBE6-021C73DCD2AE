Members of the team have extensive experience of community heritage projects and public engagement activities, and this project aims to bring the expertise located within UCL to the attention of a wider audience, deepen existing and establish new partnerships with community groups, explore the benefits of bringing together different branches of community heritage (notably community archives and archaeology) and seeking to encourage the participation of young people in community heritage activities. 

Drawing inspiration from the History Workshop slogan &amp;quot;Dig Where You Stand&amp;quot;, this project is based on the principle that a community's sense of place rests on an understanding of its past. Building on existing initiatives and work in community archaeology, community archives, local history, oral history, public geography, community film and media studies and digital heritage, the researchers on this team share a belief in the profound impact that history and local heritage can have in sustaining communities and enhancing the quality of life of those who participate in heritage activities. They are committed to sharing their knowledge and expertise to develop and sustain broad participation (particularly amongst young people) in a range of community heritage activities. 

This proposal brings together a research team from UCL with community practitioners in public and community archaeology, community archives and other community heritage practices in London and the Home Counties. While such activities are all well represented within UCL, the practitioners of community archives and community archaeology have often not had the opportunity to share examples of best practice or build collaborative projects. This project seeks to make clear the benefits and synergies for community heritage practitioners and researchers of closer collaboration, by accessing the expertise in public engagement and support for community heritage activity in UCL, and by organising a programme of events designed to bring together researchers and community heritage practitioners to stimulate dialogue, the mutual exchange of ideas and knowledge, and build future collaborations.

The development award will enable the team to widen recognition of the community heritage expertise available within UCL (via attendance at the programmed events and the various planned outputs, including an interactive project website (sustained by UCL for three years after the project funding ends), material placed on the community heritage NCCPE site, conference papers at the appropriate community heritage conferences, an article on community heritage collaborations in a peer review journal (the International Journal of Heritage Studies) and practical guidance designed in collaboration with our community partners. The project will also result in the development and extension of new and existing research partnerships with groups doing community heritage, including activities and partnerships supported by further HLF and possible future research council funding. Finally the project aims at establishing and disseminating models for encouraging greater participation by young people in various community heritage activities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research project?

a) Academics in UCL and elsewhere (see academic beneficiaries)
b) Heritage professionals in museums, archives and archaeological societies who will have access to more information about community heritage activities and engaging with community groups, particularly young people with heritage activity.
c) Schools, universities and other organisations working with young people in a framework where they might wish to introduce those young people to heritage activities 
d) Community groups, especially community groups already actively participating (or thinking of doing so) in local or community heritage work 
e) Society in general

How will they benefit from this research project?

This project is all about the exchange of knowledge with community heritage groups and other groups and individuals interested in getting involved in or supporting community heritage activity. It starts from a recognition that although great knowledge and expertise already resides in community heritage practitioner groups, great (and often different) knowledge resides within higher education institutions like UCL. This project seeks to bring together some of that knowledge and expertise from across the disciplines at UCL in order to make it available to those wishing to get involved or are already involved in community activity. This knowledge can be used to address serious problems for the sustainability of community heritage (eg digital preservation) or to develop new practices / approaches (eg community archaeology or digital approaches to creating and sharing community heritage). In some cases this may result in sustained collaborative relationships between the university and community groups. The public events, individual knowledge exchange, web resources and longer term research partnerships should all result in more sustained, rigorous and ultimately more useful and widely accessible community heritage materials.

The events, websites and community engagement models (especially those developed with regard to engaging young people) will be available to all other institutions (schools, museums, archives, social and welfare agencies) who wish to engage with community heritage, and this should again the support the creation of more successful and impactful community heritage projects and collaborations 

In broader terms the members of this project and their partners believe that community heritage and participation in community heritage can have significant impacts on individuals, communities and society in general particularly in terms of culture, understanding and belonging, health and well-being but also in concrete terms of things like employability and the acquisition of useful skills and experience. Community heritage covers a wide range of activities and a wide range of 'communities', ranging from those with a local history focus to those with a focus on a history and heritage organised around an minority or ethnic identity. These different interests and communities will result in different possible impacts, and in our partner organisations (local community archives, local archaeological groups, heritage bodies based on African heritage) we reflect some of that huge diversity. However what is true of all these activities, is the more developed and sustainable they are, they better known they are, the more they can approach their heritage work in an innovative and holistic way through the collaborations with university researchers embedded in this project, then the larger, the more widespread and the more significant their impact is likely to be. This project aims to help community heritage activities achieve those impacts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19832</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>UCL Dig Where We Stand (DWWS) was one of twenty one multidisciplinary university teams nationally funded by the AHRC across the UK to support the community heritage research activities of groups funded by the HLF. In a specially designed stream of funding ('All Our Stories' grants worth &amp;pound;3000-&amp;pound;10,000), the HLF funded some 500 community-based groups to conduct heritage research. The DWWS team included UCL-based researchers from archaeology, archives, history, oral history, cultural heritage, digital humanities, public geography, film studies and museum studies, all united by an interest in community-based heritage and in engaging our disciplines and our research with people outside the university and it was supported in its work by a number of community and heritage based organisations such the Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and the Black Cultural Archives (BCA). The project took its name and inspiration from the Swedish author and activist Sven Lindqvist's influential Gr&amp;auml;v d&amp;auml;r du st&amp;aring;r (Dig Where You Stand, 1978) and his English article of the same title in Oral History (1979). Lindqvist argued that because it was important that workers (and others) should carry out their own research, it was essential for someone to facilitate that processes by providing guidance on the techniques and methods of historical research. He thus produced Dig Where You Stand, '...a handbook which would help others, especially workers to write these factory histories in their own neighbourhoods and their own places of work'. In a similar fashion the UCL DWWS research team aimed to work with HLF-funded groups to enable them to develop and implement their research ideas, offering training in particular research skills where necessary, and encouraging a more holistic approach to community-based heritage research by bringing together the different elements (eg archaeology, archive research, oral history and digital technology). The team were particularly interested in working with projects which sought to encourage greater participation by young people in community heritage activities. Over the two years (2012-2013) DWWS ran a number of events including a Community Heritage workshop ('Starting to Dig'), a week-long archaeology project at Hendon School, an archaeology summer school including expert workshops in find identification and archiving and numerous presentations at community history focussed conferences including the Community Archives conference at UCL in 20012. The team also worked with a number of groups advising them on their applications to the HLF, held one-to-one surgeries and delivered workshops on heritage research techniques such as oral history, archival research, exhibition practice and preservation of finds with grant holders. Finally as part of the the follow on funding from the AHRC Research for Community Heritage scheme DWWS 'Continuing to Dig' also worked in a more sustained fashion with ten to fifteen groups on the actual delivery of their projects. In the main, our collaboration was in the tradition of Lindqvist of exchanging skills and expertise rather than truly engaging in the co-development of new and innovative community-based heritage research, we did also work with many of the groups, especially young people, to do historical, archival, oral history and archaeological research. In some cases (such as with Mental Fight Club and AldaTerra ) the team were able to develop relationships which we hope will lead to further innovative community heritage research in the future. In terms of a final outcome, many of the groups were able to use the techniques, equipment and good practice guidance that DWWS were able to offer to produce community-based heritage research considerably enhanced from their original intended. To give one example, one project, Hoxton Hall's 'Stories of Shoreditch' reported that they had 'greatly benefited' from the guidance and conversations with DWWS on oral history and particularly on the ethics of recording and display, and that this had resulted in 'a project that is of real relevance to the community of Shoreditch and our organisation' and that this learning was now embedded in the organisation and would contribute to their future heritage and archive work. Naturally there were problems and challenges involved in this sort of programmed (as opposed to organic) collaboration, Dig Where We Stand allowed university researchers and community-based heritage and archive groups to get know each other and work together, and we seed relationships which will develop and sustain themselves over the coming years.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Dig Where We Stand project continued with follow up funding into AH/K007645/1 &amp;quot;Continuing to Dig: supporting and sustaining innovative community heritage projects in London and the South East&amp;quot;</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3F92DF7B-F6F5-40C2-AD45-921D4962AEBF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/dig-where-we-stand/2012/04/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1C730B14-0357-424F-956D-E6E4FE0A88A7"><gtr:id>1C730B14-0357-424F-956D-E6E4FE0A88A7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digging Where We Stand</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f8f6bab783aa740acfe4b72b74c8e52e"><gtr:id>f8f6bab783aa740acfe4b72b74c8e52e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flinn A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A81EF114-1465-4BC8-89E2-2F93AC0B0CD8"><gtr:id>A81EF114-1465-4BC8-89E2-2F93AC0B0CD8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Archaeology in Hertfordshire: A festschrift for Tony Rook</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/279cd8c0c6edf5b29068157bb57e1ab5"><gtr:id>279cd8c0c6edf5b29068157bb57e1ab5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dhanjal S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J013501/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9DD86EE2-EE6B-432E-AEE0-0C8669A1CBB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library &amp; information studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C96AF50D-AD7C-4C61-A30E-B8619DB33BAA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archives</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
