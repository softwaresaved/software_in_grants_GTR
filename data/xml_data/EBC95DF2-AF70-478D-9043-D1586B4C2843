Fossil fuels cannot meet this demand, as their continued use is causing global warming and in any case are a finite reserve that will be exhausted before the end of this century. Liquid fuels derived from natural plant material (biofuels), are the most promising alternative energy source for use in the transportation sector. In this regard, an alcohol called butanol is currently receiving considerable interest due to its superior properties compared to ethanol and biodiesel. Butanol has a higher energy content than ethanol, can make use of existing petrol supply and distribution channels, can be blended with petrol at higher concentrations without engine modification, offers better fuel economy and has, unlike ethanol, potential as aviation fuel. Traditionally, butanol is produced by a bacterium called Clostridium acetobutylicum when growing on growth media containing sugars. The fermentation process is known as the Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) process. In the first hald of the last century, the ABE process was second in importance/ scale only to ethanol production from yeast. However, with the advent of the petrochemical industry, the process became uneconomic and was abandoned in the western world from the 1960s onwards. The process has recently been re-established in China and Brazil, where lower operating costs make a process based on inefficient 20th century technology economic. For adoption in the western world, a more efficient process is required. Its derivation will be reliant on improvements to the bacterial strains employed. However, the rational creation of such strains will require a more detailed understanding of the complex processes within the cell that catalyse and control the formation of fermentation products. Deriving a better understanding of the process is the overall objective of this proposal. For this, a new holistic approach termed systems biology will be used, which involves iterative cycles of mathematical modelling and experimental testing. It is made possible by developments made in an earlier funding round in which crucial gene tools and methodologies were developed that will allow precise changes to be made to selected genes and the consequences assessed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The enzymes catalyzing and controlling conversion of glucose to solvents and acids are encoded by up to 40 genes. Starting with model-driven hypotheses, specific mutants will be generated by knock-in and knock-out strategies and analyzed. Selected mutants will be grown in continuous culture, allowing the imposition of reproducible, controlled perturbations. Fermentation analysis will include substrate/product concentrations, determination of key intracellular metabolites, and transcriptome time series. These data will lead to further iterative experimentation and ultimately to a fine-tuned quantitative description of the process of solventogenesis. Workpackages:- 1] Construction of artificially controlled genes required for solvent production/regulation: ACE technology will place specific chromosomal genes under inducible control. These changes, in combination with gene knock-outs, will allow rational perturbation of the system. 2] Analysis of mutants in continuous culture under standardized conditions: Strains will be grown and analyzed in continuous culture. Quantitative analysis will include substrate and product determination, identification and quantification of key intracellular metabolites, and transcriptome time series. 3] Modelling, in silico generation of hypotheses and experimental design: An iterative process of model-based hypothesis generation and experimental testing by variations of the transcriptome and the environome will be adopted for refining the model. Controlled stimuli from the environome and rapid sampling experiments will be included. 4] Data management: DaMaSys will serve as an access-controlled repository for multi-'omics' datasets as well as platform for communication and joint model development. Data pre-treatment, data consistency checks, data curation for modelling purposes, and, in part, the cyclic interaction between model-based hypothesis generation and experimental testing will be organized into automatable workflows.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficaries: The ultimate goal of this project is to generate strains of Clostridium acetobutylicum that produce biobutanol with greater productivity and which can form the basis of a commercial process for biobutanol production. The major direct beneficary is, therefore, the industrial private sector concerned with chemical commodity production. A boost for the agricultural sector is also expected, as farmers will be able to profit from the demand for cellulosic waste products which form the substrates for biobutanol production. The results will also benefit national and international government green policies in helping to replace fossil fuels with biofuel. Achieving government targets in terms of green issues will also indirectly benefit the wider general public. How they benefit from this research: At the basic level, industrial producers will benefit through the availability of strains which may be employed as the basis of an economic process for biobutanol production. These beneficaries may be expected to gain a commercial advantage over competitors. The ultimate development of a biobutanol process will reduce national, and international, reliance on fossil fuels in the transportation sector, providing a cleaner environment and therefore indirectly impacting on human health. The technological developments will also provide an opportunity for export to third countries providing revenue for UK Plc. The project will also provide the opportunity for staff working directly on the project, together with postgraduate students indirectly affiliated to the project, to become trained in the arena of the strategically important areas of 'Systems Biology' and 'Bioenergy'. These skills should prove applicable to many different projects outside of butanol metabolism. To ensure that they benefit: The project PI (NPM) already has strong links with a major UK Biofuel company, who part fund other BBSRC projects at the University, and with whom a commercial agreement is already in place. A high degree of collaboration will be maintained with this company, while at the same time other collaborative ventures will be explored. To date, previous BBSRC funding to NPM has resulted in the filing of 4 patents to cover the enabling gene technologies that make this project possible. In addition to a number of academic awards, the existence of these technologies have led to 2 X BBSRC IPA awards, 4 X industrial CASE awards, 1 X industrial studentship and an industrial research contract with a major US Pharmaceutical company. Our principle measure of success will, therefore, be the filing and subsequent licensing of patents concerned with butanol production to private companies. Through liaison with Nottingham's Research &amp;amp; Innovations service, NPM will continue to monitor the IP and commercial potential of the research to be undertaken here, and will additionally chair a consortium wide committee concerned with IP and commercialisation of the consortia outputs. Over an above these activities, the project members will endeavour to communicate their work widely, both through the scientific and non-scientific press and through various media outlets, including websites.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>452694</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1393966</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC - DBT SuBB Award: RICEFUEL</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/K020358/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>D9718EA5-0763-47EC-87E8-0AA7FE27A338</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2396136</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC sLoLa</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/K00283X/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>4A3353EA-5C0F-47E0-B5EF-0AEE37B16A72</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>244608</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>TSB award in the Advancing the Industrial Application of Synthetic Biology Feasibility Study Competition</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/L004356/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>FDEE3F92-8552-4283-9135-1C27F0F8E96C</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>365499</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ERA-IB4: Rational Engineering of Advanced Clostridia for Transformational Improvements in Fermentation (REACTIF)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/L000105/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>D0C9C4AB-004D-4890-9FC9-33FEBEC9A79B</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Historically, the bacterial genus Clostridium is most often associated with disease. Thus, the term 'clostridia' is to many synonymous with debilitating and life-threatening intoxications and disease such as botulism, tetanus, gangrene, antibiotic associated diarrhoea and food poisoning generally. However, the vast majority of all clostridia are entirely benign, and far from being the scourge of mankind, may well be its saviour. This is because the genus occupies all manner of specialised niches and as a result has evolved a plethora of bio-catalytic abilities which may be exploited for the production of specialist chemicals through an impressive array of biological transformations. As such, many species are being pursued as possible cell factories for the production of chemicals through processes that offer an alternative to traditional petro-chemical routes. 

One consequence has been the pressing need to develop gene tools and processes which may be deployed both to better understand the basis of a desirable catalytic pathway and to maximise its effectiveness in terms of productivity. Pivotal was the ability to make directed mutants in specific genes encoding the enzymes and regulators of a particular pathway. In our previous work, we developed ClosTron technology which may be used to deliberately inactivate selected genes through the insertion of segment of DNA called an intron. In this project we have developed a highly efficient mutagenesis method, in which a small DNA element, called a transposon, inserts entirely at random. This allows the isolation of mutants with the desired property (the ability to grow in the presence of high concentrations of a biofuel, like butanol). The nature of the mutation can then be determined, leading to a greater understanding of the basis of resistance, and ultimately to the derivation of rational methods to improve tolerance and hence biofuel yields. 

In addition to this fundamental advancement, we have developed a whole plethora of new tools, including systems that allow the precise control of gene expression under defined conditions, a powerful promoter system that allows the attainment of expression levels higher than any see before, and the formulation of methods of gene transfer that are more efficient than any method described before for the organism used here, Clostridium acetobutylicum. All of these developments will ultimately lead to the derivation both of strains that are more effective producers of chemicals and fuels, as well as to the discovery of more effective countermeasures against disease causing clostridial species.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>67A3A673-DE75-4534-871B-131F8562C9EE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Genetic tool to enable ClassII intron with selection marker to be inserted into any selected gene to create a knockout mutant</gtr:description><gtr:id>01D1A6CD-6F0F-48E3-8A9E-4ECFA54EA4F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Material transfer agreements have been put in place with many laboratories across the world to allow them to use this technology.

Nonetheless, a number of significant advances were made.

[1] We developed a highly effective new protocol for introducing DNA into the Clostridium acetobutylicum cell at a frequency never before reported

[2] We developed the first ever C. acetobutylicum vector conditional for replication, that is a plasmid vehicle that could only replicate itself in the cell under a permissive condition. Under the non-permissive condition (in this case the presence of IPTG), the plasmid is rapidly lost. Such a system is extremely useful, but particularly so for the delivery of transposons. Transposon are genetic elements that insert at random into genomes and form the basis of forward genetic approaches. That is to say, allow the isolation of a particular mutant phenotype with no preconception of its genotype. The subsequent determination of the genotype can provide unexpected knowledge of the process under investigation.

[3] In parallel, we developed the first transposon system for C. acetobutylicum. This was made possible by the integration of a gene encoding a special type of sigma, transcriptional factor into the clostridial genome that specifically activates the transposase enzyme responsible for the movement of the transposon element. In theory, this approach can be deployed in any clostridial species.

[4] Using the same orthogonal expression system employed to control transposase expression, we developed a highly effective inducible expression system based on the inducer lactose. The system was shown to respond in a dose dependent manner and to result in a level of expression which exceeded that seen with the strongest known clostridial promoter.

[5] In parallel to the above, ClosTron mutants in pivotal solventogenic and acidogenic genes were provided to the consortium partners for 'omic analysis and modelling studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Whilst the planned goals of the project were not achieved, a number of significant goals were achieved. The universal transposon system developed, together with its associated conditional vector delivery system, represent an extremely useful tool for forward genetic studies. Aside from its use to isolate random mutants, it may be used It may be deployed in Transposon-Directed Insertion Site Sequencing (TraDiS) to identify essential genes under niche specific conditions, and may therefore be used to identify genes involved in butanol tolerance. This approach may potentially be used in any clostridial species, including pathogens to identify virulence factors with potential as therapeutic targets. Similarly, our combination of an orthogonal promoter system with an inducible promoter could have wide application where high level, inducible control of gene expression is required.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>626E3370-8DA3-4F1F-9D5C-37553E88F2AA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>SysMO-DB was a database set up as part of the EARNET SysMO.
