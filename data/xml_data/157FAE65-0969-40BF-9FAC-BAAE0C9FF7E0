Such models are often large and complex and often appear to be without uncertainty. However, even if the model is itself deterministic in that it gives the same result for the same set of inputs, the inputs are almost always uncertain and the model structure itself is not fully known. Thus any model result is uncertain. Determining the uncertainties in models is often referred to as uncertainty quantification. This is a hard problem; even for the forward problem where we know the uncertainty in the model inputs and we want to propagate it to the model outputs. Even harder is inverse modelling when (uncertain) observations are used to reduce the uncertainty in the inputs. Once we have done both inverse and forward modelling we can estimate the uncertainty in the model output that is being used to help make the decision. However, in any decision the evidence from the model is rarely the only consideration. The decision maker has his or her own uncertainties and biases and these must be taken into account and understood. Two decision makers given the same evidence will often make different decisions. Presenting the evidence to decision makers (often untrained in mathematics and statistics) is difficult and complex. The network will look at new ways of presenting narratives and visualisations of uncertainty to decision makers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results from the network will help any decision maker who uses evidence from numerical modelling in the decision making process. The list of applications is huge but here are some examples:

1. Engineers use numerical models to make design calculations, saving money on expensive experiments and tests in wind tunnels for example.
2. Climate policy is set using the results of complex numerical models of both the physical and social world, all of which have significant, often unquantified, uncertainties.
3, Personalised medicine is increasingly being practised. By modelling, say, the heart of an individual, a personalised diagnosis and treatment plan can be produced. However it is vital that the clinician making these decisions knows the quality of the model results so they can be balanced with other uncertainties
4. In the financial world many decisions use numerical models, from reinsurance of natural hazards to banking regulation and the use of economic forecasting to set government policy.

All of these examples show that there is a practical requirement for the quantification of uncertainty in the complex models used, a better understanding of how decision makers use such evidence and how the uncertainty is presented to the decision makers, both verbally and visually. The network will address these problems and by including practical decision makers in its ranks will propagate the results</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>347992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P016774/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
