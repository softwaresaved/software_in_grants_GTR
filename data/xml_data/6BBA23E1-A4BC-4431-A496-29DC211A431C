Compensating human rights violations</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N000927/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>When individuals are mistreated by European governments, the European Court of Human Rights is responsible for reviewing state actions under the European Convention of Human Rights. If the individuals are successful in proving a violation, the ECtHR may award them damages for the treatment suffered. Whilst domestic courts of the 47 Council of Europe (COE) Member States, over which the Court has jurisdiction, usually award damages on the basis of scales that are public, this is not the case with the ECtHR. The Court sets out no rules or guidelines as to when individuals are likely to get compensation; it also does not explain which elements of their treatment applicants should emphasise nor how much they should ask for. There is no information about maximum or minimum amounts awarded to individuals for specific violations nor about how claims in one case might compare to those in other cases. Often, individuals turning to the Court ask for millions of euros in damages, but only receive a few thousand.

Many scholars insist that in the human rights context damages can play a crucial role in ensuring individual justice. The process of according compensation focuses the proceedings before the court on the individual, the victim of the violation and allows him/her the vindication of their rights. But the current practice of the Court appears arbitrary and opaque.

In response to demands from practice (lawyers who represent victims of rights violations and national judges who enforce judgments of the Court), this project seeks to fill the gap created by the ECtHR practice for the first time. Through an empirical quantitative and qualitative study of the last ten years of caselaw relating to just satisfaction, the project will discern the legal principles from the practice of the Court and critically assess the Court's role in awarding compensation for human rights violations. It does this in three steps:

First, the project quantitatively analyses 12,000 cases of the ECtHR to determine when and how the Court awards damages for human rights violations. Second, the project looks at the legal basis on which the Court exercises its function. As an international court, the ECtHR only has subsidiary jurisdiction to award damages. National courts are arguably better placed to adapt compensation to the specific jurisdiction or the facts of the case. Thus, when the Court decides to award damages, it faces important questions of legitimacy. Through interviews with judges the project therefore seeks to understand how those who sit on the Court perceive its role in protecting human rights. Building on both stages, the final step of the project examines the discrepancies between how the ECtHR judges perceive human rights and what monetary value they attach to them. In dialogue with judges, causes and justifications for these discrepancies will be identified and possible solutions explored.

The project brings together academics and practitioners from different jurisdictions of the COE to fill the gap created by the Court. Through research visits to the Court, advisory group meetings and a three-day dissemination workshop, practitioners, government officials, and national and European judges will be consulted to ensure cross-fertilisation and knowledge exchange. They will be involved in the preparation, implementation as well as dissemination of the project so as to guarantee the greatest impact.

This project can make a fundamental contribution to human rights law by creating a new law of human rights damages. It will generate an important amount of new data, which will be empirically analysed for the first time to seek out legal principles to be applied in future cases both on the international level and in courts of the 47 countries of the COE. More broadly, the project represents an exciting opportunity to explain better the role of the ECtHR and understand what drives its practice of compensating for human rights violations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research aims to benefit not only (1) academics (see 'academic beneficiaries'), but also (2) the public sector, (3) the private sector, (4) the third sector and (5) the general public.

In the domestic public sector, what price the ECtHR assigns to human rights is of particular relevance to the judiciary, the government, and the Parliament. For judges, the results of the study will be directly relevant in shaping their approach to human rights damages. Currently under the Human Rights Act, judges seek to mirror the approach of the ECtHR. However, since its approach is unclear, national judges often hesitate as to whether to award damages and what these should be. The empirical analysis of the study will clarify these inconsistencies and fill the gap.
The government, which appears as respondent in human rights cases before the ECtHR, and the Parliament are involved in shaping human rights legislation in the UK. Both branches will benefit from this study by enabling legislative reform. In this regard, the Law Commission for England and Wales (the law reform body established by the Parliament) and the Joint Committee for Human Rights (the select committee of both Houses) will be specifically targeted in the dissemination of the project's findings to encourage and facilitate law reform.
The domestic impact of the study is not limited only to the UK public sector but in equal measure applies also to the 47 countries of the Council of Europe. The results of the empirical analysis are likely to have important consequences for the judiciaries, governments and legislative bodies across Europe, affecting both their judicial practice and human rights laws.

In the international public sector, the project is of utmost relevance to the ECtHR itself. Although some of the legal principles guiding its practice may already be known to ECtHR judges, the project will uncover potential biases. In addition, ECtHR judges will be able to benefit from the differing views of their colleagues as to the scope of the Court's function. Both may affect and change future ECtHR decision-making. Beyond Europe, the results will benefit human rights bodies of the United Nations and other regional human rights courts and tribunals, which look to the ECtHR and refer to its jurisprudence.

In the private and third sector - both in the UK and across the Council of Europe - the project will have a crucial impact on practitioners (barristers and solicitors) and NGOs who advise victims of human rights violations and represent them before the Court. This project has been particularly tailored to the demands of these audiences so that they can benefit from enhanced clarity on the law of damages, improve victim representation and enhance their potential for rights vindication. At the end of the project, both practitioners as well as victims of human rights violations - the general public - will understand more clearly which elements of a particular human rights violation to focus on.

These four audiences benefit from the project in the following ways:
- Understand the legal principles behind the ECtHR practice and clarify the inconsistencies in caselaw;
- Acquire access to a new dataset of all the relevant ECtHR decisions of the last ten years;
- Gain insight into how judges perceive the Court's power and its scope;
- Participate in knowledge exchange and learn from beneficiaries from other backgrounds and jurisdictions of the Council of Europe. 

The Pathways to Impact strategy (see below) has been designed so that the project will have an immediate and relevant impact on these audiences. The beneficiaries have been involved in the research project from the conceptualisation phase onwards, and will be involved (including through the Advisory Group and the Bridge) in its implementation and the dissemination of the findings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>213456</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N000927/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>10601309-838E-4D0F-A4EE-B765E0CB1A81</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
