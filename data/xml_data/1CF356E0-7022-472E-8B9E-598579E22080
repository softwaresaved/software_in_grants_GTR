Eliot Editorial Project</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/G011303/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The purpose of the T. S. Eliot Editorial Project is to co-ordinate, for the first time, the editing of the poetry, plays, critical writings, and correspondence of perhaps the pre-eminent and most influential writer of the twentieth century. \n\nSince Eliot's death in 1965 his oeuvre has had only a partial, unsatisfactory afterlife. While the unpublished Clark and Turnbull lectures, _The Varieties of Metaphysical Poetry_, were published in 1993, establishing appropriate textual principles and annotational standards for such materials, a large amount of his published prose has gone out of print. Moreover, a remarkably extensive number of prose pieces, ranging from essays and lectures to introductions and reviews, and contributions to debates on questions as varied as literature, religion, politics, education, publishing and cultural commentary, have never been collected for the world-wide readership that aspires to enjoy access to a complete and annotated edition of his works. \n\nWhile portions of Eliot's poetry -- notably _Inventions of the March Hare_ (1996) -- have been issued in full-dress scholarship, the majority of the poems have not yet been edited to a standard that will meet the expectations of scholar, student and general reader. The same holds true for the plays.\n\nWith the commitment and support of the T. S. Eliot Estate and Faber and Faber, this Project will ensure that no fewer than six volumes -- _Complete Poems_ (2 vols), _Complete Plays_ (1 vol), _Complete Prose_ (2 of an envisaged 7 vols), together with a third volume of the _Collected Letters_ (covering the period 1926-1928), edited or co-edited by UK-based scholars -- will be delivered for publication by the year 2012. Because the Project brings together the work of dedicated team of scholars, editors and critics, under the academic management of the Institute of English Studies (Director, Professor Warwick Gould) at the University of London, all of the volumes can be delivered in quick order, and at about the same time. \n\nConcerted and co-ordinated effort is the key to the success of this enterprise. The editors will work in partnership, agreeing upon conventions including abbreviations and modes of cross-reference, and sharing findings as needed. The volumes will correspond too in terms of presentation, apparatus and supplementary materials including collations, draft variants and appendices. The project participants will be making use of unprecedented and shared access to the archival resources (both the library and a wealth of papers) of the collections of Mrs Valerie Eliot and of Faber &amp;amp; Faber, and will also share exclusive access to Professor Schuchard's digital database of the prose writings.\n\nThe outcome of this combined enterprise will be to establish authoritative and fully co-ordinated editions of the poetry, plays, prose and letters of the highest textual accuracy. At long last, it will enable readers to see Eliot whole: the tally of his works will include over 200 printed but unrecorded prose pieces and 90 unpublished prose items. Scholarly notes will identify sources, allusions and parallels. Also, by providing access to the totality of published and unpublished works, it will facilitate a fresh and thorough critical assessment of Eliot as poet, critic, playwright, publisher, correspondent and cultural commentator. In addition, this collective edition will situate Eliot's works in their genetic, generic and artistic relation to one another. Eliot himself noted, in a late interview: '_Burnt Norton_ began with bits that had to be cut out of _Murder in the Cathedral_.' He also took pains to make the larger critical point that 'writing plays ... made a difference to the writing of the _Four Quartets_.' This Project will accordingly afford a context for comprehending the relationship between the poems and plays and all associated works, and it will facilitate the fullest appreciation and critical comprehension of Eliot's work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>767531</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Faber &amp; Faber</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Prose of T.

Haffenden, is to be published by Faber &amp;amp; Faber in 2018. The Prose of T. S. Eliot: The Critical Edition, ed.

Eliot, led by Professor Ronald Schuchard and his funded colleagues, plus American university collaborators and representatives from Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, sparked immense interest and lively debates and suggestions for improvement of the online facilities. This kind of feedback has I believe proved invaluable to both academic editors and the publisher-editorial technicians, and to a proportionate increase in usefulness and usability of the digital resource.

The most useful outcome of all the lectures and seminars that have run hand-in-hand with the editorial work over five years and more has been a huge access of awareness of the known and potential users (specialist scholars and the general public) of the products we have been working on. We have made students and general readers aware of the outcomes we are working towards, and those end-users have contributed to the full to our understanding of our audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ies.sas.ac.uk/study-training/research-training-summer-schools/ts-eliot-international-summer-school/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2009,2011,2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Scholarship; English literature education; cultural and critical studies. 

The total number of individual subscriptions to the digital resource The Complete Prose of T. S. Eliot is not to be known (information reserved to publisher), but I understand that there have been more than 40 international institutional subscriptions (higher than anticipated).

Harding's essay 'T. S. Eliot's Shakespeare' (Essays in Criticism 62 [2012], 160-77) was top ranked as the 'most-read' article on the OUP Essays in Criticism home page from June 2012 to February 2013. The essay was praised by the esteemed scholar James Shapiro (author of '1606: William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear') as 'far and away the best thing out there on Eliot and Shakespeare, and I suspect will be for a very long while.'
 
Sales figures for volumes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Letters of T S Eliot (published in the UK by Faber and Faber Ltd, and in the USA by Yale University Press) are not officially available, but certainly run into the several thousands.

The Poems of T. S. Eliot: The Annotated Edition, edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue (supported by the AHRC), was published in two volumes by Faber and Faber, London, in November 2015, and by the Johns Hopkins University Press in the USA at the same date. The UK edition has already gone through three impressions; and it is my understanding that to date (March 2017), sales in the UK for volume 1 run to more than 11,000 copies, for volume 2 to more than 7,000 copies.

Reviews of this magnificent publication of Eliot's poems (as of February 2016) include the following:

'Anyone who cares about literature will be grateful for [this] feat of editing.' Leo Robson, New Statesman

'A treasure chest, not only delivering poetry never seen or collected before but with wonderfully responsive and suggestive annotation and commentary - it'll take years to assimilate, years of pleasure.' Evening Standard

'I suspect [it] will be my book of the decade.' Spectator

'[An] extraordinary feat of Eliot scholarship is the two-volume annotated edition of Eliot's poems put together by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue . . . Every possible allusion is tracked and quoted, and the Possum's labyrinthine echo-chamber of a mind is laid out for our contemplation in its full, baffling entirety.' Mark Ford, TLS

'A great edition does not set its texts in stone, but transplants them, so to speak, to a new soil Ricks and McCue give us Eliot in all his guises and masks, in which his identity as a poet coheres. The texts are scrupulously sifted, and the editors' decisions, even where contestable, rest on reasoned grounds. The densely packed notes sparkle; Eliot's allusiveness, in particular is traced to sublime effect.' Daniel Karlin, TLS

'The ultimate scholarly edition of Eliot's poetry . . . It is a colossal 
achievement' Claire Lowdon, TLS

'Truly the texts here (cleaned up, restored, unearthed) are a feast, and so is the scholarship that surrounds them.' Andrew Motion, Guardian

'These volumes are not merely a monument to T S Eliot, they are a blazing demonstration of what literary criticism, at its best, can do for literature.' Financial Times

'The editors, Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, have built a vast and fascinating world out of their annotation.' Daily Telegraph

'Volume one contains 346 pages of poems to 965 of commentary. In the second volume, notes follow text on a poem-by-poem basis, but their combined 290 pages is still outweighed by a 367-page &amp;quot;textual history&amp;quot;. It is a monumental achievement, and one that frames important and timely questions about the state of Eliot's reputation.' David Wheatley, Guardian

'This meticulously produced edition succeeds magnificently in being what Eliot - a literary critic with the most exacting standards - would have wanted: all his verse, comic and serious, printed in one place, and illuminated for readers by one of the great labours of modern scholarship.' Jeremy Noel-Todd, Sunday Times

J. McCue gave an invited lecture, 'T. S. Eliot: Realism and Reality', at the National Portrait Gallery, London, on 16 March 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>790787FA-4FE6-4E69-AF1A-5DCC5EFA8FED</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The edition published in 2015 in both the UK and the USA as The Poems of T. S. Eliot, ed. Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue (the latter having been funded full-time for three years by this AHRC award) is universally regarded as the most authoritative edition of Eliot's poetry ever to be published: a world leader in critical and editorial scholarship; a model of textual research. It was nominated in numerous national newspapers as 'Book of the Year' 2012, and has been awarded the prestigious Pegasus Award by the Poetry Foundation of the USA.

The Complete Prose of T. S. Eliot: The Critical Edition (published online by the Johns Hopkins University Press in formal association with Faber &amp;amp; Faber Ltd) has been equally celebrated by critics and scholars for the range and depth of its scholarship; for establishing a definitive text for the totality of Eliot's prose writings, including volumes, individual essays and reviews, introductions and prefaces, and extending to the discovery of many hundreds of mislaid or previously unknown essays and related prose writings. Twentieth-Century Literature (March 2016) wrote: 'With these editions, the importance of the project is self-evident ... the power to change understanding or assessments of Eliot.' The noted critic Timothy Materer wrote in Modernism/modernity that this edition of the prose 'will enlarge our understanding of Eliot's poetry and criticism ... When completed, the eight volumes will be a major resource for the digital age of scholarship.' The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that the edition 'will set in motion a golden era of Eliot scholarship.' 

Volume 4 of The Complete Prose of T. S. Eliot: The Critical Edition, co-edited by Harding (award-holder) has been submitted by Johns Hopkins University Press for the Modern Languages Association Distinguished Edition Prize (winner to be announced in September 2017).

The remaining four volumes of the Complete Prose of T. S. Eliot: The Critical Edition (of the projected edition in eight volumes) will be appearing online over the next two years: this includes volume 7, co-edited by Javadi (award-holder), which is already complete for press.

The edition of The Plays of T. S. Eliot, ed. Haffenden, is scheduled for publication by Faber and Faber in spring 2018.

The edition of The Letters of T. S. Eliot, under the general editorship of the Principal Investigator John Haffenden, has been carried forward well beyond the specific scope of the award. Volume 7, covering the period 1934-1935, is to be published in June 2007. The series has been widely applauded for gathering up the totality of Eliot's correspondence with authoritative annotation, and for hugely enlarging public and academic understanding of Eliot's life and work. The senior academic Stefan Collini has written in the 'London Review of Books' (30 Aug. 2012): '[Eliot's] letters have benefited from enormously thorough yet judicious editing. The installation of John Haffenden as general editor of this sometimes vexed edition has brought a new level of authority and precision to the annotation and other editorial matter.' Letters necessarily omitted from the published volumes (published by Faber and Faber in the UK, and by Yale University Press in the USA, are now published on the official website of the T. S. Eliot Estate: tseliot.com. The record is therefore being made complete.

Additional notices illuminate the kinds and value of the key findings in this developing edition of the poet's letters:
John Carey, Sunday Times, June 2012: 'superbly capacious and informative notes ... turn this volume, in effect, into a wonderfully illuminating chapter of biography rather than a collection of letters. The editing is a marvel from start to finish, and Eliot, even at his most critical, would surely have applauded it.'

Philip Hensher, The Spectator, 30 June 2012: 
'The editing of the Eliot letters is exemplary in its detail, authority and quality of annotation. It is the closest thing to a perfect edition of a great writer's correspondence that can be imagined. There are few collected literary correspondences of this quality now emerging in English The editing, annotation and production is of an extraordinarily high standard.'

Gabriel Josipovici, Times Literary Supplement, 2 November 2012: 'This is a wonderful volume. The notes are copious but always to the point, and include not only extracts from later letters we might have to wait a long time to see published in full, but also invaluable accounts of how Eliot's contemporaries saw him at the time.'

Juliet Nicolson, Sunday Times 'Books of the Year', 24 Nov. 2012: 
'The Letters of T. S. Eliot Volume 3: 1926-1927 moved me deeply. This last selection under the impressive joint editorship of John Haffenden with Eliot's second wife Valerie includes the unfolding tragedy of Eliot's first marriage.'

David Sexton, 'Books of the Year', Evening Standard, 29 November 2012: 
'The Letters of T. S. Eliot Volume 3 1926-1927, impeccably edited by Valerie Eliot and John Haffenden, have new insight into the great poet in the years when he was editing the Criterion, writing Sweeney Agonistes and the Ariel poems and converting to Anglicanism, as well as still attempting life with his wife, Vivien.'

Paul Batchelor, Saturday Guardian, 14 July 2012: 'meticulous footnotes'.

The Rt Revd Lord Harries, Church Times, 31 Aug. 2012: 
'excellent footnotes and biographical details of correspondents'

Mark Ford, The New York Review of Books, 25 Oct. 2012: 
'The inclusion of numerous letters by Eliot's family and friends, and the extensive footnotes that excerpt liberally from missives received, as well as explicating all references and offering useful mini-biographies of every potential Criterion contributor Eliot ever contacted, mean these volumes provide an exhaustively detailed picture of the circumstances in which Eliot's correspondence, and his criticism and his poems, were written. The decision also allows for a range of different perspectives on the Eliots' problems.'

Volume 4:
Juliet Nicolson, Daily Telegraph, 19 Jan. 2013: 'In the fourth volume of these enlightening and occasionally electrifying letters, the two conflicting stories that dominate T. S. Eliot's life are gradually revealed with poignant and often painful clarity hundreds of superbly enhancing footnotes pack this volume
 'There is a particular bleakness attached to this latest lengthy addition to the Eliot biography. This is the last volume that will benefit from the editorship of Valerie Eliot Her intimate knowledge of her enigmatic husband makes her presence here ubiquitous, especially in the selection of footnotes, the exemplary biographical register and the detailed summary of chronological events all of which ensure the reader is looked after with meticulous care the impressive scholarship of her co-editor John Haffenden'

Lesley McDowell, The Independent on Sunday, 13 Jan. 2013: 
'this full disclosure of a writing life is quite invaluable.'

Henry Hitchings, Financial Times, 2 Feb. 2013: 
'this volume is valuable for scholars of Eliot's work and of the period in which he lived'

Adam Mars-Jones, The Observer, 10 Jan. 2013:

This will enable us comprehensively to re-evaluate Eliot's standing as one of the three or four most important and influential British writers of the modern period; and it will open up new dimensions of the literary history itself.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The Complete Prose of T.
