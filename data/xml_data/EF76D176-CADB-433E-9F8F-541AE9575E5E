You may be misled or defrauded if you visit the wrong website; or if you visit a website with the right name but at the wrong IP address; or if you visit a site at the right IP address, but hosted in another part of the world. It has thus become clear that we have to protect the Internet at the infrastructure level, which means protecting the naming (DNS) and routing (BGP) mechanisms. The industry is about to deploy DNSSEC, and various ad-hoc mechanisms are being used to protect BGP.However these deployments will take years, and many firms will initially get it wrong. There is a clear case for NPL to monitor the process in order to measure what's working and what isn't; to create pressure on sectors of the economy that lag behind; to help improve both authentication and monitoring tools; and to provide an authoritative voice on the move to a more secure infrastructure. Our research programme will help create this capability at NPL by establishing the monitoring framework. We also plan to develop a BGP reflector system to deal with global routing table growth out of band , along with an authentication and validation system for the route servers used by internet exchanges such as LINX and AMSIX to improve peering point resilience and to prevent a number of possible types of attack.We believe that this is of global importance, and that as players such as the US Department of Commerce and the IETF have got bogged down in political wrangling, a UK / European standards lead has a good chance of developing into global leadership.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Call refers to the CSIA National Information Assurance Strategy figure of 10bn pa for the cost of security breaches to UK plc, and also to the BERR 2008 survey which found that the average cost of a security breach at a company with over 250 employees was 90-170K. A very much more comprehensive survey of available statistics on the costs of online crime can be found in the ENISA report Security Economics and European Policy , R Anderson et al., 2008 (available from ENISA or from www.ross-anderson.com). Online crime is getting rapidly worse as our societies become more dependent on the Internet, and as the relevant tools and know-how become more widely available to criminals. The deployment of better infrastructure security in the Internet is urgent from both economic and national security perspectives. However, because of the complexity of deployed systems and the great variety of actors - with huge variation in competence - this deployment is likely to be extended and chaotic. A clear standards lead, with a solid evidence base of empirical measurements, can have a quite disproportionate impact and should save the UK (and world) economy billions of pounds of fraud and other costs over the medium term.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>291818</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ICANN Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with ICANN</gtr:description><gtr:id>7375D3A8-2E1C-4863-B191-589ADCCDE5F9</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Study on WHOIS Proxy/Privacy Abuse.

We've given many invited talks at conferences not just on computer science but on banking and even criminology. It was in fact requested by the then Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence and since then has been one of two reference sources widely used as a baseline for policy (the other being a flawed Detica study that we set out to debunk). 

The Internet resilience work has been less cited but informed the work of the secure interdomain routing group that has been designing the specification of BGPsec over the past couple of years. Its recommendations have also been adopted as ENISA policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AC94C7DC-7A7C-46EB-994A-BB578C5F36CA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The post was originally envisioned as a means of providing 'knowledge transfer' from the academic security research community to NPL. Unfortunately, by the time Richard arrived the relevant people at NPL had been made redundant -- so there were significant limitations as to what might be achieved. However, it was possible to identify a significant project (the Whois study for ICANN) that NPL would never have tendered for otherwise. The contract was eventually awarded to NPL and the work completed before the end of the project timeline. A key outcome from this project will be a novel open source Whois parsing system, which will be of use to a range of different organisations. 

We also collected data on a number of other aspects of cybercrime including how expired bank domains are exploited, and wrote high-profile reports on both the costs of cybercrime and the resilience of the Internet interconnection ecosystem. With the benefit of three years' hindsight, these two papers have had the highest impact. The Internet resilience paper has been adopted as ENISA policy and informed the Secure Interdomain Routing working group producing the BGPsec protocol specification, while the Costs of Cybercrime paper has been widely cited and has provided a more believable baseline for both researchers and policymakers interested in online crime.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The deft-whois.org package is attracting interest by various industry groups (such as APWG) and individual cybercrime researchers. The ICANN study is going to impact decisions made as to the future of the Whois system, with the many of the comments made being favourable. eg:

The RySG believes that the scope and thoroughness of the Draft Report provides sufficient information to support careful analysis of its stated results. Most importantly, we believe that the study results provide objective data that will facilitate policy development work going forward. The ICANN work will be exploited via the industry and through ICANN while the reports on cybercrime and Internet resilience are having impact on policy - with the latter having been adopted as EU policy by ENISA.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6691E433-701D-4147-886A-60BA41218F08</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies
