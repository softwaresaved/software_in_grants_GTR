There was a danger that many of these works might have disappeared because of their ephemeral nature and poor technical condition. The project has sought to determine the best examples of works from the period, conserve and preserve them (in partnership with the Scottish Screen Archive), to enable further scholarly activity. An archive, exhibitions, salons and a Content Management System (CMS), have been employed to disseminate the works to the public and academic community, with further exhibitions being planned for 2008-2010.\n\nThe CMS offers online access to interviews with artists and animateurs, documentation, background material and associated ephemera. The interviews are in video/audio form and downloadable PDF files. \n\nThe REWIND ARCHIVE and COLLECTION currently has 250 works including single channel videoworks and 30 installations. \n\nResearch Leave is required to complete the main publication and plan and curate a series of exhibitions, screenings, and other events. \n\nAs the Research Grant was awarded before FEC an application for Research Leave is allowable and was indicated in the original application.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37317</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>REWIND - British Artists' Video

16th - 21st March 2009
A screening of a series of videos from the ,'Scratch Video' genre which was prevalent in the 1980s and has generally been forgotten about in contemporary culture. This genre was the first to use samples of video and mix them with sampled music and sound, leading into the dance music generation of the early 1990s. The works that will be shown are some of the best examples of this work from British artists.
These works use as their source, extracts from archive footage, news bulletins, old feature films and TV footage. They allude to socio-political and contemporary events such as the Cold War and Thatcher's Britain. Some of the issues raised are still relevant today.

Impacts derive from archival research in contemporary art practice, specifically curatorial activities within video &amp;amp; experimental film, and the European avant-garde. The focus is on cultural impact in the UK and internationally including public awareness and engagement and includes:
o the impact upon curation in the contemporary gallery and museum sector by their use of the REWIND online resources and publishing (books, articles and DVD anthology);
o partnerships with, and the influencing and enabling of, independent curators in the contemporary gallery and museums sector, leading to public exhibitions;
o widening audiences through publishing, online resources (including social media) and exhibitions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>54C6AB53-C9E4-4112-8D43-BDBC7B3043C8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Award supported research leave to complete the writing and editing of the publication for the main REWIND project (Grant Reference
