One of the proposed scenarios involves the delivery of biologically important compounds such as amino acids on the primordial Earth by the impact of meteorites on the Earth's surface. In the early 90's, several works reported the discovery of more than seventy amino acids in meteorites, the majority of which have no known terrestrial occurrence. This finding supports the exogenous hypothesis for the origin of life. 

It is thus currently believed that amino acids may have formed in the interstellar medium, where complex organics, i.e. large carbon-based molecules, have been found. Laboratory experiments of highly energetic processes such as illumination by ultraviolet photons or bombardment by cosmic rays on interstellar ice analogs, have indeed found that these processes are very efficient in the production of large organic molecules and, in particular, in the formation of amino acids.

Despite this progress in the past twenty years, the direct detection of amino acids in the interstellar medium remains elusive. Previous works focused on the search of amino acids in regions across the Galaxy where massive stars form. These regions are relatively hot, and are known to show an active chemistry which induces the production of large amounts of complex organics. The spectrum of light observed toward these regions is highly populated by molecular emission lines at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths, resembling a forest of lines. In this highly populated spectra, the brightest line features correspond to the more abundant species in the interstellar medium. This makes the identification of less abundant species such as amino acids challenging. As a consequence, no firm detection of amino acids in the interstellar medium has been reported to date. 

In this research project, we will use a novel theoretical and observational approach to detect the simplest amino acids, glycine and alanine, in the interstellar medium. This approach considers that the initial stages in the formation of Solar-type systems, characterized by very cold temperatures (about 10 degrees above absolute zero), are better suited for the detection of amino acids. 

In a first step, the chemistry of glycine and alanine will be characterized theoretically assuming very cold conditions resembling those of young Solar-type systems. This will help us to infer the main chemical routes involved in the destruction and formation of glycine and alanine at cold temperatures. In a second step, we will perform theoretical modelling of the emission spectrum of these species. This will allow us to establish the parts of the spectrum of light where the probability to detect glycine and alanine is higher. Finally, we will perform deep observations of these species by using the unprecedented capabilities of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) located on the Chajnantor plateau in Chile. The increased sensitivity of this facility (by more than a factor of 10 with respect to previous instrumentation) offers the opportunity, for the first time, to accomplish the detection of amino acids in space. 

This research not only will allow us to fully characterize the pre-biotic chemistry of amino acids, but will allow us to directly link the formation of these complex organics in the interstellar medium with their subsequent delivery onto planetary systems. The detection of amino acids at the early stages in the formation of Solar-type systems will represent a milestone in our understanding of the emergence of life on Earth.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results derived from this research are expected to have a high impact on the wider public because of their immediate implications on how key biological ingredients for life such as amino acids may have originated in the Universe. This topic attracts large interest from all audiences and its relevance has been recognized by the STFC as indicated in its Strategy Report, &amp;quot;A new vision for new times&amp;quot; (http://www.stfc.ac.uk/resources/pdf/vision.pdf). 

The question about the origin of life requires answers to a wide variety of second level unknowns. And by the end of this research grant we will be in a strong position to answer whether the simplest amino acids, glycine and alanine, could have formed in very cold gas at the earliest stages in the formation of Solar-type systems. This will provide a natural way to explain how these biologically important compounds may have reached the surface of the primordial Earth by meteorite impacts, and it will help us to understand whether these processes occur in other Solar-type systems across the Galaxy.

Because of their high impact, these results have the potential to inspire and encourage young people to pursue research careers in Astronomy and Astrochemistry. This is strategically important for the UK since young students will be the future users of cutting edge facilities such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). This will secure continuity for these facilities as well as momentum to design future radio and millimeter/sub-millimeter instrumentation, with its subsequent impact on the industry and economy sectors in the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197037</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>SKA Square Kilometre Array</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Member of the SKA Cradle of Life Science Working Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>01BBA97D-F171-48D8-9D25-27D6D64E5985</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The VLA data have been obtained already and the analysis is in progress.

The goal of this proposal is to measure grain growth in the young star-forming cluster rho Ophiucus A (see also below). As part of this preparatory science, Melanie Koheler, a Marie Curie Fellow at QMUL, and myself have performed simulations of observational signatures of grain size and grain material composition at long wavelengths so that these parameters can be constrained by performing measurements of the thermal continuum emission of dust grains at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths with ALMA, the VLA and the SKA.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Jodcast (link available at http://www.jodcast.net/archive/201604Extra/)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BE35B08E-A295-49F2-B2F4-BF34E3325953</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Last December I was interviewed for the Jodcast, an astronomy podcast from the University of Manchester's Jodrell Bank Observatory.

He has introduced several mechanisms for molecular formation on the surface of dust grains such as radical-radical diffusion, UV photo-desorption, and chemical reactive desorption. In addition, he is expanding the chemical network of UCL_CHEM in order to include gas-phase and grain surface reactions of nitrogen-bearing complex organic molecules, key for understanding the formation of amino acids. In just six months, he has made the changes to UCL_CHEM and has competed the chemical network for HNCO, CH3NCO (first detected in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the Rosetta mission) and NH2CHO (a precursor of glycine, the simplest amino acid). The results of the chemical modelling of CH3NCO have already been used for a recently submitted publication (Martin-Domenech, Rivilla, Jimenez-Serra, Quenard et al., submitted to ApJ Letters, arXiv: 1701.04376), and David Quenard is currently working on a publication where he will report the updated version of UCL_CHEM and the full chemical network for these species (Quenard, Jimenez-Serra et al., in preparation).

This is leap forward in our understanding of the building blocks of amino acids such as NH2CHO, whose formation pathways (gas phase vs grain surface) are under strong debate. We demonstrate that both processes (gas phase and grain surface) contribute to the formation of these molecules but with different efficiencies depending on the physical conditions of the astronomical source.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Improvement of chemical code UCl_CHEM and development of chemical network for nitrogen-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7D6BA028-72D5-475B-8131-331A8CD7F27F"><gtr:id>7D6BA028-72D5-475B-8131-331A8CD7F27F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Complex Organic Molecules tracing shocks along the outflow cavity in the high-mass protostar IRAS&amp;nbsp;20126+4104</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ceb47d1fcb7701dd8e3c729c45d9ed1a"><gtr:id>ceb47d1fcb7701dd8e3c729c45d9ed1a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Palau A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/620D0E37-26A1-4232-8DFC-B6E1F032581C"><gtr:id>620D0E37-26A1-4232-8DFC-B6E1F032581C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Science Case for ALMA Band 2 and Band 2+3</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ArXiv e-prints</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c6e01d1b42198d448ce10819788e03e6"><gtr:id>c6e01d1b42198d448ce10819788e03e6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fuller G.
