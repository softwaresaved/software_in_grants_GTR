More than two decades and dozens of repeat studies later, experts have still not reached a consensus on alleged sperm count decline or the future of sperm count levels and the fate of the human race. One problem in tracking sperm counts over time is that technologies for counting sperm have changed, which some experts argue, could explain reported drops in sperm counts. Not only have techniques changed over time, but they also vary by location and practitioner. Amid the variation in twentieth century sperm counting practices, state agencies like the World Health Organization adopted standards for sperm and semen parameters. These standards attempted to answer the question, what is normal? More specifically, how many sperm would a man need to father a child? How many sperm would a population need on average to sustain itself?

The purpose of this research is to examine the history of the standardisation of sperm counting technologies and practices in order to shed light on the current debates. To date, no research has explored the variety of techniques historically used to count sperm, the decision of the World Health Organisation to adopt a sperm count &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot;, or the reliability of the gold standard to predict male fertility. The &amp;quot;Counting Sperm&amp;quot; research project, led by Dr. Liberty Walther Barnes at the University of Cambridge, addresses each of these points, uncovering the history of sperm counting in the twentieth century and offering clues into the mystery of sperm count decline.

Sperm counts reveal more than just male fertility. They provide a window into other pressing social issues, like environmental degradation and population growth. Numerous studies have shown that exposure to chemical toxins and pollutants hamper sperm production. If sperm counts are indeed trending downward, policy-makers must carefully consider how impacts to the environment are also affecting public health and what kinds of public policies are necessary to preserve fertility and protect the environment. Dr. Barnes' research provides clues into the mystery of sperm count decline, helping other researchers untangle the available statistics on sperm counts by identifying their sources and methods of attainment. Additionally, Dr. Barnes analyses the fundamental facts and assumptions that informed the gold standard for sperm counts, what this standard is believed to reveal about male fertility, and the evidence marshaled to support these claims.

As part of this project Dr. Barnes will collect oral histories from expert scientists and practitioners who pioneered practices for counting sperm in the twentieth century. These histories will be preserved in archives at the British Library and be made available for use by other scholars and journalists. Dr. Barnes will host public forums the Cambridge Festival of Ideas and at the annual meetings of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) to debate the future of human sperm production around the globe and educate the public about the value and meaning behind sperm counts. Dr. Barnes will maintain a website to provide information on sperm counting to political advocacy groups and the general public. The findings from this research will culminate in scholarly articles and a book detailing the history of the standardisation of sperm counting practices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Sperm count levels matter to government agencies, private corporations, third sector entities and the general public. As described in the Case for Support, the findings from this study will help to clarify the points of contention within the sperm count decline debates and shed light on the predictive value of the World Health Organisation's sperm count &amp;quot;gold standard.&amp;quot; As explained in the Objectives Summary, the PI will liaise between the medical-scientific community and the many institutions and individuals concerned with sperm counts, fertility, and public health.

STATE SECTOR: Sperm count science is particularly important to the government agencies that monitor public health and strive to protect the environment, because sperm count decline can predict the future reproductive health of populations and indicates a rise in the population's exposure to environmental toxins known to hamper sperm production. During her research the PI will gain a clearer understanding of the hazards and toxins proven to harm sperm production. Her findings will educate policy-makers on the validity of data, the discrepancies between data sets, and the predictive value of the gold standard - information vital to the creation of public policies that can protect men from fertility decline. As many European demographers have shown, the future of the UK's economic growth and stability depends upon a healthy and regenerative population. Aims to protect the environment improve everyone's quality of life and health.

PRIVATE SECTOR: Sperm testing laboratories, ART (Assisted Reproductive Technologies) clinics, and sperm banks are all concerned with the accuracy of sperm counting techniques and the reliability of sperm count data -- issues that will be addressed by the proposed research project. Private companies will also receive direct marketing benefits by sponsoring the Impact activities of this project (see Pathways to Impact). Bourn Hall, where the PI will conduct her fieldwork, will benefit from the voluntary labour the PI will provide in their facility.

THIRD SECTOR: Many non-profit agencies that advocate for family fertility and environmental protection will benefit from this research. The PI is dedicated to writing articles that these groups can use in their magazines and websites to educate the public about sperm production issues and how they may be resolved. Furthermore, the installation produced by the PI for professional meetings will also be displayed at the anthropology museum in Cambridge, open free to the public (see Pathways to Impact and Objective #9).

GENERAL PUBLIC: Individuals and families care about reproduction. The PI's commitment to public outreach (Obj #8 &amp;amp; #9) will provide helpful information to adults concerned about their fertility and the future fertility of their children. Research studies show that 13-15% of couples in Europe and North America have trouble conceiving and deal with fertility-related issues. The website generated by this project will serve as a free and accessible resource to the general public, loaded with information and links addressing sperm production and fertility. The debate on sperm count decline held during Cambridge's Festival of Ideas will be an educational opportunity open to the public at no cost. (Website and public debate detailed in Pathways to Impact.)

STAFF: This project will help the PI sharpen her professional skills in leadership, management, organization, finance, public affairs, networking, and website development, which will benefit her throughout her career in any employment sector. The Research Assistant will also benefit by honing skills in database management, website development, research and writing.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>218724</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L010720/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0CCE05F7-E409-4D0C-B074-FE53B9DCFB6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomedical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BECA85F-CCD1-43D9-9B33-FFDFF6377498</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med Soc/Soc Health &amp; Illness</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
