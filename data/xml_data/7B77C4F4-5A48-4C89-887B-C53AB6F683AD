This initiative identifies the private sector as having a pivotal role in delivering sustainable development and a more just society. It links sustainable development priorities with long-term business goals in terms of growth, social equity, environmental protection and risk management. It also make a call to academia to be involved as partners in this debate, and specifically invites Business Schools to work with businesses in 'collaborative platforms to develop curricula and research programmes that provide current and future business leaders with the necessary mind-sets, skills and knowledge to lead companies to more sustainable outcomes' (p.17). 

This Seminar Series proposal is a direct response by a group of researchers from UK and Irish business schools, together with a representative from a major professional body, to this call. All of the co-investigators are part of existing academic, professional, and policy networks including: the UN Global Compact UK Network; the UN Women Network; the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW); Business in the Community; the Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME) Regional Chapter for UK and Ireland; the PRME Working Group on Gender Equality; the Centre of Social and Environmental Accounting Research; and the British Academy of Management Sustainable and Responsible Business Special Interest Group. Together we bring together a new network of researchers.

This proposal answers the invitation to engage with business and policy contained in the 'Architecture' document and it is structured in such a way that will stimulate research with business stakeholders in the priority areas identified in the document as falling within poverty reduction, education, gender equality, health, food, water and energy, social stability, infrastructure, technology, and governance. 

Each seminar will take as its theme one of these areas identified in the 'Architecture' document, and aligned with the interests of at least one of the Investigators in this bid. It is intended that each seminar, from seminar 3 onwards, will also include a paper which will be the result of direct research undertaken with UNGC member companies to enhance relevance and potential impact, and demonstrate the advantages in this respect, of the co-production of knowledge. The ICAEW has agreed to publish for each seminar, a briefing document, and following each seminar, a monograph and a practitioner summary for dissemination. Academic journal articles are also anticipated from each seminar, and a book to offer the combined contributions and debates is also planned.

The theme of each seminar will be circulated well in advance of the date of delivery to as wide a range of stakeholders as can be identified but including the networks associated with the investigators in this proposal. At least two academic research papers will be prepared in advance and a response sought from business/practice. A debate will follow. In the afternoon, selected papers from PhD students who have been invited to submit papers for presentation will be made with replies from respondents, both academic and practitioner. This is designed to further new research capacity in the topic areas and enable the development of PhD students and ECRs. A further paper presentation will be made and following a panel debate a reflective summary will be given on relevance and future directions for research.

There is also an international dimension to the series, with the inclusion of a seminar in Ireland, drawing on Irish networks and businesses, and a seminar at Kedge Business School, France, building on an existing 'Research Chair' engaging UN Compact companies in Europe investigating new business models.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Taking as its departure point the call to engage business, civil society networks, policymakers and academia in a process to facilitate a movement towards a fairer and more sustainable future, outlined by the 'Architects of a Better World: Building the Post-2015 Business Engagement Architecture', published by the United Nations Global Compact, the range of interested parties in, and beneficiaries of, this research exercise is extremely wide. The series will address a number of issues relating to sustainable development relating to the UN's post-2015 goals. By focusing on private sector involvement in aspects of poverty, health, resources, governance, women's empowerment and equality, education and technology, this series will engage many stakeholders in government departments, NGOs, the professions and charities, as well as academia, in exploring ways to facilitate changes in attitudes, behaviour and policy. Having the support of the UNGC UK Network in the project allows a level of confidence that as the events unfold, the level of awareness among policymakers, business leaders and third sector organisations will be maintained. 

Members companies of the UNGC UK Network will also be invited to participate in programmes of research focusing on the themes of the seminars and the results of the research presented as part of the series as it unfolds (from the third seminar onwards).

The format of the seminars is designed to encourage stakeholder engagement from within these groups from the outset, by making their contribution to each event, as respondents to the academic presentations, central to the ethos of the seminars, and thereafter by opening up each session to debate with contributions from the floor. Each seminar has space for presentations from PhD students and early career researchers to evidence some of the range of research topics that are under investigation by research students at our business schools and universities. 

Two of the seminars will be held outside the UK, one in Ireland and the other in France, to draw on networks of researchers with strands of research already developing in connected areas, enabling the reach of the impact to relate to companies, NGOs and academics within wider areas of Europe.

Additionally, with the backing and financial support from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in the form of publicity and publications, a briefing document will be prepared in advance of each seminar. Thereafter, a stand-alone periodical, comprising a summary of each presentation and response, in language designed to appeal and be of relevance to practitioners and non-academic stakeholders, will be published and distributed to members of all the networks, along with a 'professional briefing' specifically for ICAEW members. With members of the ICAEW holding high office across many institutions in the UK and abroad, the reach of this initiative will be extended as far as possible. Press releases will be made to the financial press in the UK, and abroad where appropriate.

It is the intention of the investigators that research undertaken in the three years duration of the series will make a significant contribution to the call made in the 'Architecture' document, and has the potential to shape behavioural change in many aspects of business, and promote the co-creation of knowledge in the spheres of business, third sector activity and departmental policy at a government level.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30488</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The award is for a seminar series on the role of business and business schools in addressing the challenges arising from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
