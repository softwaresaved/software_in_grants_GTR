By generating practical tools, supporting capacity, and increasing research demand and awareness, this research aims to influence the behaviour of decision-makers in order to support pro-poor eco-system services policy-making in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
It uses evidence synthesis, evidence mapping and systematic review methodologies to provide answers for policy and practice across the region. The first step set out in the research will be to understand the nature and extent of the evidence-base generated by the ESPA programme in relation to eco-system services in LMICs, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa. We will go on to search comprehensively for research evidence from the region to produce a systematic evidence map. This will be the basis for a user-friendly evidence interface to enable an active dialogue between decision-makers in government, NGOs, and researchers. This evidence interface will be tailored to inform decision-making in a policy context and allow policy-makers to critically interrogate the gaps and policy-relevance of the existing research evidence. We will launch the evidence interface at a high-level meeting of senior African environmental policy-makers, the International Biodiversity Research and Evidence Indaba. As a result of this stakeholder engagement, we will agree four demand-driven syntheses, which will then be produced during the remainder of the project. 
These four pieces of more focused work will synthesise evidence to answer four specific questions in the region as prioritized by our government partners. These have been preliminarily scoped with government colleagues as follows, but will be refined in consultation with stakeholders: i) what works in the management of ecosystems services in drylands in the region, ii) how best to provide effective governance of ecosystems services in low income countries, iii) what guidelines and decision-making tools are available to support decision-makers and do these include multiple dimensional measures of poverty? and iv) how can research methodologies be better aligned to decision-makers' needs? 
We will engage in an active process of co-production with government colleagues to answer research questions (iii) and (iv). That is, these two evidence syntheses will be produced by an active collaboration between the research team and government colleagues. This will include direct mentoring, applied learning, and on-demand capacity-building. It will allow us to not just synthesise insights on decision-making tools and applied research methods; but to also adapt and develop new decision-making tools and to enhance policy-makers' understanding and appraisal of the existing evidence-base. The project will therefore leave eco-system service policy-makers in Sub-Saharan Africa with two tangible tools to support their decision-making. The first tool refers to the evidence interface, while the second refers to the jointly-produced (or adapted) decision-making tool, which is assumed to be more policy-relevant and by design of the synthesis will pay particular attention to multi-dimensional poverty measures. 
This work will be led from the University of Johannesburg by their Evidence to Action team, with support from specialists in evidence synthesis (at University College London's EPPI-Centre), from international leaders in understanding multi-dimensional poverty in Africa (from the Southern Africa Social Poverty Research Institute - SASPRI), and from specialists in eco-systems services (including the South African National Biodiversity Institute - SANBI). Last but certainly not least, this proposal has been driven by colleagues from South Africa's national Department for Environmental Affairs, and their recognised priorities across the region.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research aims to increase the use of research evidence by eco-system service policy-makers in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The research framework approaches eco-system service evidence from a policy-maker perspective. This is reflected in the demand-led approach to the conducted evidence syntheses, the active process of co-production to generate these syntheses, and the tangible tools produced by these syntheses (the evidence interface and the policy-relevant decision-making tool). The direct audience for this research is eco-system service policy-makers in SSA, in particular policy-makers across LMICs in the region. We are working closely with the national IPBES focal point for South Africa and the Departmental coordinator of the IPBES Technical Support Unit for Africa. The findings of this project will feed directly into the South African national agenda, as well as the SSA policy arena. By generating practical tools, supporting capacity, and increasing research demand and awareness, this research aims to influence the decision-making behaviour of these individuals in order to support pro-poor eco-system services policy-making in SSA. 
This research applies an explicit behaviour change framework to conceptualise outcomes and activities required to support policy-makers' behaviour change. The proposed project aims to influence policy-makers' i) capability to use evidence; ii) awareness of and demand to use evidence; iii) opportunity to use evidence; and iv) relationship and network-building between policy-makers and researchers. To these ends the project will engage in a process of co-production, which entails mentoring, collaboration and applied learning as well as on-demand capacity-building. The evidence interface will provide institutional capacity and increase policy-makers' understanding of the eco-system services evidence-base. As policy-makers critically interrogate this evidence-base, they will support a definition of what constitutes policy-relevant eco-systems evidence and the role of policy-makers in ensuring this type of evidence is produced and available to inform their decision-making. This evidence interface will be user-friendly, visually engaging and interactive to ensure it is an active form of access to the evidence (rather than passive access as in research-driven databases). These activities to enhance access to evidence will be complemented by an evidence-informed dissemination strategy to communicate the main research findings. 
The importance of relationships and networks between policy-makers and researchers is key. The proposed research is embedded within strong existing research to policy networks and will draw from these relationships throughout. The research is supported by South Africa's national government departments for Environmental Affairs and for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation and is linked with the IPBES Technical Support Unit for Africa. These relationships will facilitate the presentation of the evidence interface at a high-profile gathering of senior African environmental policy-makers and ensure the produced syntheses are demand-led. As a Southern-led research programme, this project is ideally positioned to strengthen the existing networks and facilitate policy-makers and research interaction in a manner that allows for the increased exchange and application of policy-relevant research evidence. 
In sum, this research aims to support SSA eco-system policy-makers to make evidence-informed policy decisions that are of relevance to the needs of people depending on eco-system services for their livelihoods. It does so by supporting policy-makers capability to use evidence; by producing policy-relevant evidence in a demand-led process; by increasing decision-makers awareness, demand, and ownership of eco-system services evidence; and by actively facilitating decision-making behaviour change by producing two tangible tools owned by and tailored for SSA policy-makers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>177063</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P008127/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>63F3D26F-05D5-477D-9F77-C6C8AC47C7DD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Research approaches</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A2961412-FA64-4331-A882-DA219AC99567</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social policy and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F354373F-6BF5-4763-845E-4A4681AE3A8F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AF20B57E-E40B-45BC-85C8-DDC6F4777697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Spatial Planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
