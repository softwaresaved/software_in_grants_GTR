Because most people are &amp;quot;mestizos&amp;quot; (mixed race) and mixture is often seen as the essence of national identity, clear racial boundaries are blurred, resulting in comparatively low levels of racial segregation and a traditionally low public profile for issues of race. In Europe and the United States, the racial mixture and interaction across racial boundaries, which are typical of Latin America and are becoming more visible elsewhere, are heralded by some observers as leading towards a 'post-racial' reality, where anti-racism and multiculturalism - seen in this view as divisive policies that accentuate social differences - become unnecessary. Critics point out that mixture is not an antidote to racial inequality and racism in Latin America: they all coexist. This severely qualifies claims that mixture can lead to a 'post-racial' era. 

This project will investigate anti-racist practices and ideologies in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. The project will contribute to conceptualising and addressing problems of racism, racial inequality and anti-racism in the region. We also propose that Latin America presents new opportunities for thinking about racism and anti-racism in a 'post-racial' world. Understanding how racism and anti-racism are conceived and practised in Latin America - in contexts in which mixture is pervasive - can help us to understand how to think about racism and anti-racism in other regions of the world, where notions of race have been changing in some respects towards Latin American patterns. It is also crucial to show the variety of ways in which mixture operates and co-exists with racism in Latin America - a region that is far from homogeneous.

Research teams in each country, working with a range of organisations concerned with racism and discrimination, will explore how the organisations conceptualise and address key problems, which are becoming more salient in other regions, which confront similar scenarios. First, how to practice anti-racism when most people are mixed and when they may deny the importance of race and racism and themselves be both victims and the perpetrators of racism. Second, how to conceptualise and practice anti-racism when &amp;quot;culture&amp;quot; seems to be the dominant discourse for talking about difference, but when physical difference (skin colour, hair type, etc.) remain powerful but often unacknowledged signs that move people to discriminate. Third, how to understand racism and combat it when race and class coincide to a great extent and make it easy to deny that race and racism are important factors. Fourth, how to make sure anti-racism addresses gender difference effectively, in a context in which mixture between white men and non-white women has been seen as the founding act of the nation. Fifth, how to pursue anti-racism when it is often claimed that there is little overt racist violence and that this is evidence of racial tolerance. We will explore how these elements structure - and may constrain - ideas about (anti-)racism within institutions, organisations and everyday practice. 

Our project will work with organisations in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico - countries that capture a good range of the region's diversity - to explore how racism and anti-racism are conceptualised and addressed in state and non-state circles, in legislation and the media, and in a variety of campaigns and projects. We aim to strengthen anti-racist practice in Latin America by feeding back our findings and by helping build networks; and to provide useful insights for understanding racism and anti-racism within and outside the region.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The non-academic beneficiaries of this research will include social activists, human rights organisations, media professionals, educators, civil servants and policy-makers interested in engaging with anti-racist practice, mainly in Latin America but also beyond. In Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, these audiences will include:

- Activists in indigenous and black social movements 
- Civil servants and policy-makers in government departments charged with addressing anti-racism and anti-discrimination agendas and attending to the rights of ethnic minorities; these may include officials involved in the juridical branch of government, who deal with the legal dimensions of racism.
- National and international NGOs and networks addressing themes of anti-racism and anti-discrimination and campaigning for the rights of ethnic minorities.
- Journalists interested in issues of racial inequality.
- Educators interested in issues of anti-racism (likely to he be phrased as a matter of &amp;quot;diversity and equality&amp;quot;), who may be charged with delivering curricula attuned to these issues
- Members of the general public interested in these themes.

These audiences will be engaged by means of the project workshops, which will have a component to open to the public; the project website, which will include short videos and on-line versions of pamphlets directed an non-academic audiences; and the national launch event. The Advisory Groups are an important means of creating impact, directly by including activist members, working in NGOs and civic society associations and indirectly by tapping into their own wide networks; the non-academic members of the AGs are Emigdio Cuesta (Conferencia Nacional de Organizaciones Afrocolombianas, Colombia), Israel Reyes Larrea (Colectivo Africa A.C., Mexico), Arian Laguna (Observatorio del Racismo, Bolivia), and Sueli Carneiro (Geled&amp;eacute;s Instituto da Mulher Negra, Brazil).

Outside Latin America, we aim to engage with a similar range of beneficiaries, bt in a less intensive way, by inviting selected people to the final symposium, sending out relevant publications and by means of advertising the project website.

The research will benefit these sets of people in Latin America and beyond by providing detailed information on anti-racist activities in a wide range of contexts in different countries; by highlighting the different strategies the various organisations use to address the obstacles facing effective anti-racist action; and by stimulating debate on what anti-racism is as a concept and practice. We anticipate that the project's reach across four Latin American countries with very different histories, demographics and politics will prove very interesting for these beneficiaries, plus allowing some of them, directly involved in the project, the opportunity to enhance their transnational networks and their engagement with academics. 

We think that the Latin American material will prove of interest to people interested in promoting anti-racism in other regions of the world. For example, recent cases of alleged racism on the football pitch involving Latin American players, raised issues about cultural differences in the understanding of race and racism and whether it was appropriate to judge all behaviour by a single standard. The UK's Football Association sought the expert opinion of the UK-COI on a matter of this kind, indicating the interest of this organisation - not to mention the press and many fans writing in football blogs - in understanding anti-racism in a global perspective.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>828413</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N012747/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FC4405D9-8A0D-41F9-B71A-A19C9CD0AEFA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnicity</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
