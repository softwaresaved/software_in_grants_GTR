the substance and legacy of Labour Government efforts to transform British Africa policy and relations between 1997 and 2010. Through seven thematic seminars and an end of series briefing in the House of Commons, the series will bring together leading and early career scholars from across International Development, Politics and History, along with partners in non-academic and policy communities, including Chatham House, Institute for Public Policy Research and the All Party Parliamentary Group on Africa.&lt;br />&lt;br />Through these events, the series traces how UK Africa policy changed under Labour, considering how this relationship reflects national concerns, such as political party identities and public image, as well as international ones, including relative UK position on a global stage. It also brings this analysis into the contemporary context by exploring how UK Africa relations post-2010 are managed, presented and justified under conditions of financial austerity, coalition government and increased public scrutiny that resulted from ring-fencing aid budgets. Through the seminars and outputs the series will therefore provide the first in depth examination of contemporary Africa policy, establishing a new cross-disciplinary research network around this important area of UK foreign policy and domestic politics.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The seminar series will produce and disseminate a detailed and evidence based assessment of the legacy of Labour government for British Africa policy and explore how the experiences of coalition Government and financial austerity in the UK have impacted UK-Africa relations. The research presented during the series will therefore be valuable to a range of non-academic audiences:

1. UK Government Ministries, Political Parties &amp;amp; Cross Party Groups
In a UK political context likely to be defined by a financial austerity into the foreseeable future, the focus of this series on how this affects British Africa policy is highly relevant. Ministries that will benefit from this review include the two with primary responsibility for Africa policy, DFID, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, both of which have agreed to send representatives to the seminars. The three main political parties will also benefit from our exploration of processes of compromise and cooperation between coalition parties and of how Africa policy fits into their party identities. Across parties, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Africa, with over 150 members across parliament, is interested in our findings on trends in UK Africa relations beyond the period covered in current literature (largely pre-2005) and the APPG Chair has agreed to host a briefing in parliament on this issue.
 
2. Policy research, advocacy &amp;amp; campaign organisations in the UK
This encompasses think-tanks including Chatham House and the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), both seminar hosts. It also includes large professional associations with non academic members such as the Royal African Society, African Studies Association and Royal Geographical Society. Drawing on networks established by Prof. Harrison (CI), the series will also benefit organisations including Make Poverty History, War on Want and World Development Movement, which can draw upon the systematic and thematic analysis of key drivers of contemporary UK Africa policy to inform their engagement with UK Government and public awareness/advocacy campaigns.

3. African Governments and Institutions.
The focus of the series on Africa means the discussions and outputs will have relevance to the African policy community, particularly those who are members of the Commonwealth. By inviting representatives from African embassies and African research institutes to the seminars the series will promote ties between UK researchers and their home institutions and those in Africa, such as the British Institute in Eastern Africa and Rift Valley Institute, with which PI and CIs (especially Anderson, former BIEA Director) have existing links.

4. Media covering international affairs.
The series will have a proactive, ongoing media engagement strategy, focusing on outlets that cover Africa including print media (Guardian, Times, Telegraph), news weeklies (Economist, New Internationalist) and those devoted to Africa (BBC Focus on Africa, New African), as well as radio (BBC R4/World Service) and television (Newsnight, C4 News). Representatives from such outlets regularly attend events held at two of our hosts - Chatham House and IPPR. The series will engage media by inviting attendance at seminars and via written outputs (executive summaries, press releases) and social media updates on not only the seminars in isolation but also emerging news items relevant to the series. This will contribute to better informed media coverage of UK-Africa relations and raise the series' profile.

5. The general public.
The series will seek to engage the public in debates on UK-Africa relations through a communication strategy drawing on strengths and networks of the seminar hosts, especially Chatham House and IPPR. The series will raise awareness of key issues on current and future UK-Africa policy to elevate and inform public debate, aided by engagement with NGOs, civil society and social movements (see 'Pathways to Impact').</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26956</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Podcasts of the presentations from the seminars, where presenters have given permission for these to be made public.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0CD4C44E-04D9-45A5-8E68-619E191DA14A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The accessing of these podcasts has led to contact between prospective PhD students and the series PI.

However, the research has also suggested that whilst Africa continues to be an important area for UK engagement, it has become more similar to other regions insofar as there is no one 'Africa policy'. Instead UK national and strategic interests are being differentiated in relation to specific states and regions, making the definition of an 'Africa policy' difficult.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research suggests that a more nuanced approach is necessary, for example studies of the bilateral relationships between the UK and particular states, such as Nigeria and Kenya. It also suggests that there is much more to be done to understand Conservative Party thinking on Africa, this is an area which the PI is now actively researching. Finally, the research has highlighted the need for greater engagement by British politics and foreign policy scholars with UK Africa policy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0304106B-9FC1-456B-AE1C-1CF9763EC209</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/bisa-africa/uk-africa-policy/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Written evidence by interim PI for Int Dev Select Committee Inquiry on DFID allocation of resources</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>37DAB876-D772-47DD-9BBB-71AF25B4C54C</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/dfids-allocation-of-resources/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation by interim PI in FCO Challenge Session on UK Africa policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4BF864A4-F1DB-4471-8B75-6B0F8799CBFB</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Organisation of and presentation at Foreign and Commonwealth Office 'Africa Research Day' 2017</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0440B1EA-8EB7-4530-9D40-50CCB6E16FC7</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000725/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>69128365-74B2-4A08-8067-57863ECCB013</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>African Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F3195E9A-0130-4B4F-925D-90E851C3BF63</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Foreign Policy Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
