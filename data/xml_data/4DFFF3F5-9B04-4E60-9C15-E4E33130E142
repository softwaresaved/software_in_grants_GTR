This is especially important for people with learning disabilities&amp;quot; (Lord Rix, 2005, President of Mencap). 
The experience of handling artworks, as Lord Rix makes clear, enormously enhances our understanding of cultural heritage, and this is especially so for those with learning disabilities. For this social group, hands-on experience of cultural objects has in recent years become an important approach in promoting an understanding of cultural heritage as highlighted by the Access to Heritage Forum, and in response many museums and heritage sites have established 'handling collections'. Yet there are many drawbacks. The materials made accessible to those with learning disabilities as substitutes for the originals are usually chosen by the curators rather than determined by the user-group; many materials are deemed by curators too delicate to be handled by the user group; and in some heritage sites access to the objects is limited because of the complex nature of the site's environment, and their character is sometimes limited to pictures in books. 

This project aims to address this problem in three ways. One is to create a series of interactive, multisensory objects that replicate or respond to artworks of other objects of cultural significance in our national collections. These artistic responses to existing artworks might include for example a replica that has a screen or speaker embedded in it which responds to light or movement, triggering a recording of an oral history, or a series of photos from the archives to appear on the screen, or perhaps a recreation of a physical experience - such as the vibration felt when ploughing a field or even the smell of wet straw. A second - especially innovative - is to employ people with learning disabilities as participant researchers in generating and designing these art objects, so that they cater for a wide and yet targeted range of needs. The third is to explore techniques for developing interactive sensory objects, focussing on iterative design through participant workshops, with a view to developing best practice guidelines which can provide a basis for future development and provide a lasting resource for museums and heritage sites to support them in engaging with user groups.

The project will consist of a series of workshops that are fundamentally experimental and exploratory in character. In each, the academic research team will work together with the participant researchers with learning disabilities to develop interactive art objects, and in so doing record their successes and failures. The academic researchers will use their own expertise as artists and technologists in guiding the exploration to allow it to achieve its creative and interactive potential. In particular the investigators will explore the potential of newly developed easy-to-use electronics in making the experience of members of the user-group more vital and meaningful. In planning the project the investigators have secured the collaboration of three different heritage collections, one national - The British Museum - and two regional - the National Trust House, Speke Hall, in Liverpool and the Museum of English Rural Life (MERL) at the University of Reading.

The project is timely as &amp;quot;the heritage sector is waking up to the benefits of using technology in creative ways and making the usability as easy and intuitive as possible,&amp;quot; (Heather J. L. Smith, Head of Access for All, The National Trust, 2009).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research promotes greater access to museum and heritage collections for people with learning disabilities. The key beneficiaries include people with learning disabilities, heritage sites and their visitors. 

People with learning disabilities, in particular the members of the Access to Heritage Forum, The Tower Group London and user groups local to Museum of English Rural Life, Reading, will be engaged in the project as participant researchers, active members of the research process. They will take part in the design prototyping of the sensory interface objects, acting as experts and consultants in their disability. Through the inclusive design methodology of the workshops, the groups are encouraged to experiment, tryout and feedback their own opinions, rather than passively receiving what researchers think they need to access heritage, which was a negative experience voiced by some members of the Access to Heritage Forum. This opportunity to be a researcher for accessibility provision can be an empowering experience for a group whose opinion can often be overlooked or misrepresented.

In addition to the participant researchers, a wider group of people with disabilities will also benefit from better access to museum collections. For example wheelchair users will have new ways to access objects that are currently inaccessible to them, as is the case at Speke Hall where, due to listed building regulations, installation of lifts is not possible. The project will support visitors to make their own connections between how they live now and their relation to the past and the future. This ability to experience objects physically triggering media in museums and heritage sites, where you are often not allowed to touch the objects in the collection, presents exciting new opportunities for visitors.

Museums and heritage sites both nationally and internationally will be able to improve the visitor experience; the project will generate ideas for displays with heightened sensory interaction and good accessibility. Educators and designers of museums and heritage sites will be able to consult case studies from each museum to support them in adopting good practice in running inclusive workshops and providing accessible heritage displays in their own sites. 

The sites will also benefit from guidance on alternative ways to engage people with learning disabilities acting as consultants, which will help them gain a real understanding of the needs of this group of visitors. This should help museums and heritage sites improve their service provision for people with learning disabilities, with the potential to influence policies on widening participation, for example in documents such as The Museums, Libraries and Archive Council's 'Outcomes Framework'. The three sites that are directly involved in this project will benefit from the new handling collections developed during the project, which will be left at the sites so that they are available to museum visitors after the project has ended.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>465673</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>ArtLab developed from the Sensory Objects Project with Tina O'Connell from the University of Reading and is concerned with how we make the most of young peoples future's, by bringing a wide range of children from across different social backgrounds to Art.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E8BDD69A-C2A4-42C8-ADEE-0865EDF2B76C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Children's Christmas Lecture 2016 with ArtLab

In the original project we aimed to leave a set of objects at each museum to improve their accessibility, but we learnt through the project that the most valuable and influential resource that we brought into this sector through our approach was the proactive interaction of people with learning disabilities with museum professionals and the public in creative and reflective co-production activity. The sensory objects we constructed served as tools for engagement.
The multisensory and multimedia production processes we applied to the design, development, refinement and dissemination of Sensory Objects provided opportunities for cultural sites that were groundbreaking. The genuinely inclusive nature of the project teams, the workshop design and focus-group models that they demonstrated and the calibre of the intellectual dialogue that they afforded for Museum and Archive sites proved to be transformational.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4D7D1902-7989-446A-A440-47D17367489A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sensoryobjects.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/482017B3-5BCA-469E-A94B-9A855F152286"><gtr:id>482017B3-5BCA-469E-A94B-9A855F152286</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interactive Sensory Objects for Access to Heritage</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of BCS HCI 2012 - People and Computers XXVI</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c9f9a79e6f727511b233ec91483f91a9"><gtr:id>c9f9a79e6f727511b233ec91483f91a9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>N.
