&lt;p>The research will in particular focus on irregularities in Village Court practice, including the hearing of cases outside of their jurisdiction, the hearing of cases by authorities other than appointed Village Court magistrates, and the participation of so-called 'bush lawyers', self-educated but otherwise unqualified advocates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project is a collaboration between scholars in the anthropology of law in the United Kingdom and Australia, and will also include the participation of Papua New Guinean researchers. All researchers will document the practices of Village Courts in different regions of this highly diverse country, with the aim of counteracting a political rhetoric that the Village Courts are failing with actual evidence of the ways in which ordinary Papua New Guinean people have maintained and developed a system of justice and dispute management that works for them in the absence of state involvement or support.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will serve the interests of three groups of stakeholders: in Papua New Guinea itself, in Australia, and in jurisdictions further afield (including the United Kingdom) in which there is an interest in restorative justice.

In Papua New Guinea, two government bodies - the Village Courts Secretariat and the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission - will be the most immediate beneficiaries of this research. Both entities are based in the national capital of Port Moresby, and are staffed by the educated elites of the country. As such they have difficulty ascertaining what is actually happening in the Village Courts, especially those that are quite far from urban centres. The Village Courts Secretariat does not have the capacity to conduct research of this kind, and would benefit from the findings of this project in order to fine-tune its oversight of the system. The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission is concerned more broadly with developing the 'underlying law' of the country, which is popularly conceived as originating in the customs and legal consciousness of the grassroots - in practical terms, this means the Village Courts.

In Australia, entities concerned with the political and social stability of Papua New Guinea will be the main beneficiaries of the project. These will include academic bodies such as the State, Society and Governance in Melanesia centre in the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the Australian National University, and government bodies such as AusAID. Papua New Guinea is the single largest recipient of overseas aid from Australia, and there is periodic discussion in both the media and in policy circles that this aid has had little effect on supporting the institutions of civil society or 'law and order' in the country. This project would be able to provide AusAID and other sources of development funding - such as World Vision International - with concrete data on local legal practices that will in turn help them to fine-tune their funding priorities.

Finally, there is increasing interest among other Commonwealth jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada in exploring and instituting restorative justice practices as an alternative to, or side by side with, more formal legal remedies for criminal cases and others involving conflict of some kind. In the United Kingdom, the Restorative Justice Consortium would be the primary beneficiary of the research. This organisation serves as a clearinghouse for restorative justice initiatives throughout the UK, and would be among the longer-term beneficiaries of the project. We aim to share our research findings with the Consortium and its constituent members in order to discuss and disseminate the lessons learned over the last 35 years by what is essentially an early experiment in restorative justice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147940</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>World Bank Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>World Bank</gtr:department><gtr:description>World Bank project on domestic violence in PNG</gtr:description><gtr:id>CAC72582-AA79-4EDB-9E71-91D2274CB4AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs yet.

The main findings of the project included:

1. The Village Court connects local people and communities to a broader concept of a national collective, through mediation of the institutions of state, and drawing from the authority of the state in local institutions. The VC in each locale appears to be an amalgam of state definition and local integration of transitional institutions.The VC programme has made important contributions to political nation building since Independence in 1975 that go well beyond its more focal contributions to the development of justice and rights in PNG. PNG at Independence faced the very difficult task of unifying the many hundreds of heterogenous societies divided by geography, hundreds of languages, social and cultural norms. The VC is one of the few institutions of state-building taken up with enthusiasm and maintained throughout the country, often in the absence of any substantive state support or oversight.

2. The interacting relationships between Rights and Justice draw on the potentialities of the Village Court. Justice underlies broad and varied interpretations of people exercising agency in specific local contexts. When interpretations are in conflict or contested vis a vis the rights exercised or violated in a particular context, legal practice is invoked to resolve the situation. The VC serves as an interface between the formal institutions of the state and the traditional institutions of local communities, and, more importantly, provides a common platform that both invokes the different traditional institutions across different local communities, and provides a common space within which these traditions have authority beyond their local group. In particular, there has been a widespread assumption in the donor community that where 'traditional values' are in play in the context of the court, women disputants lose out. We found no evidence to support this assumption in any of our field studies. To the contrary, we found that women disputants were as skilled and agentive at invoking traditional sources of moral authority as their male counterparts.

3. The Village Court contributes to local agency and resolution of heterogeneity of practice. An operational definition of agency was developed to make clear the flows of agency through options, opportunity and choice. Although participation can be coerced, within the process in most examples there is the prospect, and often opportunities, to engage in other kinds of mediation to resolve the issue. Even when proceedings remain in the VC, this is often by choice. So the VC is helps provide enactable options to participants, which may include not only magistrates and named disputants but also any member of the community with a stake in the outcome of a case. In this sense the VC is arguably one of the the most democratic state instruments operating in the country - and by the same token is subject to a high degree of local inflection and the exercise of choice between forums. To exercise these choices however some form of joint agreement must be made. The flow of a case can be marked by the induction of these opportunities and how the different parties play against this sequence.

4. The Village Court is a vehicle for a cluster of shared symbols exchanged indirectly within and between increasingly heterogenous communities through linked through adoption of the VC as an institution. As such, the VC has a role in organisation and situationally resolving heterogenous perceptions through local application of indirectly shared values associated with the VC. While specific events and actions can be analysed based on direct relations between individual people, this places serious constraints on accounting for organising collaborative activity and relationships at community scales which are artefacts of thought more than action. We found that the VC, in addition to its practical utility and rough conformance to state specifications, was also an organising concept which acted as a base for associating different symbols, logic and values between locations, increasing the extent to which people of different regions assumed commonality through perceived similarity and connection. In short, where processes are context sensitive, the features of the context must be at least in part inferred or anticipated from behavioural indices/outcomes of organisation rather than simply observed. In particular, where productions are infrastructure for others, rather than simply signs individual productions and actions are needed for others to build upon in order to generate a societal resolution or response to an event.

Has the project met the objectives in the proposal: Yes.

Taking the findings forward:

We are actively presenting the research to stakeholders involved in policy relating to legal development in PNG, including the PNG law and justice sector and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with an aim to present the positive aspects of the courts' development over the past 40 years as elements to encourage and maintain. This work is beneficial at the policy level as it directly relates to the Papua New Guinea National Law and Justice Policy and Plan of Action: Towards Restorative Justice. It provides useful feedback to the PNG Department of Justice and Attorney General and the Law and Justice sector. NGOs with similar interests such a Peace Foundation Melanesia, can use our evidence and analysis to motivate their own projects. The theoretical and methodological contributions relating to agency have broad potentials to advance academic work on agency, and reconciling agencies when these come into conflict. Practical applications of this work include design of new policy and programme planning for local development. 

An international project in development between Demian and Sari Wastell at Goldsmiths concerns concepts of 'everyday justice' as they are brought to bear on social relationships both within and externally to the institutions of the state.

The elements of the project relating to agency, justice and rights are being taken forward in a new proposal, with James Fraser of the University of Lancaster as principle investigator, in a project aiming to leverage these in influencing the planning and implementation of a new 'Green Revolution&amp;quot; in Mozambique. Although not relating exclusively to the justice system in particular, we believe that leveraging relationships between these elements is critical to resolving injustices of the past and implementing a future that will be more equitable. To this end we have also initiated discussions with the Overseas Development Institute on the broader implications of our project for policy on local-level justice initiatives elsewhere in the Commonwealth.

The work has also found application in areas outside social research, particularly work by Fischer relating to understanding how agency, justice and rights relate to non-standard social arrangements including 'smart' machines, such as those underlying the development of the Internet of Things, and those taking roles as active agents interacting with people, such as self-driving automobiles and service robots. A proposal has been made to the EU as a part of a consortium aiming to develop 'social' middleware for service robots that will leverage the results of this research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are actively presenting the research to groups involved in policy relating to the Village Court in PNG, with an aim to present the positive aspects of its development over the past 40 years as elements to encourage and maintain.
