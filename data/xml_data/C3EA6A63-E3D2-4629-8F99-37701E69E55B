warm the air fed into ASHP (Air Source Heat Pumps)

Pre-feasibility modelling indicates that by using solar air collectors to pre-heat the air supply to specially optimised ASHPs
we will be able to increase the efficiency of ASHPs to the extent that 1) the carbon emissions (per kWh of heat) from their
use will be significantly lower than the emissions associated with energy efficient gas boilers and 2) the cost of heat will
(within the 2020s) become lower than that from efficient gas boilers.
The findings could therefore lead to a step-change in the competitiveness of ASHPs relative to gas boilers. This will
accelerate the mainstream deployment of ASHPs in the UK, initially within new build housing and new commercial
buildings and subsequently into the existing UK building stock.

The project will specifically investigate:
Appraisal of system design options
Development of a detailed thermodynamic system design model and demand-side model(s),
Formulation of control and modulation strategies
Investigation into optimisation of system components (with particular attention to working fluids, fluid flow rates, heat
exchanger and controller)
Calculation of theoretical system performance in different climates and undertaking of cost benefit and benchmarking
analysis.

This project will contribute towards addressing the UK's energy trilemma by reducing emissions by leading to a supply of
renewable heat with lower carbon emissions than mains gas and of renewable cooling with significantly lower emissions
than electricity powered compressor-based cooling systems; improving security of supply by significantly reducing demand
for fossil fuels; and reducing cost by providing a high-efficiency ASHP capable of generating heat (for space heating, water
heating and cooling) at a lower cost than both mains gas and other renewable energy/&amp;quot;clean energy&amp;quot; options.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>London South Bank University (LSBU) will be working with Energy Transitions Ltd (who are the lead organisation) on this
project. As this is an Innovate UK funded competition, the research LSBU will undertake for Energy Transitions will consist
of a number of feasibility studies into the novel proposal of using solar collectors integrated in to buildings to pre-heat the
air used by Air Source Heat Pumps

The project has the potential to develop a world-leading solution capable of achieving substantial sales within the
developing renewable heating and cooling markets across Europe, Asia and North America. The UK has existing ASHP
and solar air collector industries and the capacity to grow these to meet the opportunities that our innovative system will
create both in UK and overseas markets.

This project is well timed: firstly the EU's Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires that all new buildings in the
EU are 'nearly zero energy' from 2020 and many other countries around the world, including China and the US, also have
policies to build low carbon buildings; and secondly this innovative system can make a substantial contribution to meeting
the UK's carbon budgets in the 2020s and beyond.

Thus, this British company and its clients will benefit in a number of ways and the company success will drive economic
growth and create new jobs within the UK construction and building services industries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>61254</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>still working on the project</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>too early to say</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>39CE63FF-1D17-478C-AA0F-4EA8EBDCF916</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P016146/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1175C1D0-52DD-4F11-A1B8-E080CABC3609</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar Technology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
