However, it is also common that this resource is underutilised because of the way the data holdings are organised and because of difficulties in accessing them. These problems are most common in the GSOs of developing countries.

A well managed and readily available geoscience information resource is a key component of a poverty alleviation strategy in a developing nation. This is because such information can contribute to development in the following ways: 
 - Clean water supplies from unpolluted groundwater resources improve health and release the economic potential of women who no longer spend their days carrying water to meet their domestic needs;
 - Identifies primary mineral resources which can be exploited as part of a wealth generation strategy, by providing raw materials for export or indigenous production; and
 - Identification of natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, flooding or naturally occurring toxic substances.

The British Geological Survey (BGS) has been designing and building geosciences databases for several decades. We now have a wealth of mature and well documented designs. We have a reputation for excellence in this area and are contacted by other GSOs and industry for copies of our designs. However, this is presently an ad hoc process which requires an awareness of BGS' skills and knowledge that we do share our designs at no cost.

It is our aim to provide an initial resource of open, ready to use database designs that will be available to all on a public website. We will also build a self sustaining community which will develop these designs and add additional designs to meet the needs of the wider environmental community.

In order to achieve our goals we proposed a two year project to carry out the following activities:
 1. Create a web based resource hosted by the BGS which contains downloadable Database Design Packages.
 2. Build a community of interested parties to maximise the uptake of the downloadable Database Design Packages and exchange ideas on good data management practices within geoscience.
 3. Develop a strategy to ensure community sustainability and ensure that a web based resource is maintained long after the project ends.

It is anticipated that the primary application of the data model packages would be by GSOs creating new databases to hold geoscientific data or used as templates to compare their current designs against. 

The data model packages would all conform to NERC Standards, so by adopting elements of the data models end users would inherently be aligning themselves with the same high standards. The adoption of common internationally accredited standards promotes good data management practice and could facilitate future data sharing and system integration opportunities.

We expect the project to produce the following benefits:
 - More GSOs will have access to huigh quality geoscience database designs, which should lead to greater use of such designs
 - Greater opportunity for environmental modelling because improved data infrastructure
 - Greater opportunity to re-purpose data or create commercially valuable derived data products
 - Increasing the usefulness of data through centralised descriptions of the meaning and inter-relationships of the information
 - Increase the time spent on adding value to and interpreting data by making it easier and quicker to find and access data
 - New long lasting multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional partnerships will be formed which should lead to future collaborative research &amp;amp; funding opportunities</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>89488</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Malawi</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Malawi, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development</gtr:department><gtr:description>Malawi Surveys Department - spatial metadata knowledge exchange</gtr:description><gtr:id>0C2BEBD4-4BD8-4F9E-9512-FE6228E58B48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Month long training course to commence in April 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Department of Surveys have coordinated the management of a spatial data portal - MASDAP and have agreed to oversee the implementation of a spatial metadata entry function based upon recommendations made by the OpenGeoscience Data Models team.

The visit was primarily based in Lilongwe and Blantyre, with appointments at institutions such as the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Surveys Department.
There are a large number of projects run by government, commercial organisations and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) in the country that involve the capture and storage of spatial data, methods vary from organisation to organisation. There is a high regard for GIS expertise in the country and plenty of well trained and keen practitioners, there is also a significant number of researchers and decision makers who are interested in finding out what spatial datasets exist within the country. Unfortunately there appear to be a large number of datasets that could have national significance but remain hidden on individual laptops, often held in spreadsheets and GIS files that are well understood by the authors but poorly documented, raising the risk of data being lost or misunderstood by future potential users.
The June visit lead to a subsequent visit in February 2014 which was more technical in nature and was very much focussed on supporting the work being carried out by the Department of Surveys. 
One shining example of how spatial data management could be improved in Malawi, and perhaps other low income countries, is http://www.MASDAP.mw. This system provides an online portal for the upload, search and download of spatial datasets, its development is funded by the World Bank programme for Disaster Risk Management. 

The Department of Surveys are in the process of creating a National Spatial Data Centre for the country, they will host and administer the MASDAP system and are in the process of developing national standards for the capture and storage of spatial data. 

The MASDAP system is a powerful tool for capturing and storing spatial data, however, it is only possible to capture metadata when a user is uploading a dataset. Many data owners are willing to tell others what data they possess but strongly resist 'giving it away'. We came up with a plan to encourage the capture and use of spatial metadata through a series of changes to the existing system and by arranging data management and data modelling training in the UK and Malawi. The BGS data model for spatial metadata and information workflows were presented and used to inform discussions on future developments.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Conference -  Sharing the most valuable database designs in African geology</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B8CB2BDE-A1AE-4F86-BEE4-8E3C08342141</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation was given and a booth was set up for the week from which demonstrations of data models were given and a survey was conducted to assess which subjects were of most value to conference delegates.

Initially these were referred to as data model downloads packages but it became apparent that the vast majority of potential users were non-database experts and therefore did not necessarily understand the specialised field of data modelling, but they did understand that databases required an underlying design. 
The downloads were made up of relational data models in the form of entity relations (ER) diagrams, plain English documents (available in MS Word and PDF to maximise access), implementation scripts, example data and links to associated dictionary data sources.
The BGS staff on the project produced four full database design packages and a further three are in progress, which, will be released regardless of the knowledge exchange project formally coming to an end. 
The BGS produced downloads were complemented by a number of designs made available by project partners and associated organisations, these were hosted on the information providers website and links provided on EarthDataModels.org model library.

Knowledge exchange communications with project partners took place regularly and has continued after the project officially ended. Special technical and community building visits helped to cement relationships between community members whilst presentations at international conferences raised awareness of the project aims and outputs.
By the end of the three years the project team had delivered on each of the stated objectives, had produced two separate web resources, one branded as part of the popular BGS website and another designed as an independent community website. A large amount of plain English documentation was produced and data model designs were all made available for free download via the two project websites.
New contacts and knowledge exchange relationships were established and have already lead to new collaborations that would not have happened without the project taking place.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Lesson Learnt

LL1: When working with developing countries there is a real danger that the security situation can change rapidly and travel plans which seemed reasonable in the planning phase of a long running-project may become impossible within months. Consider alternatives and have, at least high level, back up plans in place.
LL2: Creating and maintain a new community discussion forum takes a lot of time and effort from a setup and administration point of view, if such a facility is justified then it is possibly better to create a group within an existing social media platform, such as LinkedIn or Google Groups.
LL3: Building a community without making funds available to all parties for the travel and expenses required to carry out the necessary face to face contacts seriously limits the effectiveness of the community.

Conclusions:

C1: Geological Surveys around the world face similar challenges and produce similar data models
C2: Face to face communication produces better outputs and stronger relationships/networks than remote methods
C3: Many of the experiences developed within organisations such as the BGS are directly relevant to organisations responsible for the management of spatial data, not just those involved in the geosciences.
C4: As with C3, above, there are a few organisations, such as BGS, who could share a wealth of experience with regards to producing commercial outputs by deriving digital products from well structured data.
C5: The project team delivered on each of the stated objectives, however, efforts to address the following objective were limited: &amp;quot;Contribute to the ongoing efforts to ensure water security&amp;quot;. Despite providing links to relevant existing public data models on EarthDataModels.org the project team did not contribute a new design, this was due to the priorities identified by our project partners during the mid to latter phases of the project.

Recommendations:

R1: Future project plans for similar initiatives should include contingency for disruption to travel plans due to security concerns, especially for countries which are identified through the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Travel advice service as being prone to high levels of crime or potential for terrorism threats, even if the situation appears calm during the project planning phase.
R2: Future publically funded projects which involve the creation of geoscientific databases should include adequate resources to produce public versions of the underlying data models used or produced.
R3: There are enough organisations actively engaged in geoscience data modelling to justify a workshop or dedicated session at an international geoscience conference.
R4: Use the most appropriate branding for dissemination of public knowledge and if necessary use more than one communication channel, tailoring each to the intended audience. The EarthDataModels.org website was deliberately 'Open' and community branded, rather than BGS branded. This worked well when attempting to encourage technically sophisticated project partners and others to contribute material as these contributors tended to have their own strong brands which they were happy to associate with a project initiative rather than appear to be part of a another 'rival' brand. However, there were certain other organisations that were encouraged to take part because the project was lead by a well respected organisation, these tended to be the less technically developed institutions such as the GSOs in sub-Saharan Africa.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C6EA3CA6-6EAE-4804-A59C-F330E1154076</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.EarthDataModels.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The downloads were made up of relational data models in the form of entity relations (ER) diagrams, plain English documents (available in MS Word and PDF to maximise access), implementation scripts, example data and links to associated dictionary data sources.</gtr:description><gtr:id>755E1E1E-BF06-4F86-9214-F39CA266EB6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A decision was taken to increase the uptake of the downloads created by removing barriers on access, use or tracking therefore it is not possible to quantify impacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Database Design Downloads -
