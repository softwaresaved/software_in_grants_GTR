Certain phenomena have the same effect, including heat, which causes objects to expand. A well-known example of this phenomenon is the bimetallic strip, a flat plate formed by attaching two metal strips together, one more expansible than the other. On the application of heat, the strip bends in the direction of the less-expansible strip, due to the mismatch in expansion. This propensity to bend is an example of a control field that may be programmed into the material. One could, for instance, consider making one or both layers variable in thickness, meaning that the degree of bending experienced at each location in the strip would be different. The natural question to ask is how the control field should be chosen in order to produce the desired shape in the strip. The present proposal introduces a general-purpose algorithm for such problems in arbitrary geometries. The method is not limited to thermal expansion mismatch as above; here a control field refers to any non-elastic effect that couples with elasticity to create a shape change, including piezoelectric coupling and shape memory effects, among others.

The mathematical problem to be solved is a PDE-constrained optimisation, in which a certain function is to be minimised by varying the displacement field and control field in the elastic body, subject to the constraint that the displacement field solves the elastic equations describing the object's deformation. Developing this approach into a functional algorithm requires the resolution of several issues, which will necessitate the synthesis of techniques from elasticity theory, optimisation theory, and image processing. Perhaps most important is the choice of objective function, i.e. what function is to be minimised? One would like the shape of the deformed object to be as close as possible to a target shape, so the proposed choice is to use the target shape to set up a distance function in the computational domain, which can be used to determine the distance of each point on the elastic object to the nearest point on the target. This particular formulation has advantageous properties for the numerical calculation of the optimisation problem. The proposal also requires the determination of the most appropriate numerical method for solving the problem, which is inherently nonlinear, thus making it a non-trivial one to solve.

Experimental restrictions lead to a further objective. Typically, optimisation problems need to be regularised in order to make them mathematically well-behaved. The usual choice is Tikhonov regularisation, which results in control fields that vary as smoothly as possible over the domain. Smooth control fields, however, are naturally difficult to program into an elastic object; it's much more straightforward to manufacture a control field which is piecewise constant over the domain, by gluing components with different (constant) properties together. Mathematically, this is achieved by appealing to total variational regularisation.

The final goal of the proposal is to seek configurations which are multiply-stable, rather than simply one shape. For instance, a metal ruler fixed at both ends and heated will expand and buckle either up or down. More complicated multistable configurations can be found by more complicated control fields or object geometries, and the proposal seeks to find the practical issues involved in their calculation.

Finally the aspects discussed above will be brought together with the practical example of a composite plate whose fibre-reinforced layers can be oriented to produce a control field sufficient to cause multistable configurations. The algorithm developed in this proposal will find the fibre configurations sufficient to cause a predetermined multistable configuration, which will be experimentally investigated to validate the approach of this proposal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Composite materials comprise an industry sector that has grown significantly over the last few years, and has been identified as a critical growth opportunity for the UK. In 2010 composites manufacturing represented a market worth &amp;pound;2.3 billion to the UK economy, which has the potential to grow to &amp;pound;12 billion by 2030.

The present proposal has identified a direct application to this growing industry. The particular area of application, namely thin structures able to undergo large deformations, is an area where commercialisation is inhibited by the lack of specific software aimed at shape-change-driven design. Knowing in advance how to configure the composite material in order to attain a desired shape - whether this is to avoid warped shapes or to realise bistable shapes - would be a useful tool for designers and manufacturers of thin composite sheets and would speed their introduction in applications.

Morphing composites are a novel application of composite materials that are being actively researched for a number of promising uses, including aeroplane wing design, wind turbine blade design, and improvements in automobile aerodynamics. This experimental technology has been implemented largely in small-scale or prototype applications; thus the full economic impact has yet to be realised. The promise of this technology for wider-scale use can only be achieved by being able to design structures for specific applications, and the present proposal aims to be a critical part of this programme.

Many applications of morphing composites are grounded in improved aerodynamic efficiency. Furthermore, a greater reliance on composites in aircraft reduces the vehicle's weight. Both of these factors reduce fuel costs for the vehicle operator, with potentially large reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Climate change is overwhelmingly regarded as the greatest medium-term challenge facing humanity. Floods already cause around &amp;pound;1 billion per year to the UK, and with a 4C rate warming the number of affected properties could rise from 860,000 today to 1.9 million by the 2050s.

Further applications of this general procedure are anticipated in the longer term. One potential application is in mechanically-active tissue engineering, where scaffolds are required that undergo large deformations during cell culture, such as cardiovascular applications. It is desirable that the scaffold attain the shape of the fully-developed organ under the imposition of biologically-relevant stress fields, and this may be controlled by programming the scaffold properties, such as its anisotropy and density. A method such as that proposed here has the potential to significantly enhance the properties of such engineered scaffolds, with knock-on benefits to health outcomes in the wider society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95564</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P021891/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CFBD6626-50CB-4AA6-8B49-9A76519BA91F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Numerical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
