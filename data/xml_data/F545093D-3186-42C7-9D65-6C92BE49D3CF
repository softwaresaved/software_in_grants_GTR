N. Ireland is the region of the UK most at risk from Brexit. Like Scotland, a majority voted to remain in the EU. This project is a collaboration between the Law Schools in Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University and the region's principal human rights organisation, the Committee on the Administration of Justice. It is designed to disentangle the legal elements of Brexit with regard to N. Ireland and to communicate the related policy and practice implications in user-friendly formats. The audiences to be addressed include parliamentarians and policymakers in NI, Britain, EU and the ROI, as well as wider civil society. We will focus on two broad and closely inter-connected areas (i) issues related to the constitutional position of N. Ireland and the process of conflict transformation and (ii) questions related to the protection of human rights and equality. One practical lesson gleaned from previous work is that policy development risks irrelevance if prepared in a vacuum that does not take account of legislative realities. To address that need, Greenberg (parliamentary draftsperson consultant) will provide practical legislative advice on all outputs, including discussions on identifying delivery opportunities and obstacles and where necessary, specific legislative provisions. 

The EU has provided practical, financial and political support as well as essential legal protections for post-conflict N. Ireland. The constitutional arrangements in the Good Friday Agreement assumed common EU membership. Brexit risks arousing tensions around the land border and citizenship that have been moderated by EU membership. More generally, many view departure from the EU as having energised a culture of intolerance and disrespect, seen in the language of 'taking back control' (focused on immigration), and calls to repeal the Human Rights Act. The collapse of the N. Ireland Assembly in Jan 2017 renders the need for user-friendly non-partisan legal and policy advice on complex matters related to N. Ireland and Brexit all the more compelling. 

AIM &amp;amp; OBJECTIVES

The aim is to provide clear legally informed policy advice with regard to six key challenges. 

The objectives are:

1. To analyse the impact of Brexit on (a) the constitutional position of N. Ireland and the process of conflict transformation and (b) human rights and equality. 
2. To review the legal, academic and policy literature.
3. To interview legal, political and policy actors in Belfast, London, Dublin and Brussels. 
4. To hold 20-30 bilateral meetings across civil society. 
5. To co-ordinate 6 town hall meetings.
6. To write 6 reports (20p max, with 3p executive brief), detailing the legal, political and legislative implications of Brexit and:
- the peace process
- North-south relations
- border controls and free movement in and between N. Ireland, the Republic and Britain
- xenophobia and racism 
- socio-economic rights (especially employment rights)
- wider human rights and equality issues
7. To develop an ambitious media strategy
8. To develop an online and social media presence
9. To share the research at four public events in Belfast, Dublin, London and Brussels
10. To produce at least two scholarly outputs 

POTENTIAL APPLICATION AND BENEFITS

The project will identify the constitutional, legal, human rights and equality aspects of Brexit for N. Ireland, the relevant obligations and the options for going forward. It will provide user-friendly advice on legal and legislative challenges and thus help inform the choices to be made. It will provide clarity on the underpinning assumptions of the Good Friday Agreement with particular reference to equality and human rights. The website will host reports, blogs, and thus provide an essential resource for civil society and policymakers. These insights will be shared through online, print and social media, complemented by conferences in Belfast, London, Dublin and Brussels.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. This is an initiative designed by academics from the Law Schools at both universities and the leading independent human rights organisation in N. Ireland (QUB-UU-CAJ). The project will assess systematically the impact of Brexit and provide clarification regarding its precise consequences. 

2. The project will produce a series of six bespoke policy reports (20 page max, with three page executive brief), detailing the legal, political and legislative implications of Brexit for N. Ireland: Brexit and the peace process; Brexit and North-south relations; Brexit, border controls and free movement in and between N. Ireland, the Republic and Britain; Brexit, xenophobia and racism; Brexit and socio-economic rights (especially employment rights); Brexit and wider human rights and equality issues (including LGBTQ rights, anti-sectarianism, gender equality, children's rights).

3. A parliamentary draftsperson Daniel Greenberg will provide practical legislative advice on all policy-related work. In practice, this means that the proposed six policy outputs will include discussions on identifying delivery opportunities and obstacles and, where necessary, specific legislative provisions. 

4. 20-30 bilateral meetings will be held with a wide range of stakeholders across civic society in N. Ireland. 

5. A series of six town hall meetings will be held in N. Ireland targeted at local civil and political society. 

6. The team will complete at least a dozen TV and radio interviews, four op ed pieces in leading print outlets and six online blogs over the course of the project.

7. The team will develop and implement an online and social media strategy including a project website and bespoke twitter account. QUB have agreed to host and maintain this for at least five years following the close of the project. 

8. To team will disseminate the project findings at a major project conference in Belfast - as well as further satellite events in Dublin, London and Brussels. 

9. The primary beneficiaries of this project will be the UK and Irish Governments; political parties in N. Ireland and the Republic (the project is supported by the Irish Government - see attachment letter); as well as civil servants and policy stakeholders in the EU, UK, N. Ireland and the Republic. The secondary beneficiaries will be civil society, human rights and equality groups and the trade union movement and employers and the business sector (e.g. regarding free movement of workers, employment law). 

10. The project team has well-established and productive working relations with relevant officials in London, Dublin and Belfast, with individual Ministers and with political parties and individual politicians. Work produced by team members is widely regarded as authoritative and is respected. The project team is therefore well placed to advance this research and to achieve the stated impacts. 

11. This is a collaborative project designed to maximise reach into N. Ireland civil society. CAJ is the leading independent human rights NGO in Northern Ireland which has won several major human rights prizes including the Council of Europe Human Rights Prize. CAJ co-convenes (with Unison) the Equality Coalition of 80 human rights and equality organisations.

12. Harvey, McEvoy, O'Connell, Gormally and Holder have extensive experience of public engagement and media work. Members of CAJ staff will be seconded to the research team both to contribute to the legal analysis and to assist in the engagement, advocacy and knowledge dissemination work. All of the impact case studies submitted by QUB and UU Law were graded 4* in REF 2014 (including those involving members of the current team).

13. The project team will work closely with Prof. Menon and colleagues to ensure maximum coordination with other projects funded by the current initiative.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>237202</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R001499/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A4CA3E5-9CDA-4B38-9C9E-5F8023D4603E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>EU Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>10601309-838E-4D0F-A4EE-B765E0CB1A81</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
