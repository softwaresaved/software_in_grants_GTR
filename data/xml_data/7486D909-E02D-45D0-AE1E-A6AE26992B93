Engineering Applications</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J017086/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Joining of dissimilar metallic materials for advanced structural applications, e.g. car body, ship structures, medical appliances etc., is important for design flexibility. This will allow complementary characteristics of different metals to be exploited efficiently and therefore, will allow design engineers to push existing design boundaries for cost effective manufacturing of components. To realise the full potential it is vital to device energy efficient joining of such dissimilar metallic components. Welding is a simple and robust joining technique but the heat of welding will cause interfacial reactions between the participating alloys by triggering diffusion of atoms across the interface. This will result in formation of intermetallic compounds which would make the joint brittle and unserviceable. Therefore, development of welding processes for joining of dissimilar alloy combinations can play an important role in shaping next generation component architecture and transform manufacturing sector. 
Laser fusion welding has the unique advantage of controlling the heat input and high resolution in applying the heat source. Therefore, laser fusion process offers the flexibility to control the weld pool shape and therefore mixing of the participating alloys. The proposed research programme aims at formulating robust and transformational laser joining technology for joining of different dissimilar metallic material combinations. A fundamental scientific approach will be deployed by systematically identifying and understanding the key underpinning process factors that determine the metallurgical characteristics and mechanical strength of a joint.
Three different dissimilar alloy combinations will be studied in the proposed research programme viz. iron-aluminium, titanium-stainless steel and nitinol-stainless steel. The dissimilar alloy combinations are chosen based on relevance to different industrial sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Successful development of laser fusion welding for dissimilar metallic materials will have impact in multi-direction. It will push the existing boundaries of component design by allowing the design engineers to optimise architecture of structural components. On the other hand it will also bring a transformational change in the manufacturing processes for production of components of complex design and for critical applications. Successful completion of the project will have a positive impact in the economy, academia and society as a whole. 
In the current global financial climate, manufacturing has been clearly identified as one of the extremely important and obvious sector which can be reliably depended on to generate resources which will stimulate growth. 
Welding of dissimilar alloys is timely. The automotive sector is set to increase its aluminium usage as structural material from the current average of 140 kg to almost 250 kg per vehicle by 2025. This drive is entirely based on practical issues e.g. carbon footprint and high uncertainty in oil prices. Lowering of vehicle weight will improve durability, lower carbon emission and make it more affordable to drive. Similarly in aerospace industry there is requirement to join Al to Ti and between different alloys of aluminium. These two industries have an annual turnover of more than &amp;pound;31bn, employ more than 600,000 people directly and in supply chain. Similarly in ship and boat industries there is a continuous thrust to use more aluminium as structural material. However, the joining process is not cost effective and also the resulting structure is not mass efficient. Ship building and repairing industries, including both commercial and naval, have an annual turnover of &amp;pound;4.6bn and employs 60000 people. Both these industrial sectors have contributed significantly towards the UK economy and will continue to do in foreseeable future. The outcome from the proposed research will reinforce the international leading statusf UK manufacturing in these sectors. 
Medicine is the other target sector for this research. Joining of Ti based alloys to stainless steel will create new generation of cost effective surgical implants e.g. stents. The medical OEM (original equipment manufacturers) sector also has a very strong growth potential with an estimated market of more than a billion USD. However, development of joining principles between Ti based alloys and stainless steel will go far beyond medical applications into energy and aerospace sectors. 
A robust plan to disseminate the research findings has also been proposed through organisation of a number of industry days and by creating a web portal for further outreach.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100221</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Materials Manchester</gtr:department><gtr:description>Centre for Innovative Manufacturing for Laser Based Production Processes</gtr:description><gtr:id>1CB10EF6-7C53-4DD4-B262-2CABD4FEBA7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The partnership is in place in the form of a platform research grant and joining of dissimilar alloys was identified as one of the flagship research theme.

The unique advantage of using laser is the flexibility that it offers in terms of application of heat and thereby controlling the welding thermal cycle and the resulting metallurgical structure. Joining of chemically different alloys is difficult not only due to the difference in their physical properties but also due to the formation of detrimental intermetallic phases owing to the lack of solubility between the two alloys. Formation of hard intermetallic compounds severely reduces joint strength and toughness.
Two different dissimilar structural alloy combinations were investigated. The different combinations, titanium (Ti) to stainless steel (Fe) and aluminium (Al) to steel (Fe), are selected based on their application potential in energy and surface transportation sector. 
Joining of thick sections of Al (5 mm) to Fe (2 mm) in autogenous mode, i.e. without addition of any other intermediate alloy, was attempted on the understanding that Al has some solubility in steel. However, Fe does not have any solubility in Al and therefore, joint formation critically depends on the thermal cycle and the resulting weld metal dimension and intermetallic formation. Thermal cycle in laser joining depends on the application of heat energy which is dependent governed by the product of power density, time of application (also known as interaction time) and area over which the power is applied. They are termed as the fundamental material interaction parameters. In this programme, each of these parameters was individually varied to see its effect on weld pool dimension and intermetallic formation. It was observed that the mechanical strength is critically dependent on the weld pool dimension and thickness of intermetallic layer in the interface of the joint. Larger the weld pool width better is the strength and thicker the intermetallic layer lower is the strength. In observing the individual effect of the fundamental material interaction parameters it was found that while power density tends to increase the weld pool width and thereby load bearing ability, increase in interaction time at a constant power density, contributes towards the growth of intermetallic layer. This understanding was exploited in creating joint which did not show brittle failure and the joining configuration developed was exploited to demonstrate possibility of design modification for a structural application in surface ship systems. A joint prototype was manufactured which will be tested.
Joining of stainless steel to titanium was carried out in 2 mm thick sections. Unlike the previous combination, Fe and Ti show no solid solubility and therefore, it was impossible to join them without adding a third alloy as interlayer. In this project we termed it as weld metal engineering. In this project it was found that there is no common metallic species which can bond with both iron and titanium without forming any intermetallic phase. Therefore, weld metal engineering was required with more than two alloys where each alloy is metallurgically compatible with either of the participating alloy and with each other. Nb and Cu have been identified as the interlayer where Nb exhibits good solid solubility with Ti and Cu with Fe and they can form good metallurgical binding amongst themselves. However, precaution needs to be taken to prevent diffusion of Ti and Fe within a common weld pool. A novel approach was proposed where Nb and Cu inserts will be produced by arc welding using additive manufacture technology and then the apply laser to join Nb to Ti and stainless steel to Cu. Application of laser is vital to control the weld metal dimension within a very narrow margin to prevent diffusion. 
The research activity performed within this programme helped in developing the most vital understanding of heat source, material interaction and subsequent microstructure and metallurgical phase formations. Also the application of weld metal engineering was investigated at a substantial depth. 
Laser as a flexible heat source can be applied with high spatial and temporal resolution. This characteristic can be exploited in joining of dissimilar alloys which can bring substantial benefit to designer to create cost effective, design efficient structures with better carbon footprint.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has extremely high application potential. Since the inception, BAE Systems, AWE plc and Attica components were industrial partners and Manchester University supported through the LATEST2 platform grant. The research activities that were performed over the last two years not only generated greater understanding, knowledge and reinforced the underpinning science of dissimilar material joining, it also showed how design modifications and application of other advanced manufacturing tools e.g., wire and arc based additive layer manufacture methods can be deployed in creating innovative design for advanced structural applications. Joining of dissimilar and highly dissimilar metallic alloys is now a flagship research theme in the Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Laser Based Production Processes. AWE plc is interested in taking the project further through more direct research. The results of this project was disseminated to scientific communities through international conferences and to industrial community e.g. Association of industrial laser user through their annual conference Industrial Laser Application Symposium. The following ways would be helpful in taking the work forward;
Application:
- Direct industry sponsored programme project with a clear vision of application in specific components. There is a possibility of taking the work on joining of titanium to stainless steel further with support from AWE. A novel manufacturing route involving additive built inserts were proposed to exploit the findings further. 
- Exposing the work to other industrial community and encourage them to think about design modifications where the boundary of the existing design can be pushed by exploiting complimentary properties of different alloys to create more cost effect and design efficient structures. Industry day is being organised to achieve this.
Further research:
- Understanding the performance of a hybrid layered structure for different service environments, particularly in view of corrosive environment.
- Understanding elemental distribution in the intermetallic layer through neutron transmission imaging. This will help in more in-depth understanding of intermetallic formation with transient thermal cycles and its effect on mechanical properties. Thermal cycles could then be correlated to fundamental material interaction parameters 
- Application in ultra thin sections for electronic appliances using the state-of-the-art pulsed lasers with high frequency and low pulse energy</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>24B220FE-4579-4DBA-85E2-19AFB3469885</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Energy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Course content in Advanced Welding Processes</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>83399E27-3A27-4132-8ECF-37DD24E8AAE7</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>FE model of laser conduction welding process which would predict the thermal cycle and weld pool width near the interface of Fe to Al dissimilar combination</gtr:description><gtr:id>4570C9FE-95DB-45C6-89C6-BA5052C1A7A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The model helps in understanding of the fundamental material interaction parameters to the thermal cycle and weld pool dimension.
