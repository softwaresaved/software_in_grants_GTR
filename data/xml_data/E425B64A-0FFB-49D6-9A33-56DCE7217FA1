This change has come about largely through improved public hygiene, decreased child mortality and a decrease in infectious disease. However, the steady increases in the average age of the populations of developed countries have come at a terrible price: an ever-increasing burden of age-associated diseases, such as cardiovascular maladies, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, public health efforts that resulted in past increases in life expectancy have made it possible for people in developed nations to live long enough to experience one, or quite frequently several, of the degenerative and neoplastic diseases that have now become the dominant causes of death. Although a hallmark of the aging process is declining tissue function and homeostasis, the molecular basis of cell, tissue and organismal aging is still very poorly understood . This severely hinders efforts to develop therapies to combat debilitating age-associated pathologies. This application explores the basic mechanisms of cellular, tissue and organismal ageing. Specifically, we will test a reconciliation of three separate models or mechanisms of ageing. Two of these are well established as theories of ageing. According to the theory of cell 'senescence', ageing results from a finite proliferative capacity of cells, and hence their ultimate exhaustion and failure to renew. According to the theory of 'chromatin', ageing results from accumulated changes in the packaging of DNA into the cell nucleus. These theories are not mutually exclusive, but neither is satisfactory on its own. Recently, we have obtained evidence for a third theory. Specifically, that ageing results from a decline in activity of a pathway that is known to be required for tissue development and maintenance, the so-called 'Wnt signaling'pathway. Our preliminary data suggest that these three theories of ageing can be unified into a single 'Wnt-chromatin-senescence' signaling pathway which is a key determinant of ageing. The goal of this application is to test this novel hypothesis. We will test this hypothesis using a range of approaches, including cell culture, animal models, analysis of tissues from very old humans and baboons and state-of-the-art whole genome analysis. Progress on this project will enhance our understanding of degenerative age-associated diseases, and so facilitate development of therapies to combat these diseases and increase the quality of life in old age.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This application proposes to investigate the existence of a novel 'Wnt-Chromatin-Senescence' signaling axis as an important determinant of the ageing process. The Wnt pathway is an evolutionarily conserved determinant of tissue and organismal development and homeostasis. Several reports have shown that inherited genetic polymorphisms that result in reduced Wnt signaling are associated with accelerated onset of aging phenotypes such as heart disease, metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis and diabetes. These genetic data imply that elevated Wnt signaling might delay the aging process. Replicative cellular senescence was discovered and first described as an irreversible growth arrest triggered by the accumulation of a discrete number of cell divisions. Replicative senescence is likely to be of great importance for our understanding of the biology of ageing. Yet other studies have implicated changes in chromatin structure in the regulation of cellular senescence. For example, normal mammalian tissue ageing is associated with changes in chromatin structure. Thus, cellular senescence, Wnt signaling and epigenetic/chromatin changes are all implicated in the aging process, but the relationships between them are far from clear. Recently, the UK Lead Investigator, Peter D. Adams, has recently discovered that reduction of Wnt signaling triggers the formation of heterochromatin and senescence in vitro. Meanwhile, John M. Sedivy has discovered that many of the changes associated with senescence-associated heterochromatin formation in vitro are detectable in ageing tissues in vivo. Based on these results, we have hypothesized the existence of a Wnt-Chromatin-Senescence signaling pathway as a major determinant of the rate of aging. This application investigates this hypothesis through three Specific Aims.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The survival of populations in developed nations into extreme old age is a remarkable phenomenon in human history.

Although a hallmark of the ageing process is declining tissue function and homeostasis, the molecular basis of cell, tissue and organismal ageing is still very poorly understood. This severely hinders efforts to develop therapies to combat debilitating age-associated pathologies. Currently, there are several models proposed to explain the ageing process. According to the theory of cell senescence ageing results from a finite proliferative capacity of cells, and hence their ultimate exhaustion and failure to renew. According to another model, ageing results from accumulated changes chromatin structure in the cell nucleus. These theories are not mutually exclusive, but neither is satisfactory on its own. Recently, we have obtained evidence for another model. Specifically, that ageing results from a decline in activity of Wnt-signaling, a pathway that is known to be required for tissue development and homeostasis. This application tests a novel hypothesis of ageing. Specifically, that a signaling pathway based on Wnt, chromatin and senescence is an important determinant of ageing. Therefore, this work has the potential to unify three separate views of the ageing process into common model. This will lead to a more coherent understanding of the ageing process, and hence an enhanced ability to understand and combat age-associated pathologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>471846</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting lay public and donors for Glasgow Wolfson-Wohl Translational Cancer Research Center</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28BA9EC1-D2EC-49F1-864C-F6909912C230</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 20 people attended for a short presentation, discussion and bldg tour.
