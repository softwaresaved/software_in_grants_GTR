contemporary encounters with dead bodies.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M002071/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Encounters with dead bodies are becoming more commonplace in a range of socio-cultural, socio-economic, political, medical and emotional contexts. However, public understanding of, and academic research regarding, these encounters is limited and not very coherent. Changing social attitudes, new technologies, migration and multi-culturalism, medical demands and economic opportunities relating to dead bodies are changing rapidly. Migrant communities bring different demands in terms of claims on space connected to the rituals and practices of bodily disposal in the UK (eg. how are cemeteries organized, how can different burial practices be accommodated?). Social trends regarding the dead body are also changing. There is a strong class divergence with respect to viewing the body before burial, for example. Alternative choices of bodily disposal are also increasingly popular, such as different ways of disposing of funerary ashes or choices about forms of 'green' burial. Forms of artistic practice (eg. the &amp;quot;Bodyworlds&amp;quot; exhibition of plasticised human remains), archaeology (eg. Richard III's remains), popular culture (eg. TV forensic crime series) and tourism products (eg. 'dark tourism') and their media coverage have made human remains more visible in the everyday. The donation of bodies for medical research and the global trade in post-mortem body parts, combined with the growth of technologies that make these possible, also bring the dead body into play in contemporary social encounters which raise important questions about the regulation and management of biomedical material and the experience of relatives of the dead.

This series of meetings will thus bring together a wide range of researchers and practitioners with the aim of increasing understanding of these changing social trends related to managing, disposing of and presenting dead bodies. In each seminar a range of international academics and professionals involved in managing human remains will debate present-day societal, cultural, ethical and technological concerns related to the dead. The discussions will cover a wide range of contexts, from funerals to tourism, donating bodies for medical research to the economic trade in body parts, accommodating 'green' and faith-based requirements for burial, understanding the ethics of disturbing human remains (eg. in major infrastructure projects such as London Crossrail or HS2), to the use of dead bodies by political regimes. 

The seminars will also produce information for the various professionals and members of the public who encounter the dead in these contexts. A key outcome is to enhance understandings of social attitudes and practices with regard to the dead body in these situations and to explore the implications for policy-making and practice eg. how should churches, local authorities and cemetery managers use space to accommodate different faith groups, what kinds of new products might a manufacturer produce for the growing market in 'green' burials, how might a tourism company sensitively use human remains for economic gain? In all of these contexts and processes the seminars are also aimed at generating a better understanding of public attitudes in order to ensure that the dead are dealt with sensitively and in an ethical way.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The seminar series has considerable potential to achieve impact with a variety of research users. Non-academic participants will be a significant feature of each seminar, both in developing the focus of each seminar, contributing to the debates and co-producing material which will be made more widely available to non-academic audiences for longer-term impact through the 'Pathways to impact'. There are 3 key areas where it is possible to identify who will benefit from the seminar series and how:

1) understanding social, cultural, professional and faith-based differences in conceptualising the dead body (Seminars 1-3) - the seminar series will debate how the dead are conceptualised materially ('dead bodies'/'human remains'/'corpses'?), theologically (is the 'corpse' merely a container?), socially (eg. social class trends in viewing the deceased before burial, social attitudes to excavating archaeological remains) and culturally (eg. the demands of different faith and diaspora groups regarding how the dead are treated before and during burial). Practical knowledge will thus be co-produced with inter-faith groups, religious practitioners involved in burials, local councils and cemetery management reconciling the UK planning system with faith-based burial requirements, community archaeology projects, museums of natural history, transport bodies and planners, city planners and civil engineers. The seminars will co-produce understandings of how different social/cultural/professional/faith groups conceptualise the corpse and what the implications of this for managing and regulating such encounters.

2) managing and regulating the treatment and representation of human remains (Seminars 4-5) - human remains and their representation are increasingly present in contemporary political processes (eg. reburial of national figures in former communist Eastern Europe, photographic records of those killed by the Syrian regime) and in niche tourism products such as sites associated with 'dark tourism' eg. battlefield tourism, sites of atrocities). A range of political and commercial actors are thus increasingly having to respond to the issues associated with using the dead as political subjects or as commodified material suitable for economic exploitation. These include, in the former case, local and national governments (and those who may oppose them), the military, the church, and in the latter local and national tourism boards, commercial tourism companies, managers of heritage sites, and tour guides. The knowledge co-produced in the seminars will inform political strategies of using the dead as political subjects and opportunities to resist such constructions and also inform tourism and heritage practitioners about issues to consider when representing the dead in public or private-led tourism.

3) managing and regulating the materiality of the dead body (Seminars 6-8) - recent changes in social attitudes to the use of the body after death, combined with changing medical/commercial demand and new technologies, have led to the emergence of new situations in which there is a requirement for knowledge regarding how to manage and regulate how dead bodies are used and treated eg. how are body parts extracted and then maintained during global circuits of trade, what different technological and material innovations are required for containing and presenting the dead body during 'ecological' burials, the process of donating dead bodies to anatomy units. Here knowledge can disseminated regarding policy formation and legal aspects (eg. regulating trade in body parts), manufacturing techniques (eg. new forms of wrapping or burial caskets for 'green' burials), market information for commercial companies involved in 'ecological' burial, practice in medical laboratories, medical schools and anatomy units including dealing with relatives of the deceased and patient welfare groups, and local government.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30061</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Childhood Bereavement Network (CBN)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Child Bereavement UK - Hull Advisory Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>641296B9-3260-4517-82D0-6D36B77DFD91</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Quarterly meetings between educational and community organisations on local strategies for addressing child bereavement.

UCLan hosts dark tourism conference for global experts at former Lancaster prison.

The 'A Wing' of a former Lancaster prison provided the ideal backdrop this week for dark tourism experts from around the world to examine society's interest in sites of death and disaster.

Organised by the University of Central Lancashire's (UCLan) Institute for Dark Tourism Research, together with project partners from the Universities of Manchester Metropolitan, Bath, Durham, Hull, and York, the 'Packaging up Death and the Dead for the Contemporary Visitor Economy' conference invited speakers from the UK and USA to look at what makes people want to visit sites of death, disaster or the seemingly macabre; how appropriate this may be and if visiting some sites of so called dark or disaster tourism is insensitive and exploits those affected by them.

The event was aptly held at what is considered to be one of Lancashire's most iconic site of dark tourism, the former 'A Wing' of HM Lancaster Prison at Lancaster Castle.
The Executive Director of the UCLan Institute for Dark Tourism Research, Dr Philip Stone, organised the booked-up conference. He said: &amp;quot;Over the past twenty years or so there has been an increasing academic and media focus on 'dark tourism', which has the capacity to expand boundaries of the imagination and to provide the modern visitor with potentially life-changing points of shock.

&amp;quot;Dark tourism and cultural heritage overlap when considering themes of war, disaster, tragedy or social conflict, and memory and identity are in question. Of
course the interpretations of these themes are understandably prone to concerns about inclusion, exploitation, sensitivity and appropriateness. I would argue that developing touristic opportunities at particular difficult heritage sites is an increasing, and perhaps inevitable, feature of creating what is known as contemporary traumascapes; sites which bear the physical and psychological scars of suffering.&amp;quot;

Another UCLan speaker, Associate Lecturer in Tourism Management Dr Daniel Wright, shared his provocative research which paints a sombre scenario for the future of tourism in 2200 in which hunting humans could become a form of tourism entertainment.

He said: &amp;quot;What the future of tourism will look like is open to debate. Hunting humans: A future for tourism in 2200, is a research paper that explores past and current societal trends. What I've presented is a provocative dystopian future scenario where entertainment, violence and human assassination are seen to be a normalised tourist activity.&amp;quot;
Other topics examined Lancaster's own slave heritage and the ways that contemporary artists and academics ensure that history is not forgotten, the spectacle of punishment and prisons, and the appropriateness of children visiting sites of death and disaster.

Dr Stone added: &amp;quot;This conference was a huge success in the sense it brought local, national and international scholars, students, and industry people together from a broad array of subject areas. We encounter and commemorate death in many ways in contemporary society and the conference allowed us a critical insight of how 'dark tourism' can mediate life and living through the significant dead.&amp;quot;

'Packaging up Death and the Dead' for the Contemporary Visitor Economy: A Dark Tourism and Heritage Perspective, is part of the 'Encountering Corpses' project led by Professor Craig Young from Manchester Metropolitan University, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Seminar Series 2014 - 2017. Other speakers were Professor Mary Margaret Kerr from the University of Pittsburgh, Professor Alan Rice from UCLan, Dr Paul Fallon from Sheffield Hallam University and Dr Sarah Hodgkinson from University of Leicester.

Notes to editors

The University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) in Preston was founded in 1828 as the Institution for the Diffusion of Knowledge. Since those early days it has grown into one of the UK's largest universities with a staff and student community approaching 38,000 and an employment-focused course portfolio containing over 350 undergraduate programmes and nearly 250 postgraduate courses. The University has an established research reputation with world-leading or internationally excellent work taking place within the areas of Business, Health, Humanities and Science.

As a truly global institution with an established campus in Cyprus, UCLan's student body includes 120 nationalities and its partnership network extends to 125 countries. In 2013 the Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings awarded UCLan the full five stars for its global outlook in all aspects of international educational provision. In 2015 the Centre for World University Rankings placed UCLan in the top 3.8 percent of all worldwide universities.

The University has a strong focus on continually improving the student experience and recently unveiled a 10-year, &amp;pound;200 million plan to redevelop its Preston Campus to create an attractive and inviting, world-class campus helping to create jobs, kick-start regeneration and attract inward investment into the City.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Seminar 3: Encountering the Corpse - issues in academic and professional archaeology</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A672CEC4-D542-46B2-A126-E2996523241A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The third Research Seminar in the series was organised by Dr Ducan Sayer at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN), School of Forensic and Applied Sciences, 17-06-15. The speakers were a mixture of academics, industry professionals and undergraduate and postgraduate students (see below) and the audience was a mixture of academics, postgraduate students, theologians and industry professionals.

The speakers were: Dr Duncan Sayer (Archeology, UCLAN) Archaeology and excavating the dead; Quentin Carroll (Cambridgeshire County Council) Planning and archaeology: a perspective; Louise Loe (Oxford Archaeology, private sector) The osteoarchaeologist, excavation and analysis; Dr Bryan Sitch (Manchester Museum) The dead on display: a museum perspective; Allison Card (Forensic Science/Archaeology, UCLAN) Forensic science and archaeology.

The archaeology seminar combined a series of different perspectives focusing on the recovery, curation, storage and display of the ancient corpse in a modern cultural context. These perspectives included town and countryside planning concerns, museums, commercial archaeologists and research interests as well as the implications of legal, ethical and scientific agendas. The topics raised in discussion included the presentation of ancient bodies to the public, commercial encounters with the corpse, research interests in measuring, accessing and sampling skeletal remains and learning environments in which ancient bodies are encountered in laboratories or in the field. Our last two speakers were undergraduate and postgraduate research students who were asked to give short presentations about their own personal encounters with human remains. Lively discussion was had which cut across these professional divides and this session in particular benefited from the interdisciplinary dialogue created by the ESRC network partners. 

Key implications from the event included a broadening awareness of the heritage encounter for which there is limited knowledge more generally outside of the sector. The debate contributed an understanding about the breadth and depth of the archaeological encounter with the corpse and its implication for contemporary culture. The planning, curatorial and commercial archelogy sectors are under considerable stress at the moment because of governmental cuts, and a loss of confidence within museums so this session has become part of a wider subject discussion concerning the future of ancient corpses and their social and scientific importance.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dr Julie Seymour seminar presentation on 'Doing' and 'Displaying' Family.

Dr. Phil Olson, Virginia Tech University, USA, presenting A Corpse Divided: Undertaking Products, Refuse, and Resources.
Andreia de Sousa Martins, Ph.D. Student in the Centre for Death and Society and the University of Bath presenting Broadcasting Dead Bodies in Brazil.
 
The day's seminar focussed on how 'technology' is broadly defined when applied to the human corpse. The different speaks discussed ethics, the law, morality, and the future of dead body disposal technology. We had one international speaker, Dr. Phil Olson, from Virginia Tech University and one Postgraduate presenter, Andreia de Sousa Martins. Ph.D. students also helped organise and run the event. It was a sold-out seminar and 50 people attended.
 
The key outcomes for the seminar:
 
* Connecting Dr. Phil Olson with more research occurring in the UK for further research development between the UK and the US.
* Bringing the Centre for Ethics in Medicine at Bristol and the Centre for Death and Society together for further collaborative opportunities.
* A post-seminar networking event in the City of Bath for the day's attendees.
 
Public Engagement:
 
* Bringing the Bristol Museum team to the seminar to discuss the exhibition and research possibilities working with audience reactions to the exhibition.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Seminar 5: Dead body politics, materialities and mobilities</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>64BBE8D8-139A-43B2-A4D0-4D64CBF338A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 5th seminar in the series was held on 18th March 2016 at Manchester Metropolitan University on the theme of 'Dead body politics, materialities and mobilities'. It was organised by Professor Craig Young (School of Science and the Environment, Manchester Metropolitan University) and Dr Jon Shute (School of Law, University of Manchester).

The speakers were: 
Dr Jon Shute (Law, U. of Manchester) Journeys in Space and Time: Human Remains and the Srebrenica Massacres.
Dr Jean-Marc Dreyfus (History, U. of Manchester) Forgotten exhumations: the French mission in search of corpses from deportees in Germany, 1946-58.
Dr John Harries (School of Social and Political Science, University of Edinburgh) Repatriating Beothuk skulls and the affective politics of indigeneity.
Dr Gemma Angel (Institute of Advanced Studies, University College London) Mortal Remains: Confronting the Dead in the Medical Museum.
Dave Griffiths (Manchester School of Art, MMU), Michael Branthwaite (School of Art and Design, Staffordshire University) and Dr Caroline Sturdy Colls (Archaeology, Staffs.) Finding Treblinka: artistic responses to forensic evidence.

The seminar focused on the materialities and mobilities of human remains and how they underpinned complex processes of geopolitics, memory, affect and emotion. In each case the 'rediscovering' of parts of human bodies (cremation ash, skulls) and associated objects was associated with a complex geopolitics of (national) identity, post-conflict and post-colonial struggles for recognition and justice, or a national claim on bodily remains which required to be repatriated and claimed by different political communities, at the national or sub-national scales. Attention was also paid to the politics of representation and how artists could become involved in the display of human and other remains some sites of trauma, such as concentration camps. The seminar was also highly inter-disciplinary, integrating artists, lawyers, historians, social anthropologists, archaeologists, human geographers and death studies.

The speakers were: Colin Joseph, Sexton, Jewish Joint Burial Society, London, The ownership and management of Jewish burial grounds, and the theological beliefs underpinning Jewish funerary practice; Namakau Maambo, Project Leader, African Community Council for the Regions, Repatriation of bodies to Africa; Mohamed Omer, Board Member - External Affairs, Gardens of Peace Muslim Cemetery, London, The operational principles of the Gardens of Peace Muslim cemetery; Julie Dunk, Executive Officer, UK Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management, The legal framework for meeting diversity in burial need.

Each paper and the event as a whole featured audience debate reflecting on the different faith needs for the burial and treatment of the dead body of different ethnic/racial/faith groups in the UK.

The presentations and discussion led to a number of cross-cutting research outcomes and identification of key social and professional trends, notably: the intersection and sometimes contestation of gender and faith beliefs in bodily disposal practices and rituals; regulation - UK local authorities bound by UK legislation, but the needs of different faith groups raise issues within UK regulatory contexts, whether this is because of different burial requirements, issues around repatriating bodies internationally (eg. African community), or an increasing shortage of burial space (grave use forbidden in Islamic practice unless body has decomposed completely); industry implications - differing demands for cremation, implications for insurance markets and transportation industry eg. for repatriation of bodies; difference between religious requirements and cultural practices, especially among diasporic communities; different view of the corpse before burial; where is the ideal place for burial.

A Ministry of Justice official was also invited and attended underlining the importance of the seminar as an essential networking event, which was successful in bringing together a broad range of stakeholders.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prof. Craig Young, international conference presentation at the 12th Death, Dying and Disposal international conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A5EA24F-5084-4652-B605-0BDB7D826AB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof. Craig Young presented a paper on 'Exploring the geographies of burial at sea' at the 12th Death, Dying and Disposal international conference, Alba Iulia, Romania, Dec. 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.deathandsociety.org/pages/ddd12-conference.php</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Professor Craig Young Inaugural Lecture &quot;Making a place for the dead: developing inter-disciplinary perspectives on contemporary encounters with dead bodies&quot;, Manchester Metropolitan University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>188F71EF-F339-4EFC-B6EC-817DB32DF939</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Craig Young presented his Inaugural Lecture on the topic of &amp;quot;Making a place for the dead: developing inter-disciplinary perspectives on contemporary encounters with dead bodies&amp;quot; at Manchester Metropolitan University, September 2015.

It was organised by Dr Phil Stone, Institute of Dark Tourism Research, University of Central Lancashire. 

Invited speakers were from the UK and USA including: 
Professor Mary Margaret Kerr (University of Pittsburgh) - Overlooked Encounters with Death: Child Tourists at Dark Sites.
Dr Philip Stone (University of Central Lancashire) - 'A Commodification of Death' - Dark Tourism &amp;amp; Difficult Heritage.
Professor Alan Rice (University of Central Lancashire) - Lancaster's Slave Heritage and the work of Guerrilla Memorialisation.
Dr Paul Fallon (Sheffield Hallam University) - Co-creating Dark Tourism Experiences: A 'Heroes' Return Case.
Dr Sarah Hodgkinson (University of Leicester) - Haunting (Hi)stories of the English Gaol: Re-Imagining our Carceral Past.
Dr Daniel Wright (University of Central Lancashire) - 'Hunting Humans?' A Future for Tourism in the Year 2200.

The aim of the symposium was to critically explore fundamental interrelationships of touristic travel to sites of death or disaster with the cultural condition of society. Particularly, the symposium critically explored how death and the dead are 'packaged up' or commodified for the contemporary global visitor economy, and the implications and consequences thereof. 

The symposium closed with a lively audience Q&amp;amp;A session chaired by Professor Richard Sharpley (University of Central Lancashire). 67 delegates attended the event and originated from across the UK, Canada, Belgium, Germany, Spain, and Poland. Delegates were a mixture of academics, local government officials, museum practitioners, and postgraduate students. Each presentation examined a specific aspect of what has been broadly referred to as 'dark tourism'. Stone opened the symposium by giving a broad review of dark tourism and 'difficult heritage'. He outlined major issues around consuming mortality within contemporary memorialisation of the significant Other dead. Kerr offered insights into children experiences of visiting 9/11 memorials and how the young perceive both death and atrocity, as well as associated politics. Rice examined slavery heritage within the Lancasterian landscape, and how memorials to the enslaved dead are both linked to intellectual activism and to the broader visitor economy. Fallon explored how the military dead are encountered through battlefield tourism and, in particular, how familial pilgrimages are performed within tourism. Hodgkinson outlined how former prisons as visitor attractions trade on the supernatural as well offering a window for the penal gaze. Finally, Wright offered a provocative futureology approach and outlined how the (human) dead may become visitor attractions of tomorrow. Overall, the event brought major themes of how (significant) death and the dead are retailed and remembered through the tourist gaze. 

The event created local media coverage including in the regional press and local BBC radio.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.uclan.ac.uk/news/former-prison-is-fitting-setting-to-explore-death.php</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dr John Troyer took part in the film screening and public debate Watershed: Re-imagining Death in a Digital World: Soylent Green, Bristol Museum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9192788C-FA2B-478A-AAE2-35F38410E85C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr John Troyer (Project Co-I, Bath University) participated in a public debate following a screening of the flim 'Soylent Green' focusing on a discussion about the film and the current thinking about the future of death and the dead body.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.watershed.co.uk/whatson/7127/soylent-green-discussion</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dr John Troyer presented talk on &quot;Spectacular Dead Taxidermy&quot; in the Bristol Museum's Winter Lecture Series</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AEFA909C-7E77-475A-920A-43ED64F5A55B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr John Troyer (Project Co-I, Bath University) gave a tlak in the Bristol Museum's Winter Lecture Series on how nineteenth century preservation technologies radically changed and mechanically altered the dead animal body as well as the human corpse, producing new kinds of taxidermy, which draws directly on issues discussed in the Encountering Corpses Research Seminar Series.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/bristol-museum-and-art-gallery/whats-on/winter-lecture-spectacular-dead-taxidermy/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dr Duncan Sayer presented a seminar paper Ancient corpses and contemporary society; encounters with the (pre)historic dead</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>44843442-CE16-486A-87F6-3BE581EC422D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Duncan Sayer (Project Co-I) presented a seminar paper on 'Ancient corpses and contemporary society; encounters with the (pre)historic dead' at the Department of Archaeolgy, Anthropology and Sociology, Universit&amp;auml;t of Hamburg (November 2015) which drew directly on debates and issues raised in the Uclan 'Encountering Corpses' seminar.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Encountering Corpses&quot; project blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1243C91A-A52C-466D-A52D-1A105605EFBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An &amp;quot;Encountering Corpses&amp;quot; blog has been established on Wordpress.

The speakers were a mixture of academics and industry professionals (see below) and the audience was a mixture of academics, postgraduate students, theologians and industry professionals.

The speakers were: Bobby Hopkin-Hoggarth of Co-operative Funeral Care and member of the British Institute of Embalmers (&amp;quot;Care for families and loved ones&amp;quot;); Claudia Venhorst, Dept. of Comparative Religion, Radbout University, Holland (&amp;quot;The ritual cleansing of the deceased: how Muslims ritualise death in a migration context&amp;quot;); and Jenny Uzzell, Dept. Theology and Religious Studies, Durham University and owner of a Funeral Directors offering more 'bespoke' and non-traditional funerals (&amp;quot;An Accidental Vocation&amp;quot;).

Each paper and the event as a whole featured audience debate reflecting on the implications for how the corpse and the process of bodily disposal is viewed in these different contexts and how the corpse is encountered differently in each case.

The presentations and discussion led to a number of cross-cutting research outcomes and identification of key social and professional trends, notably: different attitudes towards and therefore approaches to dealing with the dead eg. in embalming or Muslim funerals; the gendering of the work (and professionalisation) of dealing with the dead body - who performs the (emotional) labour, how is that gendered, how does that intersect with eg. faith, what do people expect from professional situations (eg. male funerary professionals?), who makes decisions e.g.. within families; is there anything fixed or specific about the dead body - is it endlessly mutable according to context (eg. Islamic death rites but localised Muslim death ritual) especially the diasporic context? Lack of knowledge for local funeral industry about needs; the changing professionalisation of the death industry - who performs death work, who is expected to do so (gendered again), professionals without professional qualifications - need for licensing and regulation?; social trends and social class in bodily disposal.

The seminar lead to enagegment and potential further impact as it resulted in an enhanced relationship with Co-operative Funeral Care national and regional managers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dr John Troyer participated in Assisted Dying Panel Debate, Bristol Museum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C606C88-2152-4A4E-A8D7-5F97F9DF8F13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr John Troyer (Project Co-I, Bath University) incorporated ideas from the &amp;quot;Encountering Corpses&amp;quot; Research Seminar Series into a panel debate on Assisted Dying held at the Bristol Museum, 26-1-16.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/bristol-museum-and-art-gallery/whats-on/assisted-dying-panel-debate/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>250</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>British Sociological Association Support Fund (postgraduate fieldwork support)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Sociological Association (BSA)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>AAE115F3-8E2B-4A05-B6AD-0A33253245F5</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>800</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ESRC Festival of Social Sciences</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C4D38AF5-186F-472A-8686-D279697207CF</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>60000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of Hull Doctoral Scholarship Scheme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Hull</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>9DEB5EC4-AF30-457F-B97C-741859846269</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>800</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Academy of Medical Sciences INSPIRE</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7DB9901B-685B-41B7-9F23-4FC910DD7375</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1280</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Hull City of Culture Programme Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>9A0A80DF-34C6-48A9-A384-4C88C67C3977</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Research Seminar Series has lead to emerging areas of non-academic impact, particularly in the areas of:

1) Changes in/development of curatorial/museum practice:

Members of the research team have been involved in advisory panels and new partnerships with public sector organisations responsible for preparing and delivering major museum exhibitions relating to the dead body. Members of the research team have performed advisory roles in which they advised these organisations on issues to do with managing and displaying the dead body and human remains. This also informed museum practice in preparing displays for the general public and school groups and managing the encounter with the dead body.

2) Shaping professional practice in heritage management through training:

Members of the research team actively shaped professional practice among local authorities, heritage managers and museum curators by contributing to training workshops which developed skills in managing the handling and display of human remains.

3) Informing corporate strategy:

Members of the research team extended relationships with major corporate organisations involved in the funeral industry, advising them on public attitudes to preparing for death and bodily disposal which informed corporate strategy.

4) Informing current practice in child bereavement:

Members of the research team have been involved in a number of collaborations focused on shaping current practice in bereavement support in cases of child death. This has involved, for example, dissemination of research findings on death dying and bereavement to a range of organisations and the integration of local groups into research proposals. A range of types of organisations are involved, from major UK child bereavement charities to local hospices, child and youth organisations, local schools and university and bereavement organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EF275B3D-DFF6-4CF5-9C51-78CAAA5992F0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training workshops on 'Human Remains In Commercial Archaeology: Legal, Ethical and Curatorial Considerations'</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91CF651F-CAE9-483E-B469-18E6C4694486</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Sayer contributed to three training workshops on 'Human Remains In Commercial Archaeology: Legal, Ethical and Curatorial Considerations' for Historic England in London (May 2015), York (July 2015) and Manchester (February 2016).
