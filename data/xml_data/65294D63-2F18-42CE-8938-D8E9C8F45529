However, this simple categorisation does not necessarily reflect the underlying psychological characteristics of individuals who commit sexual offences. It has been hypothesised that individuals who perpetrate rape of woman have high psychopathic traits whereas many, but not all, of those who offend against children have strong paedophilic tendencies. Moreover, it has been postulated that sexual offenders with high psychopathic traits may have emotional deficits relating to fear whereas paedophilic tendencies maybe associated with social anxiety problems. However, much of the current theorizing is based on data derived from self-report measures which suffer from a lack of objectivity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to address this problem by using experimental techniques to explore the cognitive profiles of offenders who have committed different types of sexual crime. The work will focus on assessing whether&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the ability to recognise fearful facial expressions is specifically impaired in those who perpetrate sexual offences against women, as such deficits have been reported in diagnosed psychopaths&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>those with apparent paedophilic tendencies show difficulties in disengaging attention from emotionally significant stimuli as such problems are associated with anxiety.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A primary non-academic impact of our work will be in helping professionals who work with sex offenders to have a better understanding of psychological factors that cause individuals to offend sexually. This is a prerequisite for the refinement of treatment programmes and improvements in their efficacy. As such, the proposed work will be of benefit to the judicial services, offenders and victims. 

Currently, all types of male sex offenders tend to be treated alongside each other, perhaps in part reflecting an implicit assumption that there are common reasons to sexually offend. Treatment programmes typically use a CBT approach in which offenders are encouraged to think about how cognitions influence their sexual behaviours and to appreciate how their offending has injured their victims both physically and psychologically. These treatment programmes can be effective in reducing recidivism rates but sexual reoffending remains a problem. The proposed work will enable the placing of offenders into specific treatment groups on the basis of their psychological profile which will enable the CBT to better focus on the underlying reasons to offend sexually in each individual. Our close working relations with both prisons and the National Offender Management Service (Ministry of Justice) make this a realisable proposition. 

There is a widely held assumption that the rapists of women tend to show antisocial or psychopathic tendencies whereas those who abuse children may have paedophilic tendencies and often appear socially inadequate. However, less than half of those who offend sexually against children can be classed as paedophiles. Furthermore, the limited literature on the psychological attributes of sex offenders tends to be based on self-report questionnaires and these are prone to inaccuracies due to response biases. Our work will address this gap in understanding by investigating the psychological characteristics of different types of sex offender using cognitive neuropsychological tests to support data obtained from personality trait inventories. 

The project, which represents experimental research of an important applied topic, will generate findings of particular interest to forensic establishments including secure mental health facilities (e.g., Broadmoor Hospital) and secure therapeutic communities (most notably HM Prison Grendon), and the Operational Services and Interventions Group of the Ministry of Justice (UK), as well as those working with sex offenders internationally. The work has the potential to exert a direct influence upon forensic clinical practice as a result of the close working practices of the research team and the National Offender Management Service (Ministry of Justice). Presentation of the findings at meetings such as the annual ATSA conference (Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers) will ensure that the findings are disseminated to both academics and practitioners. Any resultant advances in therapy which lead to reduced recidivism rates will clearly be of benefit to potential victims and society as a whole.

 The issue of sex offending is a cause of great public concern and anxiety, especially following incidents such as the unveiling of the &amp;quot;Savile scandal.&amp;quot; Presentation of the findings of the project via press releases will lead to a more enlightened public understanding of sex offenders and their crimes. 

Capacity building
The named researcher, Steven Gillespie, already has experience with running cognitive neuropsychology tests in a prison setting and has conducted computer-based eye-tracking experiments using an Eyelink1000 system in a laboratory setting. This expertise will be extended to the conducting of eye scan path experiments with offenders using a mobile tracker in a prison setting. This will extend the competencies of Gillespie and bring the capacity to conduct such prison based studies to our research group.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>302196</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The primary aim of the project was to define neurocognitive abnormalities in convicted sex offenders with view to determining whether different types of sexual offence are related to specific neurocognitive profiles. Comparison groups included non-offenders and violent offenders. Particular attention was paid to psychopathic traits and anxiety and how these interacted with emotional facial expression recognition and the ability to disengage from emotionally significant visual stimuli.

The published findings to date show that sexual offenders, like violent offenders, show deficits with fear expressions relative to non-offending controls. These deficits generalize to other emotional expression in sexual offenders with them showing additional problems with identifying anger and disgust. The deficits in recognising fearful faces were shown to be related to psychopathic traits. Moreover, psychopathic traits were shown to be related to anxiety in both offenders and non-offenders in a more complex manner than previously thought. Thus, the egocentric traits associated with psychopathy (sometimes equated with primary psychopathy traits) were negatively associated with anxiety. By contrast, the antisocial traits associated with psychopathy (often regarded as secondary psychopathic traits) were positively associated with anxiety.

The studies have further shown how personality traits are associated with eye scan paths when looking at faces prior to judging the emotion being expressed. More specifically, the results show that psychopathic traits are related to reduced eye contact. This finding is in keeping with other published reports. However, the current work has emphasised how the effect that psychopathic traits has on the amount of eye contact made is influenced by the sex of the face and the intensity of the expression. Additional work also showed how psychopathic traits influence judgments of out-groups. The full analysis of all of the data collected has still to be completed. 

The findings from the initial analyses of the data collected are now published in four open access journal articles. It is anticipated that further analysis of the data focussing on subtypes of sex offenders which result in further publications. Elements of the work have also been presented at international conferences including the annual meeting of the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, and a Europol hosted conference. The PI has given several lectures on related topics to both sixth formers and adult general public audiences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The immediate audience for these results is a range of academic psychologists, interested in the motivational factors that drive individuals to sexually offend.
The findings will lead to a reappraisal of the way in which psychopathic traits influence the interpretation of emotional facial expressions and how this interacts with anxious and fearless personality traits. A medium term audience will include members of the prison psychology teams who implement current sex offender therapy regimes. Our work will provide guidance on how therapy programmes can be tailored to the needs of different types of sex offender. Our work may also influence the management of individuals who have committed acts of interpersonal violence.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BBE97182-37D6-47E6-A7D4-65B7E305EDD7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BB85D8E2-8F35-4F71-815B-E85D0034ECAD"><gtr:id>BB85D8E2-8F35-4F71-815B-E85D0034ECAD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Relations of Distinct Psychopathic Personality Traits with Anxiety and Fear: Findings from Offenders and Non-Offenders.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6ee1264609530e9ef61067a29a70c6de"><gtr:id>6ee1264609530e9ef61067a29a70c6de</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gillespie SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/33BF4FC5-B8FE-46F0-BB23-3FC3820B6586"><gtr:id>33BF4FC5-B8FE-46F0-BB23-3FC3820B6586</gtr:id><gtr:title>Acute alcohol consumption and secondary psychopathic traits increase ratings of the attractiveness and health of ethnic ingroup faces but not outgroup faces.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in psychiatry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/771c109bf9628fb1ad5dd2393c716832"><gtr:id>771c109bf9628fb1ad5dd2393c716832</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mitchell IJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-0640</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E7CD97F5-34BE-4F0A-A734-97562FF67E27"><gtr:id>E7CD97F5-34BE-4F0A-A734-97562FF67E27</gtr:id><gtr:title>Psychopathic traits are associated with reduced attention to the eyes of emotional faces among adult male non-offenders.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in human neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6ee1264609530e9ef61067a29a70c6de"><gtr:id>6ee1264609530e9ef61067a29a70c6de</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gillespie SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1662-5161</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/008236FE-F323-4027-A74E-407899163FC8"><gtr:id>008236FE-F323-4027-A74E-407899163FC8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Emotional expression recognition and attribution bias among sexual and violent offenders: a signal detection analysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6ee1264609530e9ef61067a29a70c6de"><gtr:id>6ee1264609530e9ef61067a29a70c6de</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gillespie SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-1078</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002337/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7DBCDE7-FDA2-465A-8338-1DA4AD7B221D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Forensic Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
