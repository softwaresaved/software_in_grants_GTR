develop processes that are both economically and environmentally sustainable, the industry will increasingly turn to

potential to revolutionize biocatalysis and IB, and additionally constrains the technical risk, as the use of biopumps allows
the optimization of only short synthetic pathways, rather than utilizing an organism's native metabolic pathways from basic

charged with producing fine and platform chemicals on the multi-kilo and -ton scale, in particular the project partner
Synthace. Additionally, many chemical companies that employ biocatalysts, such as DSM, Lonza, BASF and Dr. Reddy's,
could also benefit from the technologies developed here. Similarly, oil companies such as Shell and BP have invested
heavily in synthetic biology programmes to engineer bacteria to produce new biofuels, where new-engineered microbial
factories would be equally important. Any number of these companies could benefit through licensing agreements to use
new systems based on the technologies developed in this project.

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT: We will actively seek to communicate our findings to the wider community through scientific
meetings and scholarly publications (We consistently publish in top journals such as: JACS, PNAS, Angew. Chem. &amp;amp;
Nature Chem. Biol.). However, in order for the technology we develop to become widely adopted, particularly in industry, it
will be important to first secure any intellectual property rights for all new inventions we discover. As the research
progresses and our relationships with interested commercial partners develop, and whilst working within the conditions of
the grant, we will seek to commercially exploit these new technologies and license on IP for use in industrial-scale chemical
production processes. Improvements in cell line platform development and bioprocess efficiency, generated from this grant,
could lead to alternative sustainable sources for chemical production, and reduce the reliance upon petrochemical
feedstocks, leading to associated potential environmental benefits. This research project will also generate technology and
knowledge that will help maintain the UK's competitive edge and will produce highly trained and skilled research personnel.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>107353</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cobra Biologics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with CMO for biologics production</gtr:description><gtr:id>5013E27B-D7A5-4D1E-9969-E7D9F16AEB13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Too earlier to say, the collaboration has led to successful joint grant funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners have contributed industry R&amp;amp;D and know-how</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have contributed IP, know-how, and research expertise to this collaboration</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>iGEM Giant Jamboree</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>96244AE6-35B2-41BE-9DB9-4F6531D20AA6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Synthetic Biology iGEM Giant Jamboree</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://2016.igem.org/Giant_Jamboree</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Speaker at European Congress on Biotechnology</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB52AA12-C359-4A45-A99A-320E342987DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Q&amp;amp;A
