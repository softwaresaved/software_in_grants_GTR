After much campaigning, an Enclosure Act was granted in 1845 which allowed housing development on previously open fields to relieve the severe overcrowding and insanitary living conditions of the town. Importantly, the Act ensured that 130 acres were set aside for public open space intended to improve the health and conduct of the townspeople, particularly the working classes. During the second half of the twentieth century this originally middle-class district became a working class area with significant mixed immigrant and student communities, many multi-occupied properties and different kinds of social needs. The open spaces, however, continue to fulfil their original purpose, though the uses have changed.

The co-produced community project, The Social World of Nottingham's Historic Green Spaces, investigated the influences that led to the creation of the spaces, their changing use and misuse, the impact of war, the evolution of planting schemes, and conflict and debate about twentieth century modernisation and re-development. The project brought together community groups and stakeholders with different interests, mirroring its emphasis upon the historical co-creation, co-management and shared community usages of Nottingham's parks. The project's findings were shared through two showcase events at which 78% of the audience was non-academic, mainly from local history and heritage groups. These were followed up by articles based on the joint research, some co-written, published in local history journals. 

This follow-on project will use innovative, popular and easily accessible activities to engage and share the research with a much broader audience than was reached in the original project. The core will be a community play, written by Andy Barratt, an experienced community playwright, in collaboration with the academic and community partners of first project. The all-age cast will be recruited from the local community. It will be performed in the green spaces it discusses, mainly during 'Love Parks Week' (Aug 2016) a national Festival that celebrates parks and open spaces. Performances will be informal, allowing audiences to observe and interact as little or as much as they have the time or inclination to do. It will portray the most important and exciting moments and issues in the history of the parks, including how they have been used, developed, policed and contested from their creation to the present day. It will also challenge common assumptions about how green spaces are used now and how they might be used in the future. Videoed excerpts, together with blogs and short articles, will be uploaded to the web to geographically and demographically widen its reception. 

Around the performances will be a host of community-focused activities organised in collaboration with the project partners. All will link to the original research findings and be designed to encourage participation and knowledge sharing. Some activities will take the research into the heart of the community, using local community centres and facilities. Many will be held during 'Love Parks Week' to ensure all promotional opportunities are exploited. Some, e.g. treasure hunts or traditional games that highlight how the spaces have been used, will have broad, family appeal. Others, such as county-wide Study Day to promote the historic role of parks, will appeal to a non-academic audience from a wide geographic area. Opportunities provided by interest groups, e.g. the Friends of The Forest's annual 'Inclosure Walk' and a collaboration with Framework House Association will be used as platforms to engage and share with new groups and individuals including vulnerable adults.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is anticipated that the project will benefit the following groups in particular:

1. Nottingham City Council will benefit in two ways. First the project will engender a better understanding and appreciation of the city's parks and gardens, which in turn will lead to improved community involvement in the care and protection of such spaces. Second, it will raise the profile of these places locally, nationally and internationally and help with projecting a positive image for the City. Both these benefits are highlighted in the City Council's recently published Nottingham Heritage Strategy 2015-2030, which promotes a heritage-led approach to economic and social regeneration. The Strategy recognises the value of open space for sport, recreation, improving social behaviour, mental wellbeing, as well as being tourist attractions in their own right.

2. The mixed communities in the vicinity of the Nottingham green spaces will have an improved awareness of the historic importance of these places, the potential of these sometimes under-utilized places for health, well-being and recreation, and the role and potential benefits of parks and gardens to local communities in the 21st century. Increased awareness of the history of the origins, community usage and social conflict in relation to Nottingham parks will help empower local communities to actively participate in, and to share a sense of ownership and responsibility for these places.

3. Members of Nottingham's student communities are among the most avid users of the city's green spaces for work, sport, recreation and festivals. Although a largely transient population, students are a significant aspect of the local economy with two large universities and numerous FE and other colleges; many students choose to remain in the city beyond graduation. Numerous student halls of residence and Nottingham Trent University's main campus are close to green spaces such as the Arboretum and Forest. Moreover, Nottingham has one of the largest proportions of foreign and non-European students of any British university town, many of whom bring aspects of their own cultures (including their own traditions of using parks and gardens) and will take their experiences of Britain to their countries of origin. Students are also a very diverse group with wide subject interests and enquiring minds and a receptive audience, sometimes with passionate interests in politics and environmental issues, who would benefit significantly from greater engagement with the history and natural history of their local green spaces, and they will be strongly encouraged to take part in the performances, meetings and other activities.

4. Working with particular partner organisations, such as Framework Housing Association's 'Nature in Mind' project which works with local homeless people, people with addiction problems and other vulnerable adults, will be encouraged to contribute to the understanding and valuing of these green spaces by adults for whom local parks and gardens often represent a hospitable and safe environment, as well as a cost-free resource for health and well-being. 

5. The various community groups, associations and organisations involved will benefit from the opportunity to create and participate in new networks and finding sustainable ways of working together, both during and beyond the life of this dissemination project. 

6. Visitors to the City, both physical and virtual, will benefit from the far greater variety of historical information concerning the parks that will be made freely available via a range of websites and other media. 

7. Groups and individuals who use Nottingham's parks and gardens will gain a much deeper understanding of historic development, public usage and social conflict that will inform their engagement in current and ongoing debates concerning resources, usage and the reconciliation of different community demands and expectations within these green spaces.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73861</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This play was commissioned for the Green Spaces project.

Following on from the development of the Breathing Spaces play, each video featured a different character from a different period in history explaining to camera the importance of the parks and green spaces for them. Some of these characters appeared in the play, some not.

Each character was performed by a volunteer performer, a mixture of those who performed in the show and others.

The workshops also helped to promote the project's activities, especially Breathing Spaces.

Organised by creative writing tutor and lecturer Angela Foxwood, 30 children from a local primary school attended a workshop. The workshop began with a brief history lesson about how the appearance of Nottingham has changed over the past 300 years, with particular attention paid to the enclosure of earlier green spaces and the establishment and preservation of Nottingham's historical green spaces as a result of the 1845 Enclosure Act. 

The school children were then shown a selection of photographs and paintings of Nottingham's parks through the ages. These images were used as prompts for them to write short poems or other short pieces of imaginative writing inspired by the images and the history of the parks.

Many of the poems/writings were selected and added, along with the images and a timeline to create a large tapestry. This tapestry was then included as part of the project's public exhibition in Nottingham Local Studies Library during August 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>History and Archaeology Fair</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>245E867E-86FF-49EA-9E37-B0C16F6DF20E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The History Fair is organised by the University of Nottingham Museum.

The Arboretum is the 'jewel in the crown' of this endeavour, but the Council also ensure that trees were a focus for the other green spaces created by the 1845 Enclosure Act. This enthusiasm spilt over into 'street trees' and tree planting in private gardens. Paul's talk was followed by a brief presentation by Judith Mills on the follow-on project's public engagement activities.

Judith gave an illustrated talk entitled &amp;quot;Nottingham's Historic Green Spaces&amp;quot; which outlined the reasons for the Enclosure Act, the process by which the type and location of each was decided (e.g. why there are public walks, why there is an Arboretum) and controversial issues such as charging for entry to the Arboretum, the social problems of gambling and drunkenness, and where to locate the Church of England cemetery.

The Fair is attended by many organisations, mainly from the voluntary sector such as local history groups, friends' groups, craft groups and well as representatives from archives and library organisations and similar not-for-profit associations. Approximately 500 members of the general public attended this year, from across Nottinghamshire. 
The Social World of Nottingham's Green Spaces project had a large display next to the entrance to the Fair; consequently, everyone who came in had to pass the project's exhibits. The display comprised four striking pull-up banners and a PowerPoint presentation approximately 6 minutes long, running in a continuous loop. Dr Judith Mills and Dr Jonathan Coope from the project team 'manned' the stall during the day. They explained both the work of the original project (2013-14) and the engagement activities planned for the current project to the many visitors who stopped to look at the display and handed out information leaflets and attractive bookmarks bearing the web address. 
The audience was drawn from across the region; only a few people filled in feedback forms, but they report that distances travelled were:
1 mile or less 10 people
2 - 5 miles 8 people
6 - 10 miles 3 people
11+ miles 11 people

It ran from 3-30 August 2016. It was officially opened by Paddy Tipping, Police Commissioner for Nottinghamshire.
The exhibition comprised 
? a series of illustrated panels describing the creation and use of Nottingham's Historic Green Spaces
? two panels illustrating some of the project's engagement activities
? display cases holding related artefacts from the Local Studies Library collection
? ten short 'talking-heads' films featuring characters (e.g. park keeper, war widow, sportsman) who related aspects of the history of the green spaces.
In parallel there were talks by project members (Paul Elliott and Jonathan Coope), a children's games workshop, and a workshop specifically for services users of Framework's Nature in Mind programme. The project team also gave presentations to the Nottinghamshire Local History Associations 'Angel Row Forum' event which was held in the exhibition space.
Interest in the exhibition resulted in a 20 minute interview on Radio Nottingham, a double-page spread in the Nottingham Post and several requests for talks to local history or community groups.

Each workshop began with an introduction to the words 'Arboretum' and 'Aviary'. This was followed by an explanation (suited to the age group) of why Nottingham had an Arboretum. The class then talked about the range of trees and the type of birds kept in the Arboretum which involved a discussion about continents. 
Afterwards the children cut out and decorated some cardboard birds. Some children took their work home, but others donated it to the project and it was hung in one of the Aviaries while Breathing Spaces was being performed.
The aim was to introduce young children in the area to some of the history associated with their local parks, and also raise awareness amongst teachers of these potential educational resources. The workshops also helped to promote the project's activities, especially the specially commissioned play, Breathing Spaces.
Overall, the workshops touched on several National Curriculum areas.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ng-spaces.org.uk/making-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NCCPE Engage Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>83082E99-096A-495A-AA46-F20CA98E3159</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The NCCPE Annual Conference brings together representatives from Universities and other institutions and some community-based groups to learn about public engagement initiatives from the UK through plenary sessions, workshops, exhibitions and discussions.
