The research documents that, in the garment and construction sector in India and China, firms offer terms and conditions below the national minimum levels stipulated by national legislation, and below what the International Labour Organisation (ILO) considers 'decent work'. This is done by international and national firms alike, and by government owned companies as well as by private sector companies. They employ labourers through chains of subcontracting and through the use of labour contractors. The project has used its evidence to highlight areas of improvements necessary to achieve decent work. The focus has been on improvements of terms and conditions for workers, and improved regulation of labour contractors. 

In India and China the project has had direct impact on high level policy debates. In China, CI Pun Ngai provided project based background information for a 'Proposal Regarding the Labour Protection for the Construction Workers' that was submitted to the 2015 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference by Professor Wang Hui (member, CPPCC). The proposal was debated by the CPPCC and has received formal replies by the Government of China Construction Ministry and Labour Bureau concerning the subcontracting system in the construction industry, labour contracts and wage payments. For the 2016 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, CI Pun Ngai has provided project based background information for a proposal on 'Further Implementation of Labour Protection for the Silicosis Victims in Construction Sector', submitted by Mr. Chang Ka Mun (Hong Hong based member of CPPCC) . These initiatives are on-going and CI Pun NGia continues the evidence based dialogue with CPPCC members. The receptiveness of the Government to the CPPCC proposals must be noted as an encouraging sign that real change in possible in these areas. (Note that the CPPCC initiatives are listed as 'engagement activities' not as 'influence on policy' as the latter category does not allow for influence of the kind achieved here).

In India, CI Ravi Srivastava has presented the project evidence on construction workers employed through labour contractors in Government Advisory Committees (of which he is a member) and taken part in briefings and high level discussion meetings with government officials. A key focus of this has been to evidence how existing legislation for Indian inter-state migrants (the Interstate Migrant Workers' Act) falls short of protecting circular migrant workers in the construction industry. He has also provided similar formal evidence to NGOs and Unions in support of their work to propose amendments to the existing legislation. These initiatives are on-going.

Globally, the project has aimed at providing information to a wide audience of development professionals on labour conditions and labour contracting systems across different types of firms. It circulated its four 2-page 'Development Viewpoints' with the main findings of the project to 10,000 contacts. In 2014 PI Lerche and CIs Pun Ngai and Alessandra Mezzadri presented its main findings to ILO officials at the ILO headquarter in Geneva, and PI Ravi Srivastava was invited to publish an ILO working paper drawing on the findings from the Indian construction sector (2016). In 2014, PI Lerche presented at the UNDP headquarter in New York, to officials preparing the 2015 Human Development Report on 'Work'. 

Achieving impact in relation to international organisations in the area of labour relations and conditions takes time. In the short run or next activity is a popular piece on garment labour relations in China, requested by the ILO. The next concerted international push of the project is being planned in relation to the two major reports now published by the project on garment and construction labour relations in India.

The last strands of the impact work of the project is working with International Non-Government Organisations, and seeking wider publicity for the findings of the project. On construction, PI Lerche was invited by the European network of construction researchers and trade union officers contribute a paper on conditions in the construction industry in China and India to its CLR Magazine (2014). Regarding the garment sector, CI Mezzadri was interviewed and quoted by the Huffington Post on labour conditions in the Indian garment industry and the role of corporate social responsibility in improving these. She also regularly appears on UK NGO organised panels regarding consumers and garment commodity chains (two panels in the last four months). Both PI Lerche and CI Mezzadri blog in project based issues regarding labour contractors in construction and garment in India and the related absence of Decent Work. The publication of Mezzadri's monograph on the Indian garment sector in April 2016 (Cambridge Univeristy Press) and CI Pun Ngai's monograph on Migrant workers in China will intensify the publicity work further. A number of meetings in the US are planned (CI Pun Ngai) and are being arranged in the UK (CI Alessandra Mezzadri).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6A29B676-7841-4E5F-8863-3CA4CFEC00B2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research investigated labour conditions in the two most important sectors for rural circular migrant labour, construction and garments, in the two largest conurbations of the two biggest Asian countries: Greater New Delhi and Greater Shanghai. 

Finding 1: In both cities labour is affected by a triple absence.
Wages and some working conditions are better in Shanghai than in Delhi where most wages are below the legal minimum. However, in both countries labour suffer from a triple absence: the absence of formally recognised labour relations and formally recognised employers, the absence of the de jure or de facto rights to organise, and the absence of wider citizen rights. This is core to the lack of decent work and decent lives for the labourers. Our research establishes this triple absence for the first time. The triple absence is particularly pronounced for the organised, large-scale construction sector in both countries which solely employs unregistered circular migrants hired through labour contractors (highly skilled workers are an exception and may be registered). In the garment sector, especially in Shanghai, direct employment of workers by the factories is more common but the second and third absences are prevalent across the board. In both countries, government and local government practices lead to the absence of local citizen rights for circular migrants (no urban hukuo in Shanghai, no local registration for social and educational rights in Delhi), and to the absence of the protection of labour rights for migrant workers. 

Finding 2: Small garment workshops are common in Shanghai. This goes against the established view that garment production in China - which constitutes more than one-third of the world's garment export - is overwhelmingly factory based. 
The structure of the garment sector in India, involving subcontracting from larger to smaller factories, workshops and home workers, is also present in Shanghai. This structure is enabled by the sector's seasonality and its ability to parcel up production into discrete elements. The workshop workforce and its conditions in Shanghai are different from the factories and vary significantly internally. Some workshop workers are highly skilled and well paid, others are poorly paid, still others are egalitarian. Working conditions are worse than in the factories. The workshop findings question all existing generalisations about pay and conditions of garment workers in China and have policy implications.

Finding 3: There is no significant difference between wages in export oriented and domestic market oriented factories or between large scale and small factories. 
Wages in the construction sector are alike between worksites in each of the two cities, as nearly all workers' wages are set by labour contractors. In garment production in Delhi, wages are similar across factory types and between factories and workshops and only homeworkers are paid significantly less. Large export units offer better conditions and more continuous work than others but not better pay. Western consumer movements and CSR have not provided better pay and there is a need for national policy solutions instead.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The objective is to influence international recommendations and national legislation on 'Decent Work'. Findings 1 and 3 are of most relevance here.

The profile of the project within academia is growing. Publishing with continue for 2 years. Two more reports and four academic articles and one synthesis book will be published. Keynote speeches, conference and workshop presentations and invitations to comment on new research continue. CI Mezzadri is a founding member of the new research network 'responsible global value chains'. New research projects involving PI Lerche and CI Pun Ngai and planned research by CI Mezzadri will take findings further. The standing of CIs Pun Ngai and Ravi Srivastava within academia in China and India enable maximum academic impact there.

Outside academia routes to impact are through Labour Unions and NGOs, and direct engagement with Governments and international organisations. Four briefing papers was circulated to 10,000 professionals and practitioners and presented at UNDP and ILO headquarters. PIs Pun Ngai and Srivastava continue their successful work with unions, NGOs and governments in India and China. PI Lerche continues initiatives with the ILO while Mezzadri and Lerche work with UK and European based NGOs in the construction and garment global sectors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E0D723CE-B2DD-4929-8B0F-95E796F8E427</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.soas.ac.uk/development/research/labour/labour-conditions-and-the-working-poor-in-china-and-india/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CI Srivastava: Working Group on Reforms in the Interstate Migrant Workers' Act, Government of India Ministry of Labour</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>46757D3E-693F-42D2-9576-64DE164C1C98</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CI Srivastava: Government of India Committee on Housing Needs of Migrants.
