Amongst the starkest examples are aspects of human capital formation and investment in infrastructure.
A long tail of poor achievement at the end of secondary education has been a defining feature of the UK school systems. A fifth of children in England on free school meals do not reach the expected maths level at age 7 and this proportion rises to a third by age 11.This sets the UK apart from several other advanced economies, and creates damaging effects for both growth and inequality.
Vocational education and apprenticeships have been the object of continuing political attention and policy reform for decades. Despite these efforts, a longstanding feature of the UK skills system is its relative weakness in intermediate level training in comparison with some of its main competitors.
Investment in infrastructure, especially transport and energy, is another area where enduring weaknesses have been identified. High levels of congestion are placing parts of the transport system under strain. Deteriorating energy generating capacity is raising fears that security of supply may not be ensured in the medium term.
Since the 1990s, house building and development in certain areas of the UK has become a significant problem, with growth and redistributive implications. Evidence suggests it has led to increases in house prices and reductions in housing quality, increases in housing market volatility, and large transfers of wealth from the young and the poor to the old and the wealthy. 
In all of these areas, existing studies have concentrated on identifying and measuring the effects of policy inefficiencies, and proposing alternative policy arrangements. In other countries, research has started to shift from studying the relative merits of different policy alternatives, to studying the obstacles to the introduction of different sets of policies. In the UK, however, this type of research is still rare, and fundamental questions regarding the origins of inefficiencies remain unanswered. 
There has been little detailed analysis of the structures of incentives that lie at the foundations of long-lasting policy distortions in those areas. I.e. a systematic treatment of the political economy roots of these distortions is still largely missing. The same can be said of studies of the drivers of institutional reform, focused on the conditions under which welfare-improving institutional change becomes feasible. 
This project aims to fill these gaps, building on existing literature and giving policy makers and civil society a wider set of analytical tools with which to frame debates around institutional reform of growth-relevant policy areas. 
The project aims to achieve this by producing a detailed account of the political economy root-causes of structural weaknesses that hamper growth. This will involve an interdisciplinary research effort, bridging political economy and political science, to embed the analysis firmly in the idiosyncrasies of the UK macro-political system. This exercise will shed light on the institutional changes required to address those weaknesses and promote long-term growth. The final step is to investigate the constellation of forces that drive institutional change in politically-charged environments, such as those that surround skills formation and infrastructure investment.
The analysis will draw on available evidence on entrenched policy dysfunctions in skills and infrastructure; political economy models, while seeking to explore their interactions with the Westminster parliamentary model; results from international empirical research looking at the conditions required to initiate reforms, their effective development and implementation; and new research on recent policy innovation in the UK, including changes in the governance of monetary, fiscal and competition policy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims to shed light on the causes of structural weaknesses in UK skills and infrastructure investment that hinder economic growth in the medium to long-run. As a result, the range of individuals and organisations likely to be interested in and benefit from the results is relatively wide.

Most directly, it is likely to be of relevance for policy makers (including politicians and civil servants) as well as researchers and policy specialists in third sector organisations and NGOs with a focus on institutional reform to foster growth-friendly policy environments. The goal is to offer these groups a sound conceptual framework with which to analyse the origins of persistent weaknesses in skills and infrastructure, as well as to draw up potential solutions and pathways to reform. 

In the medium to long-run, and to the extent the findings contribute to moving the debate on institutional reform forward, the group of potential indirect beneficiaries is large and dispersed. It could extend to users of the transport and energy networks, including end consumers as well as firms whose activities rely heavily on the quality and efficiency of these networks; investors in infrastructure whose projects/plans are currently damaged by policy uncertainty and political procrastination; businesses that struggle to find a pool of high quality intermediate/vocational skills from which to recruit; large sections of the population (especially young generations) currently priced out of the housing market or subject to relatively poor and expensive housing services; and large numbers of children, especially from deprived socio-economic backgrounds, who currently finish compulsory education without the numeracy and literacy skills required to participate effectively in the labour market.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>108783</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The UK suffers from a series of persistent policy problems to which existing institutions and processes seem unable to produce adequate long-term solutions. Investments in human capital, infrastructure, and housing are prime examples of areas where problems have long been identified, and where there have been little signs of improvements. We set out to develop an analytical framework to shed light on the institutional roots of persistent policy problems in the UK, including options for reform and how it might come about, and to apply this framework to two of the important policy areas we have highlighted above: infrastructure investment and housing policy.

Referring to our report on the political economy of infrastructure, Out-law.com (Pinsent and Masons) said:
'This report effectively adds weight to the Armitt Review's proposal for a National Infrastructure Commission; helping to build momentum towards that in advance of Sir John Armitt's response to a consultation on his proposals, due in early February, and then in the run-up to the general election,&amp;quot; said Robbie Owen, a planning and government affairs expert at Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law.com.'

In the Public Bill Committee, Infrastructure Bill [Lords], on Thursday 8 January 2015, Andrew Miller (Ellesmere Port and Neston) (Lab) said:
 'On a point of order, Mr Hood. I reciprocate your good wishes for the new year. Last week, we discussed the infrastructure commission, and that day the Institute for Government published an important document called &amp;quot;The Political Economy of Infrastructure in the UK&amp;quot;. May I take this opportunity, through your good offices, Mr Hood, to bring that to the Minister's attention so that he has an opportunity to read the document before he formally responds to the debate? I have brought with me some copies for the convenience of the Committee.'

With respect to the same report, Richard Burden, MP, said in the House of Commons, on 26 January 2015:
'During the Committee stage, the Institute of Government published a booklet called &amp;quot;The Political Economy of Infrastructure in the UK&amp;quot;, which concluded that we need to change the &amp;quot;institutional architecture&amp;quot; for infrastructure decision making. Labour Members completely agree. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham called for this House to back the proposal by Sir John Armitt, chair of the Olympic Delivery Authority, for a national infrastructure commission that would look three decades ahead and consult across all sectors to provide an evidence-based assessment of infrastructure priorities in the UK. Parliament would be able to vote on these, and Governments would be held accountable for delivering them.'

In October 2015, the Government announced the creation of a 'National Infrastructure Commission', to provide expert, independent advice on pressing infrastructure issues. The commission is charged with setting out a clear picture of the future infrastructure we need, producing an in-depth assessment of the UK's major infrastructure needs on a 30-year time horizon. The commission supposed to build on the work of individual actors, including government departments, sub-national and regional bodies and regulators, using a robust, common methodology to develop needs assessments that take account of strategic cross-sector considerations.

In July 2015, the Government announced a series of initiatives designed to streamline and speed up local planning processes; intervene in those local authorities that fail to produce a timely plan to accommodate future housing need; strengthen co-operation between local authorities; use development corporations to deliver higher-density development in commuter transport hubs; give new planning powers to mayors and combined authorities; and create a 'zonal system' for statutory registers of brownfield land, which will be granted automatic planning permission.

In particular: 

? Revealed that structural weaknesses in the UK economy, e.g. infrastructure investments and housing, are deeply rooted in the institutions, processes and incentives that underpin the formulation of policy.

? Presented evidence that the British political system, in some areas of policy, including infrastructure and housing, and compared to other countries, amplifies the risk of sub-optimal outcomes. Specifically, it amplifies the biases caused by marginal voters/constituencies; poses exceptional challenges to the formulation of credible policy commitments over the long term; and its intensely partisan and adversarial political environment clouds debates about policy options.
 
? Identified multiple problems in policy making around infrastructure investments in the UK: short-sightedness and lack of forward-looking strategy; failure to secure cross-party agreement, translated into high political risk; weaknesses in the evidence base, even in the cases where there is cross- party support; and failure to secure local community consent, which often leads to political procrastination.

? Developed options for institutional reform designed to address those problems, based on a review of international best practice: namely the creation of a deliberative forum where politicians, experts, interest groups, and representatives of local communities may engage in structured, informed discussions about policy options for infrastructure investment. 

? The results of the research on infrastructure were cited in Parliament (House of Commons Public Bill Committee); fed into the consultation process of the &amp;quot;Independent Armitt Review of Infrastructure&amp;quot;; and were widely commented on by professional groups (e.g. Civil Engineering Contractors Association, Construction Industry Training Board, Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation, Pinsent Masons) and specialist press (e.g. Public Finance).

? Identified the institutional roots of housing supply constraints that afflict some parts of England: a combination of weak or absent city-wide/regional planning coordination; high fiscal centralisation / limited local fiscal autonomy; planning system based on &amp;quot;development control&amp;quot; (individual planning permissions) rather than on general rules. 

? Presented evidence that the risk of housing planning decisions in England being distorted in favour of current homeowners is real and significant.

? Described the type of changes in the governance of land that would be required to address the problem: an approach to planning that is based on, but it is not confined to, the input from local communities, i.e. a rebalancing of planning powers from the local higher tiers of governance.
? The results of our work on housing captured the interest of the media (e.g. The Economist, Public Finance, Local Government Chronicle, Public Sector Executive), and received praise from a panel of academics, policy experts, and professional groups in private roundtable held at the Institute for Government on the 17th of November 2014. We are in the process of submitting a paper summarising this work to an academic journal. 

? Identified examples of institutional reform that show the way forward for the UK to address the structural weaknesses mentioned above. These include cases where party-political battles led to successful institutional reform, and where governments whose plans had run against public opposition came to adopt innovative policy making practices.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>On the academic side, there are two main areas of our work where further research is warranted. First, the empirical analysis of the political economy of housing supply restrictions could be taken forward as new data is made available and allows the use of econometric techniques geared towards inferring causality. Housing economists are those best placed to take up that challenge. Second, we concluded that the existing literature on the drivers of institutional reform is still embryonic and offered examples of gaps in the theory. Making progress in this area requires a cross-disciplinary effort from political economists and political scientists devoted to studying institutional change. 

On the policy side, our findings provide clear guidance regarding the type of institutional reforms required to address problems in the governance of housing and infrastructure in the UK. Our work also suggests that institutional reform usually comes from crises, incremental change that accumulates into fundamental institutional transformations; shifts in beliefs/ideas about how policies/institutions connect to outcomes; and the electoral, party-political battle. The impact of our research, therefore, rests on influencing beliefs/ideas about institutions and their effects.

For that purpose, we have been engaging, and will continue to engage, with policy makers and other relevant stakeholders. They have been instrumental to the development of the research and are, at the same time, key targets for the dissemination of our findings. Examples include political actors in Whitehall (e.g. politicians and senior officials in government departments with policy briefs relevant to the project, such as HMT, BIS, and DfT); as well as the wider community of think tanks, NGOs, third sector organisations, and businesses with an interests in the political economy of growth. Apart from ongoing direct engagement with these groups, we have plans to launch, after the general election, a non-technical summary of our findings in an event that will bring again the results of our research to their attention.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>81DDC955-F026-4044-A745-A95907230BF6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/our-work/better-policy-making/political-economy-growth-and-institutional-reform-uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4499B281-4E53-438B-9B47-4E83D114C596"><gtr:id>4499B281-4E53-438B-9B47-4E83D114C596</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Political Economy of Infrastructure in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/114c9964bc414904fa39853b3cb5e07a"><gtr:id>114c9964bc414904fa39853b3cb5e07a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coelho, M.C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D2CA6B6E-9284-4511-8DE8-74F2203CD883"><gtr:id>D2CA6B6E-9284-4511-8DE8-74F2203CD883</gtr:id><gtr:title>Political Economy of Policy Failure and Institutional Reform</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/114c9964bc414904fa39853b3cb5e07a"><gtr:id>114c9964bc414904fa39853b3cb5e07a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coelho, M.C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C4DB2957-9E56-473C-8F24-436D5C40BF91"><gtr:id>C4DB2957-9E56-473C-8F24-436D5C40BF91</gtr:id><gtr:title>Power, Transport, Aviation and Water: The political economy of infrastructure in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/76ac257381ec2f8588968566ec0529b1"><gtr:id>76ac257381ec2f8588968566ec0529b1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coelho, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A58B2730-8E95-4106-A508-3A45841D7D66"><gtr:id>A58B2730-8E95-4106-A508-3A45841D7D66</gtr:id><gtr:title>The political economy of housing in England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New Political Economy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f2fea23f0e76fccade1c10623c091270"><gtr:id>f2fea23f0e76fccade1c10623c091270</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coelho M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A20962C6-1431-460C-A2D3-DBBF20BE13C0"><gtr:id>A20962C6-1431-460C-A2D3-DBBF20BE13C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Political Economy of Major Infrastructure in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/76ac257381ec2f8588968566ec0529b1"><gtr:id>76ac257381ec2f8588968566ec0529b1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coelho, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DEFE5558-303F-40B2-8D1A-7C8EBF48A857"><gtr:id>DEFE5558-303F-40B2-8D1A-7C8EBF48A857</gtr:id><gtr:title>Housing That Works for All: The Political Economy of Housing in England</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/114c9964bc414904fa39853b3cb5e07a"><gtr:id>114c9964bc414904fa39853b3cb5e07a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coelho, M.C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L008289/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>249FA81B-498A-424B-9C57-C9BC20E4F688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Macroeconomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
