(QUIPSII)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N015649/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Under the ESRC-DFID funded 'ART' project (Assessing Rural Transformations) a robust methodology and protocol for qualitative impact evaluation (known as the 'QUIP') was designed and piloted for use primarily by NGOs promoting household level food security and poverty reduction through rural livelihood interventiions. This should help to strengthen learning and accountability feedback loops for their development interventions. 

The QUIP incorporates many best practice characteristics of other qualitative impact evaluation methods, including contribution analysis and process tracing. It also emphasises complementarity with quantitative performance monitoring. In addition, it broke new ground in addressing problems of pro-project or confirmation bias, and in promoting transparency (hence auditability) in the analysis of text data. This follow-on proposal is to help us broaden and deepen adoption of these innovations, following positive feedback on the QUIP from both practitioners and evaluation specialists. 

While believing that the QUIP has potential to be adapted for use by a wide range of organisations, the proposal is to promote its adoption particularly among impact investors in the field of socially responsible financial inclusion and enterprise development. Impact investment is a rapidly growing field, and its performance also hinges on being able to make credible and cost-effective assessment of impact at the household level in complex contexts that are often subject to rapid change. Financial inclusion and enterprise development are leading areas of impact investment. They are subject to ongoing debate about the potential for market-led development strategies for which better evidence of household level impact is needed. This is also a field in which the Principal Investigator has substantial expertise and an established international reputation. 

The following steps are required to promote the QUIP in this field: 
(1) Close engagement with existing networks and leading organisations promoting financial inclusion and enterprise development (e.g. CGAP, ACTION International, DCED, GIIN, SEEP, SoCAP, UNCDF), including analysis of current impact evaluation approaches and relevant publications. (2) Adaptation of the QUIP to meet the needs of organisations working in this sector, including further development of the open access QUIP analysis software. 
(3) Preparation and web dissemination of QUIP materials specifically tailored to potential users in this sector - e.g. to accommodate different impact domains. 
(4) Development and testing of tools for training and supporting those interested in (a) commissioning QUIP studies, (b) being employed as researchers to carry them out. 
(5) Translation and testing of key materials into Spanish, French and Hindi. Further web based dissemination activities in these languages.
(6) Identification of - and collaboration with - organisations willing to commit to QUIP studies at their own expense.
 
To spearhead promotion of the QUIP we are also exploring setting up a specialist consultancy organisation dedicated to this task as a research spin-off company. We believe that doing so will enable us to scale-up dissemination and use of the QUIP more rapidly, effectively and sustainably. Separate funds have already been obtained in the form of an 'ICURe' grant to support this business development aspect of promotion of the QUIP from the SETsquared Partnership. Backed by Innovate UK and HEFCE, this is the leading enterprise collaboration between the universities of Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Southampton and Surrey. The purpose of the ICURe grant is restricted to helping a named early career researchera through a narrowly specified set of market validation and business planning activities. These are complementary to the impact and engagement activities requested in this proposal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit and how?

The immediate beneficiaries of the project will be public and private social impact investors who face the problem of how to address the attribution challenge in assessing the social impact of their work. Improved feedback on the contribution of activities to positive and negative social impact can support (a) short feedback loops via internal learning and operational adjustments (b) long feedback through improved wider accountability and resource allocation. The QUIP will be useful to any social impact investor serious about the need for strong social impact reality checks in evaluating their efforts to reduce problems of economic insecurity, poverty, injustice and social exclusion through improved access to financial services, employment and self-employment. 

Benefits will be achieved directly by seeking out organisations willing to take up and use the QUIP. We will do this by building up and supporting networks of (a) skilled commissioners willing and able to finance QUIP studies themselves, and (b) professional researchers skilled in carrying out such studies. Our longer term goal is to set up an independent non-profit company to drive this work forward on a sustainable footing. Initial interest in the QUIP has come from organisations ranging from Diageo to IIED and the Stromm Foundation in Norway.

Second, benefits will be achieved indirectly by broadening the range and accessibility of material available about the QUIP (and hence the ideas underpinning it) in order to influence social impact evaluation methods and practices. We will do this by engaging in practitioner and academic debates over how to add to the evidence base for socially responsible impact investment in ways that are methodologically robust.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74379</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>F1F9 India Private Limited</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>F1F9</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7569BAD-C315-4CC8-B0E7-655C38C0D30D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main output is the QUIP spreadsheet, still undergoing further development so it is not publicly available yet.

This was completed in 2016, and a publication based on the findings (commissioned independently by Diageo) is due for publication in the first half of 2017. Diageo saw the QuiP as a pilot &amp;quot;deep dive&amp;quot; to explore possible positive and negative effects of their smallholder barley procurement in Ethiopia at the household level and below. We found evidence of positive impact on household incomes and education. We also found some rising inequality, due to rising land rents and more seriously negative shocks to some farmers arising from credit being advanced against poor seed. This has prompted follow-up discussion about risk sharing mechanisms that Diageo might develop with their partners.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aga Khan Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:description>Aga Khan Development Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>440F5B35-F222-4380-9481-0F1FD0A2E2CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Webcase of a public lecture: Cautionary tales of complex causation: Qualitative and mixed method impact assessment of climate change and livelihood transformations in Africa.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>AGDN financed a public lecture on the QuIP by James Copestake in Ottawa.

The ART project designed and tested a new Qualitative Impact Assessment Protocol (QuIP) for NGO interventions in climate change and rural livelihood development projects. This project explore how far the QuIP tool could be adapted for use by public and private sector Social Impact Investors - hence the name QuIPSII.

The project achieved its main goal of consulting with a broad range of social impact investors on (a) their current thinking and practice in relation to the need to assess the social impact of their investments (b) their response to the QuIP as one way of addressing this need. It also contributed to building interest in making use of the QuIP. In response we set up a non-profit start-up company called Bath Social and Development Research (BSDR Ltd) as a vehicle for underting commissined QuIP studies and associated consultancy with impact investors and microfinance organisations. See BSDR under Collaborations for more information on these. 

Two key findings were that
(a) current thinking and practice remains very fragmented, with respect to terminology as well as methodology; 
(b) there is potential demand for use of the QuIP alongside other social performance assessment mechanisms, but responding to this need is quite resource intensive, as potential users give a high priority to tailoring methods to their own priorities and practices. 

These and other findings are set out in more detail in the CDS Briefing paper - social impact investment and the attribution challenge. See the link below.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A new website has been set up (http://bsdr.org) containing guidelines for the QuIP have been updated in the light of feedback, and they have been translated into French and Spanish.

However, as both an exploratory and confirmatory evaluation method it does incorporate some innovative features that are relevant to purer or academic social science research methods (e.g. in relation to methods to reduce confirmation bias and improve data coding). In addition to pursuing opportunities for commercialising the QuIP in development practice and among impact investors, we have also presented it to more academic audiences, and are planning applications to more academic work (e.g. through Maconachie's new project for Humanity United) on assessing wellbeing along informal mining value chains in West Africa).</gtr:description><gtr:id>A4D7621A-FF36-4416-9805-39CC5317B29E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The QuIP has attracted a lot of interest among other researchers, and been presented at several conferences (including in Bordeaux, London, Manchester, Pretoria, Stockholm) and through invited seminars (including for DFID, Save the Children, Oxfam UK, OPM Ltd, the National Audit Office and the Aga Khan Development Network).
