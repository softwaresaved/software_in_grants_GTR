Change</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L001829/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>When social workers work with children who have been or are likely to be abused or neglected, their first duty is to try to ensure the safety of the child. In many situations, such children can remain with their parents or main carers, so long as the necessary support can be provided to prevent further abuse or neglect from occurring. Where this is not possible, the removal of children into the care system is often the only remaining option. Crucial to maintaining a child successfully at home is the engagement of the parents with the necessary services, and the ability of those parents to make changes in their parenting behaviour. Unfortunately, the difficulties of assessing and understanding parents' engagement and capacities to change are significant. Instances are relatively common of social workers being over-optimistic about parents' abilities, or of misinterpreting willingness or friendliness towards professionals for a genuine ability to change their behaviour. Shortcomings of this kind have occurred in significant numbers of cases involving child deaths from abuse or neglect, the well-know case in the UK of 'Baby Peter' being a notable example.

The principal investigator of the proposed project (Dr Platt) has extensive experience in both practice and research in relation to engaging parents with services, and working to change and enhance their parenting behaviour. Most recently, he has published a model that seeks to explain what leads to good engagement of parents with the necessary service interventions. This model will be used as the cornerstone for the project, which will involve developing methods and materials to help social workers assess, more accurately, parental engagement and capacity to change. The project will also draw on other relevant work, both at the University of Bristol, and (internationally) in social work and related disciplines.

At the centre of this project will be a consultation with partner organisations to develop methods and materials that will be usable in the pressurised context of social work practice. Three organisations have agreed to work with the University of Bristol, all of which are local authority children's services departments in the South West of England. They have agreed to commit staff time to the collaborative development of these materials, working with a small team from the university, comprising the principal investigator, and a research associate who will be a social worker with relevant practice experience. Following an initial design phase, groups of staff in each partner agency will be given training in using the new methods, followed by a period during which consultancy will be provided to support the use of those materials in practice.

Towards the end of the project, which has a proposed duration of 12 months, there will be an evaluation of the usefulness, applicability and success of the methods and materials that will have been developed. Following evaluation, the materials will be revised as necessary, and disseminated more widely. Dissemination will be through publication in suitably accessible formats, by offering training on a fee-paid basis to organisations who may request it, and through the usual academic outlets. Further evaluation of the impact of use of the materials on outcomes for children over a longer time frame would be beyond the scope of the project, but, depending on findings, a future funding bid from a suitable funder would be considered.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As shown in the Case for Support, problems have been identified in the way social work practitioners understand parents' engagement with services and their capacity to change their behaviour, in families where there are significant concerns about the welfare of the children. The present proposal is intended to help address these difficulties by developing practice methods and materials for assessing these features, and in doing so to contribute to the following outcomes:
i) Application of the assessment methods will lead to improved decision-making regarding interventions for children subject to child welfare concerns.
ii) Application of the assessment methods will lead to improved understanding of parental engagement and capacity to change by participating social workers, and improved skills in assessing these.
iii) The methods of assessment of parental engagement and capacity to change will be usable and valued in the social work practice context.

Strategies for achieving these impacts have been included as a fundamental part of the design of this project, in the sense that the work will involve collaboration with practitioners to bring an existing body of (international and interdisciplinary) research and theory into the practice arena in a manner that is relevant and accessible. Within the lifetime of the project, it is intended that the achievement of the above outcomes will be demonstrated through the work of social work practitioners in partner organisations who participate in the project.

Beyond the lifetime of the project, the materials designed as part of the project will be revised on the basis of the year's experience, and will be disseminated widely to practitioners across the UK. The PI has links with a relevant training agency, and with the organisation Research in Practice (a subscription-based organisation working with a network of local authorities and social work organisations), and these and other relevant options will be examined with a few to making the materials available to local authorities and other relevant organisations.

With regard to impact within the research community, in addition to the above activities the following will be undertaken:
i) At the end of the project, the intention is that the revised practice materials will be ready for regular use by the partner authorities, and would be usable by other social work organisations. Application in this way would enable us to seek funding from an appropriate funding body for research activities exploring a) the potential to widen the applicability of the materials, for example in the context of greater ethnic diversity; and b) to evaluate the impact not only on practitioners, but also on outcomes for children and families over a longer time period.
ii) In addition to the funder's normal reporting requirements, the results of the project would be written up for publication in academic journals. A minimum of two such papers are anticipated, and the target date for submission will be 30th April and 30th Sept 2015.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76041</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Interface Enterprises</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Training partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>C52CCD13-6FAA-4B73-B2CB-0BD109D64A96</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our collaboration with Interface is multi-disciplinary in that their staff have backgrounds in clinical psychology as well as social work.

As part of the project, the approach was used in practice by social workers within the three partner local authorities that were involved. The impact on social work practice in these authorities is described in the key findings report. Drawing on these findings, the intention is that the approach will benefit vulnerable children by improving decision-making both in terms of accuracy and timeliness. Both of these improvements are known to support the development and well being of children affected. Beyond the original Knowledge Exchange Opportunities Scheme project itself, there has been considerable interest from social workers and children's social care providers across the UK and beyond. We have made the C-Change assessment manual available on-line as a free download. It was first posted in early April 2016, and to date (14.9.16) we have recorded 1370 downloads. Various local authorities have seen the value and potential of the C-Change approach, and discussions are under way with a view to providing them with staff training. The local authorities that are interested are drawn from across the UK, from regions as far apart as North-east Scotland and South-east England. We have also had discussion by email with a local authority in Australia, where colleagues are using the C-Change manual as a basis for some in-house training. To enable us to respond to requests for training in the UK, we have established a partnership with an independent sector training provider (see Collaborations and Partnerships) who will be licensed to use the C-Change materials. We are also working to submit a funding bid to support further evaluation and development of the approach, and further details, if successful, will be provided in a future update.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3F577999-271C-451D-9FBC-EE5F35494F15</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>In a professional context where suitable practice methodologies are underdeveloped, C-Change builds on earlier developments and offers new approaches and new principles for social workers to assess parents' capacities to change their behaviours in circumstances where their children are at risk of maltreatment or other welfare challenges.</gtr:description><gtr:id>48ED768C-3BCE-4FC1-8761-80EC00B97B2B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Observable impacts were documented in the evaluation for this project, i.e. the piloting of the C-Change approach.

The principle achievement of this project was the development of an assessment framework for use by social workers for assessing parental capacity to change, in circumstances where there are risks of maltreatment or other forms of harm. The framework has been named C-Change.

2. The C-Change approach has two key components: 
 Understanding - assessing barriers and facilitators that are affecting the parents' attempts to change their behaviour; and
 Action - time-limited assessment of the parents' efforts to make changes (with appropriate support and intervention).

3. The first of these two components is a new development, involving the introduction to social work practice of relevant material from behaviour change theory and research. This theoretical material is presented in the form of a framework for assessing barriers to and facilitators of parental change. The second component is drawn from the work of Harnett (2007) in Australia, and uses techniques such as Goal Attainment Scaling to measure parents' progress.

3. The C-Change approach was piloted with 129 practitioners and managers in the three local authorities who participated in the project. These participants attended training events, received copies of a pilot practice handbook, and were asked to apply the approach in their own practice. C-Change was widely used following the training. Fifty percent of participants in the two-day training events responded to a survey at the 3-4 month follow-up point (n=53). Of these, 85% reported that they had been able to use the approach in practice. Prior to the introduction of the C-Change approach, social workers' responses suggested that they had access to a very limited range of evidence-based methods of assessing parental capacity to change.

4. There were demonstrable benefits reported by participants who completed survey returns at the 3-4 month follow-up point. They included: 

 i) Significantly improved knowledge and skills in assessing capacity to change. Data were collected using self-efficacy style questionnaires, and improvements were detected immediately following the training (t (46) = 9.833, p .001, r= .82) and after 3/4 months (t (46) = 3.907, p .001, r= .49). The improvements were evident across all sub-scales, i.e. in relation to assessing barriers and facilitators of change, assessing actual changes in parenting behaviour, and understanding the connection between the C-Change assessment and other relevant processes and procedures.

 ii) Significant improvements in participants' self-assessed abilities to achieve decisions within the child's timeframe (McNemar-Bowker test: ?2 (2)= 7.451, p .05, n=48), compared with their responses before the training.

 iii) Reported improvements in the quality of assessments, based on participants' opinions at 3-4 month follow-up. 92% of respondents (from the 2-day training events, n=52) indicated that the C-Change approach had improved the quality of assessments, and 44% rated this level of improvement as 'good' or 'considerable'.

Qualitative responses from participants suggested that there was further work to be done in embedding the C-Change approach within the work of their organisations.

The C-Change assessment manual has been revised and will be published on a dedicated site within the University of Bristol website. Copies of the manual will be openly accessible and free to download.
2. A further training session for managers in the three original partner local authorities will be arranged, with the aim of consolidating the use of C-Change in practice.
3. At the time of writing, a number of local authorities have expressed an interest in adopting the C-Change approach. The University of Bristol is taking forward opportunities of this kind by offering training and consultancy (on a fee-paid basis). Funding is being sought for a 'training the trainers' project to support this work.
4. Further dissemination is being arranged via a number of organisations dedicated to promoting good practice in social work.
5. The Department for Education has been informed of the work, and will be updated as appropriate.
6. Further in-depth evaluation of C-Change would be desirable, and the University of Bristol is working on suitable grant applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0FF27743-EA7C-4C54-B5C9-8993E2BEB5F3</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://bristol.ac.uk/capacity-to-change</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C4D8C885-E997-4862-9D10-CA01EB08B7C9"><gtr:id>C4D8C885-E997-4862-9D10-CA01EB08B7C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Assessing parental capacity to change: The missing jigsaw piece in the assessment of a child's welfare?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Children and Youth Services Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d9dbd66c6fabf032902200de4929b0c1"><gtr:id>d9dbd66c6fabf032902200de4929b0c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Platt D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7CC10A19-6532-4C73-B516-8349A5C07F67"><gtr:id>7CC10A19-6532-4C73-B516-8349A5C07F67</gtr:id><gtr:title>C-Change Capacity to Change Assessment Manual - Scottish version</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d9dbd66c6fabf032902200de4929b0c1"><gtr:id>d9dbd66c6fabf032902200de4929b0c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Platt D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-9933828-3-3</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/712037E0-4F6C-488E-ABC5-53B48E102C8F"><gtr:id>712037E0-4F6C-488E-ABC5-53B48E102C8F</gtr:id><gtr:title>C-Change Capacity to Change Assessment Manual</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d9dbd66c6fabf032902200de4929b0c1"><gtr:id>d9dbd66c6fabf032902200de4929b0c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Platt D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-9560194-1-7</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AD20BFAF-A903-4C72-AD5F-35252C13010E"><gtr:id>AD20BFAF-A903-4C72-AD5F-35252C13010E</gtr:id><gtr:title>How Social Workers Assess Parental Capacity to Change</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d9dbd66c6fabf032902200de4929b0c1"><gtr:id>d9dbd66c6fabf032902200de4929b0c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Platt D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L001829/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D8C04024-FB47-49BA-9905-98DD5083D92E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Children and Families</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
