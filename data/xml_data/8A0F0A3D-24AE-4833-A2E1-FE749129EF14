The research undertaken and its findings will be of interest and/or benefit to:

(1) Government departments and other bodies with interests in monitoring labour market inequality, public sector employment and service provision, and local variations in public sector pay. These include HM Treasury, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), the department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), and the Public Sector Pay Review Boards.
(2) Devolved Governments and Unitary Authorities of the UK concerned with the effects of reduced spending in the public sector on regional wage differentials and on the spatial distribution of economic prosperity.
(3) Representatives of public sector workers in the UK: UNISON, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, NUT and NASUWT and the TUC. 

The proposed research directly addresses issues of labour market equality for a number of groups in the UK that are likely to be affected unequally by the changes proposed in the public sector. Issues of specific interest to the groups identified include:

(1) The magnitude and distribution of job losses in the public/private sector and the implications of these job losses, particularly on subsequent economic status and earnings, and their impact on the regions of the UK and equality groups. 
(2) The size and nature of public/private sector wage differentials for different equality groups employed in different areas of the UK and in different parts of the public sector.
(3) Variations in public sector pay across the earnings distribution; how this has changed over time, and implications that changes in public sector pay have for the recruitment and retention of staff.
(4) The effect of job losses and restrictions on pay increases in the public sector on regional earnings differences and on the gender and ethnic wage gap.
(5) The differences between, and changes to, broader measures of the job quality in the public sector and private sectors.

Early dissemination of findings to policy makers will be achieved though the auspices of WISERD Policy Briefings, seminars/workshop presentations to key stakeholders groups, blogs and the production of an in-house (virtual) newsletter.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156854</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Melanie Jones 24.6.14 'Is the Public Sector Pay Advantage Explained by Differences in Work Quality?'

This was at a time when the public sector accounted for 21 per cent of total employment and the public sector wage bill accounted for 30 per cent of government expenditure. 

Politically, this strategy has been relatively easy to implement given the common perception that public sector workers are privileged in terms of their pensions, pay, working conditions and job quality. Indeed, some of have suggested workers in the public sector are 'more than 40% better off' than those in the private sector and that this has increased during the recession. 

The project's key findings have relevance for this debate and the claims and counterclaims which surround it. These include the following: 

1. Using the Labour Force Survey (LFS) (1994-2012) the project shows that the public sector premium has fallen with the sharpest fall occurring before 2007. However, a public sector pay premium, although decreasing, remains for women and low paid workers. Compared to workers in the private sector, high paid workers in the public sector do consistently worse than their private sector counterparts and there is evidence that 'worker quality' in the public sector has fallen overtime. 

2. Using the LFS the project shows that regional variations in the public sector wage premium have been exaggerated; although problems for the recruitment and retention of public sector workers still remain in London and the South East, primarily because the pay of public sector workers in these areas tends to be lower than otherwise equivalent private sector workers. 

3. Using the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) and the LFS (1993-2007) the project shows that the impact of pay settlements determined by the Pay Review Bodies on the annual change in wages for ten occupational groups has been negligible. 

4. Using the Skills and Employment Survey series (1997, 2001, 2006 and 2012) the project does not find evidence to support the anticipated public sector double premium of better wages and better quality work. Instead, the raw public sector pay premium tends to compensate for differences in the intrinsic features of work. 

5. Women and disabled people are over-represented in the public sector (37% of female and 32% of disabled employees work within the public sector compared to 29% overall in 2013). Using the LFS 1998-2013, the project shows that the wage gaps for both these protected groups are lower in the public sector. More detailed analysis for the gender pay gap indicates a narrowing trend in both sectors which stalls from 2010.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Future work may usefully consider differences that emerge within the public sector such as how the gender pay gap varies across occupations. 
2. Subsequent analysis which compares work in the public and private sectors should examine further indicators of job quality and the wider experience of work to provide a more complete picture of sector differences than evidence which focuses solely on pay.
3. Findings in relation to public-private sector differentials in job quality and outcome gaps (pay and job quality) for protected groups provide an important contribution to evidence considered by Pay Review Bodies. 
4. Findings challenge popular media accounts that 'the grass is greener' for workers in the public sector.
5. Work representing expected outputs from the project but not yet in final form also include an investigation of sectorial differences in earnings across central and local government; differences in over and under-skilling in the public and private sectors and their impact on earnings; and difference in outcomes between public and private sector workers other than those measured directly by earnings and the associated effects of job quality.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>792DE8A7-3E75-4F66-9DF4-7C5C93391D36</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and
