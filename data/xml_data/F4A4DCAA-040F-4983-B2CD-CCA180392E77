&lt;p>A natural way to model heterogeneous trading relationships is to represent the economy as a network, where a link between two agents describes the feasibility of an exchange.

There is also attention from central banks with respect to financial networks, and the need to develop better tools and theories to understand the stability of financial networks. The aim of this conference was to bring together some of the most interesting research that is currently being done in these subjects.

Participants included practitioners, academics and many PhD student from UK institution and European Institutions. The event has created lot of interest on the different topics of network economics.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The two research papers we have completed are theoretical in nature.

Markets are defined by the characteristics of the good being traded, the information possessed by the agents, and the interaction technology. Relationship specific characteristics, such as the geographical localization of the partners and the reciprocal reputation, are generally abstracted away. We model heterogeneous trading relationships by representing the economy as a network, where the presence of a link between two agents is interpreted as anything that allows or facilitates trade. 



The first contribution of our project is methodological. We provide a general framework to study both the patterns of trade that arise in economies, described as trading networks, and the endogenous formation of trading networks. The model is general and allows for incorporation of a wide range of different forms of trade institutions. The second contribution is the study of two specific models, each belonging to our general framework. The first model studies the trade of an object in a given network when negotiations are conducted bilaterally. The second model studies the formation of trading networks and the extent to which they depart from efficient trading networks under ex-post efficient allocations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work we have conducted in this proposal has led two research papers. These papers are having influence in the profession and are becoming one of the first outputs in the literature of strategic intermediation in networks. This is a very active area of research at the moment. I have been recently invited to edit an Handbook Chapter on this topic.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>32671DF2-2B65-461C-9DB0-EBE2118CBEF6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/08FF9B60-ADF0-4824-9BA0-B0E8114DACBF"><gtr:id>08FF9B60-ADF0-4824-9BA0-B0E8114DACBF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bilateral Trading in Networks</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Working Paper Essex</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b20d4e328e042d25fb9835821b8937a9"><gtr:id>b20d4e328e042d25fb9835821b8937a9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Galeotti A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A377D3A6-544F-48A0-9709-C1DF215E203A"><gtr:id>A377D3A6-544F-48A0-9709-C1DF215E203A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Endogenous Trading Networks</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Working Paper Essex</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b20d4e328e042d25fb9835821b8937a9"><gtr:id>b20d4e328e042d25fb9835821b8937a9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Galeotti A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/H027777/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3902</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
