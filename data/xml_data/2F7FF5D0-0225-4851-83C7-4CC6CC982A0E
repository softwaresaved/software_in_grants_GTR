However it is unclear to what extent such results can be generalized across conflicts and what other factors may affect the direction and intensity of these effects. Beyond the type of investment, it is also not clear how changes in conflict intensity affect the growth of investment and firm size.
This research aims to provide comparative evidence by improving our understanding of the impact of violent conflict on investment in entrepreneurial activities with different growth potentials. Methodology will consist in building a new dataset matching and harmonizing household surveys and violent conflict events for fragile and conflict states (FCS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We will investigate how conflict affects the type of private investments by households - type of activity, firm size, and returns to investment - and how institutional, geographical, and individual characteristics influence this entrepreneurial choice. We will also investigate how changes in conflict intensity affect firm growth in size, investment, and profits. This project will make a number of crucial academic and policy contributions. Firstly, it will shift the focus from the effect of conflict on the number of entrepreneurial activities to the composition of entrepreneurial activities with different growth potentials. Secondly, it will improve on the identification of the average effect of conflict on entrepreneurial activity and private sector development at the micro level. Thirdly, it will improve substantially our understanding of the institutional, geographical and conflict related factors that mediate the impact of conflict on entrepreneurial activity. Furthermore, the inclusion of a large set of countries will allow to test for the external validity of these effects across several countries and types of conflict on which no such evidence exists. All these achievement will be obtained through an approach that will credibly identify the causality of conflict on economic activity through the use of a novel instrumental variable strategy and exploiting a new household panel dataset. Lastly, and more importantly, we will be able to test the effect of conflict as a barrier to firm growth in size and investment.
This research adds to a debate on pressing social and policy issues: conflict and economic growth. It is therefore particularly relevant not only for the academic community, but also for policy makers, peace builders and peace keepers, NGOs operating in the field, employers, public, social and private enterprises, trade unions, training institutions and young and old members of the workforce that seek and use information on employment and investment decisions. Our dissemination plan ensures that the findings of our research reach all the above stakeholders to inform their decision-making processes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WIDER BENEFICIARIES 
The findings are of direct relevance for African, international and national government bodies that aim at fostering entrepreneurship, development and increasing conflict resilience (including Departments of Industry, Trade and Investment; Labour and Employment; Finance; Commissions on Corporate affairs; World Bank; African Development Bank; Development and Sahel and West Africa Club Department at OECD; and regional groups (e.g. Southern African Development Coordination Conference), employers, i.a. Entrepreneurs Unions, civil society pressure groups on conflict and peacekeeping, the third sector, including major funders with a focus on poverty and inequality and donor organisations e.g. Oxfam. 
The results from the project will support all these stakeholders to articulate responses to the effects of conflict in the private sector induced by the highest risk attached to investments in private productive activities. The research will inform evidence-based policy to fine-tune incentives for firms and entrepreneurs to invest more capital, fuelling economic growth, while at the same time increasing inclusion, improving employment, and reducing income inequality.

ENGAGING WITH USERS THROUGH DISSEMINATION, COLLABORATION AND CAPACITY BUILDING
The project team itself having long been engaged with organizations that have contacts with members of committees in government, international bodies and NGO experts, represents an excellent platform of joint academic excellence (SPRU and the School of Global Studies at the University of Sussex) and policy impact (World Bank, IPCR, PeaceDirect) to ensure the widest benefit in terms of academic and non-academic impact. This will be done through three engagement and three dissemination events across SSA, policy reports and research briefs, and an advisory commission on policy action with stakeholders included in the project activities (IPCR, World Bank, PeaceDirect). 
The collaboration with PeaceDirect will be essential as the organization will commit to disseminate results from the research across different countries, translating the policy messages in other languages. Also SPRU, the School of Global studies, IPCR, and PeaceDirect teams have long-standing experience in academic and non-academic dissemination. 

RELEVANCE
The topic addressed by this research is of utmost relevance and has entered the frontline of both UK and international debate following the recent publication of the UNCTAD Report (2015), which suggests that entrepreneurship plays a crucial role in creating conditions that will bring stability to communities and foster peace. The project will produce high quality academic research through the usage of different datasets, and it will focus specifically on the decision about the type of entrepreneurship conducted, the level of employee hired and the amount of capital invested.
The findings will allow engaged stakeholders to increase awareness about the relevant aspects of the current impact of insecurity on private activity, intervene in defence of the weakest groups in society, and lobby by informing about the best-practices for targeting the main effects of conflict on entrepreneurship. 
For similar reasons the findings will highly benefit the actions of entrepreneur unions, as well as peacekeeping and peacebuilding organizations, particularly with reference to dimensions of post-conflict poverty and directly connected with employment, earnings, education and skills.
While the stakeholders mentioned above will benefit from the research directly, our purpose is to have a wider impact on the society. We hope that a clearer understanding of the different competing mechanisms will inform policies to lower firm failures in the mid to long term. We hope to stimulate further research and data analysis and collection, which will further inform decision making beyond the continental level.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>163533</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P003710/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA017EDD-C008-4338-ABE2-A7D9EEA68E82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1DB39325-6FA5-460A-B093-91A5EEF6EB97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Bus Studies &amp; Dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
