Unfortunately, turbulence remains ``the most important unsolved problem of classical physics''. It consists of a wide range of three-dimensional motions, from large and slow to small and fast. The smallest (and most rapid) motions dissipate the kinetic energy of the flow and determine drag on bodies, dispersion of pollutants and chemical mixing. Unfortunately the very smallness of these motions has, until recently, made them inaccessible to both experiments and computations in flows of practical importance. Predictions of turbulent flows have thus been based on uncertain theories and models of these ``fine scales which are assumed to be the same for all flows i.e. universal. No-one knows if this is true or not. Answering this question requires measurements of a range of flows using techniques capable of resolving their full structure in space as it evolves in time. New techniques developed by the applicants have, for the first time, made the full measurement of these motions possible. Similar advances in computational methods has provided the opportunity for meaningful comparisons with such measurements.In this collaborative initiative between Imperial College London, the University of Cambridge and the University of Southampton, we aim to develop and employ a series of advanced laser diagnostic techniques to measure the time-resolved, three-dimensional features of the fine-scales in a series of `canonical' turbulent shear flows in order to test the hypothesis of universality. Measurements will also be taken at Reynolds numbers accessible to Direct Numerical Simulations especially carried out with this purpose for cross-comparison and validation. The experimental techniques will be based on cinematographic scanning and tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques. Regardless of whether the universality hypothesis holds or not, the necessary information to formulate physics based fine-scale models that can account for the multi-scale interactions will be obtained. The data as well as the 3D PIV software will be made available online for researchers in the UK and around the world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>733055</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this projects was to investigate the long-standing idea that turbulent flows in different situations share common statistics and structure that is universal to all turbulent flows and therefore should enable us to predict them. To understand them we need to be able to accurately measure the acceleration field in time and space, as defined by the velocity gradient tensor. Several important impacts have been developed.
1) A novel variant of scanning tomographic PIV was developed, providing a step change in our ability to make accurate time-resolved 3D measurements at high Reynolds number to date. In fact, this was the first time that the measurement resolution could rival those obtained through direct numerical simulations (DNS). 
2) We developed a new methodology to test the fidelity and optimise measurements through the use of DNS data bases bridging two important communities which often work separately
3) We further demonstrated that our method can be applied to a broader range of flow regimes than expected (we discovered that it was not necessary to scan at a rate to freeze the flow and could make equally reliable measurements a lower scanning rates).
4) We conducted a series of experiments in a number of flows to reveal the structure and statistics of small-scale turbulence closely adhered to the idea of universality but that a refined definition is needed.
5) We demonstrated that the scale-dependence of turbulent entrainment follows scaling laws consistent with fractal behaviour and that the rate of mass entrainment is scale-invariant.
6) Gained new physical insights into the structure and dynamics of small-scale turbulence which could vastly improve existing turbulence models.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) we have distributed our codes and methods to leading research groups and collaborators
2) the techniques can be extended to many other turbulent flows of interest to both the scientific community and industry
3) the project has opened the door to realistic comparisons between experiments and simulations which will unleash new collaborative possibilities in turbulence/fluid mechanics research</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C71FD5A4-16E1-4DA7-A35D-E299593A683E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/54CC61EF-FCE3-4001-A5C1-3A8EAF5A49CD"><gtr:id>54CC61EF-FCE3-4001-A5C1-3A8EAF5A49CD</gtr:id><gtr:title>On velocity gradient dynamics and turbulent structure</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Fluid Mechanics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/351845e89a66ac82aa774ee47750888d"><gtr:id>351845e89a66ac82aa774ee47750888d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F0AC644E-B3D7-4F65-A3D0-D82E09A21B5E"><gtr:id>F0AC644E-B3D7-4F65-A3D0-D82E09A21B5E</gtr:id><gtr:title>A scanning PIV method for fine-scale turbulence measurements</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experiments in Fluids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/351845e89a66ac82aa774ee47750888d"><gtr:id>351845e89a66ac82aa774ee47750888d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/033CDF3D-B628-47D3-9FFC-E523ECEA188B"><gtr:id>033CDF3D-B628-47D3-9FFC-E523ECEA188B</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the drag of turbulent vortex rings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Fluid Mechanics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5e9266a633fef32045b1daef8a262a6b"><gtr:id>5e9266a633fef32045b1daef8a262a6b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gan L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AC741DCD-B496-46D6-A1CE-EC9CD0C7949A"><gtr:id>AC741DCD-B496-46D6-A1CE-EC9CD0C7949A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Invariants of the reduced velocity gradient tensor in turbulent flows</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Fluid Mechanics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2a63dab83735c53e6c11f355d7cd99cc"><gtr:id>2a63dab83735c53e6c11f355d7cd99cc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cardesa J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1ACEDDC3-F2BB-44AD-870D-F205BC5064D0"><gtr:id>1ACEDDC3-F2BB-44AD-870D-F205BC5064D0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The formation of turbulent vortex rings by synthetic jets</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physics of Fluids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/351845e89a66ac82aa774ee47750888d"><gtr:id>351845e89a66ac82aa774ee47750888d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I005897/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ED6338AE-3457-45D6-90CA-B994C3CF422B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Aerodynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
