disorders</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J020893/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project involves a comprehensive investigation of witness skills in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These children are highly vulnerable due to their age and their developmental disability, yet there is virtually no research in this area to guide criminal justice professionals on their potential strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The current project adopts an experimental procedure to examine how children with ASD fare across all stages of a criminal investigation (during initial questioning, in an investigative interview, when identifying perpetrators, and during cross-examination) relative to typical children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will also consider several related questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Can we improve the amount of information that children recall, without a subsequent decrease in accuracy (eg, using the assistance of an intermediary)?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do members of the general public (who may evaluate the evidence of children with ASD within a jury) perceive witnesses with ASD?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Which factors (eg, language, general memory, suggestibility) are associated with the performance of children with ASD in a witness context?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The findings will be used to promote appropriate access to justice for children with ASD, and to develop new guidelines on best practice for interviewing children with ASD throughout the stages of criminal proceedings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will bring together theory and practice concerning access to justice for children with ASD, whilst at all times adopting an approach of high-level user engagement. 

ASD affects 1 in 100 individuals (Baird, et al., 2006) and has an estimated cost to the UK economy of over 28 billion pounds a year (Knapp, Romeo, &amp;amp; Beecham, 2009). Research aimed at reducing the difficulties experienced by this group is therefore a major public policy issue and could have a significant impact on reducing the economic burden of the disorder. 

The findings of the proposed research will be disseminated to a wide audience, including academics and researchers, criminal justice professionals (e.g., police officers, barristers, intermediaries), clinicians, and parents/carers of children with ASD. This will be achieved through a range of activities, including the publication of academic and non-academic research papers, presenting the work at academic and practitioner/user conferences, and hosting seminars for academics and practitioners/users. Of particular note, we will collaborate with the National Autistic Society to develop evidence-based guidelines on 'Access to justice in children with ASD' for criminal justice professionals. These important guidelines will be widely advertised (e.g., by disseminating the guidelines to professional organisations, and hosting the recommendations on the National Autistic Society website). We will actively seek input, advice and guidance on the findings of the project (as well as the associated guidelines and resources that we seek to produce) from relevant user groups. Adopting a dialectic approach, we aim to incorporate feedback and advice concerning aspects of the project into our non-academic and academic outputs. We envisage the results and guidelines will be widely cited within professional practice, as well as being of interest to academics conducting further work in this area. 

An important sustainable resource to be developed from this project will be a website dedicated to access to justice in children with ASD. This will host information for user groups and academics, and will include a range of resources developed as part of the project (e.g., best practice guidelines for witnesses with ASD, information on memory for events in ASD, publications arising from the project). Details about the project and associated outcomes will also be presented on the website of the National Autistic Society and other ASD websites, to reach a larger, more targeted audience.

We envisage that there will be significant media interest in this research, given recent high profile cases of individuals with ASD in legal settings (e.g., Gary McKinnon). We will therefore work with ESRC to prepare press releases concerning relevant aspects of the research that showcase the key findings and their impact on society. 

This work will also have an impact on future research on access to justice, by providing a framework by which to explore this topic in individuals with intellectual disabilities and/or other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Down syndrome). 

In summary, our impact work will involve a wide range of activities that will be relevant to a range of academic and non-academic groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>376525</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bath</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Psychology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Academic collaboration - University of Bath</gtr:description><gtr:id>87E9DB21-DF7E-4D9B-BFB6-43E1D85DB2C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Survey study on the police and autism community to gauge perspectives on autism and policing.

Two large-scale awareness raising impact events on autism and policing - these events were specifically designed for police officers in order to raise awareness about: autism; how to interview those with autism; and how to use Registered Intermediaries to assist with investigations. Immediately following the second event, one attending delegate was nominated as the Islington Police lead on autism. 

The new National Autistic Society guidelines on autism and policing (forthcoming).</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners in the Metropolitan Police Service organised for three members of our research team to attend Investigative Interviewing training at a police training centre in 2013. They also created the identification line-ups used in the research. Further, a Superintendent worked directly with us on one of our juror perception studies. 

Our partners at the Metropolitan Police helped us design and run two large-scale awareness raising impact events on autism and policing. They also undertook the advertising and registration process for these events and ensured that the widest possible range of officers from different commands were in attendance (total number of officers attending across the two events was about 250). 

One of our key impact outcomes was to help revise the existing National Autistic Society guide ('Autism: a guide for criminal justice professionals'). We did this in collaboration with our partners at the Metropolitan Police Service, co-writing the new guide with the National Autistic Society ('Autism: a guide for police officers). Our colleagues at the Met highlighted what worked well for them in the previous guide and what required improvement. They also commented on drafts of the final document and will liaise with us shortly to ensure the widest possible dissemination of the final version of the guide within the Metropolitan Police Service. This guide is due for publication later in 2017.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Recognising the significance of our research findings for police practice, we contacted the Head of Investigative Training at the Metropolitan Police Service to jointly deliver two separate awareness raising impact events designed specifically for police officers (for the Met and five other national police forces). These events were focused on raising awareness about autism as a disorder, how to interview individuals with autism, and the role that Registered Intermediaries can play in assisting with police interviews and other phases of a criminal investigation. Experts on autism, police officers with specialist knowledge of how to interview witnesses/suspects with autism, and a team of experienced, practicing Registered Intermediaries gave lectures and workshops to large audiences of police officers.
