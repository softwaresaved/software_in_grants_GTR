The BBC had identified a series of themes for examination at local level. In my case, I was co-adviser for BBC South with Dr Helen McCartney. The radio stations involved were Radio Berkshire, Radio Oxford, Radio Solent, and parts of Radio Sussex and Radio Wiltshire. Initially, potential stories on the local impacts of the Great War were identified for the journalists and primary and secondary sources suggested ( as well as some potential academic interviewees also identified). Stories were also generated by the journalists themselves, at which point additional guidance was given. Radio Oxford was especially proactive in this regard, the others less so. Once stories were developed and prepared, advice was given to correct potential errors in the interpretation before consent forms were signed off for broadcast and putting on the website. On occasions I was interviewed for broadcast pieces both for BBC South and also for other participating local radio stations countrywide. The division of Buckinghamshire between BBC South and BBC East was problematic in terms of coverage.
 
Generally, the project was of value in highlighting local issues relating to the impact of the Great War although it might be the case that the website will be of greater use given that most of the stories were broadcast locally in the early mornings. The project will have informed local communities of some perhaps unexpected links to the war.
Overall, it was informative for Dr McCarthy and myself in allowing us to participate in the production process.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FD254695-7862-47DE-A286-D4681BB01E53</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L503629/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
