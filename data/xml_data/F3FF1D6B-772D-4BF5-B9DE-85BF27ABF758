Because of this there is an urgent need to review the changing nature of decay processes, investigate the new, and developing, environmental conditions that are driving these changes and to scope their impacts on the future decay of masonry materials and any required modifications to specification and remediation strategies. Nowhere is this need more apparent than in the northwest of the UK. The fact that building stones, especially sandstones, already react so adversely and so rapidly to the moist, often salt rich environments found in this region (Smith et al. 2002), must inevitably raise fears of what could happen as a consequence of any increase in their time of wetness associated with projected warmer, wetter and possibly longer winters. In short, in response to changing climate and pollution it is likely that we will have to radically rethink our understanding of masonry decay and conservation.Quartz sandstones have been chosen to investigate these issues because they have proven to be susceptible to, and highly sensitive indicators of, subtle changes in moisture and temperature regimes, as well as pollution conditions. They also provide acid, open-textured conditions that favour algal colonisation. If stonework were to remain wetter for longer and not dry out either as frequently or as thoroughly as before, there are a number of physical and chemical effects that could be hypothesised. These include: the deeper penetration of salts (especially those of high mobility) and increased biological colonisation leading to active biological decay, both chemical and physical, as well as unsightly soiling of buildings that is expensive to remedy.This project will therefore build on earlier research into sandstone decay processes to investigate the likely impacts of predicted climate change on future decay. To do this, it will concentrate on the effects of changes in moisture regime on quartz sandstones. This will combine laboratory simulations with environmental monitoring and the assessment of decay patterns related to conditions of exposure on selected sandstone buildings, linked to sampling and analysis of complete stone blocks. Central to this is the construction of test walls in a wet environment in the west of Northern Ireland with embedded sensor systems to monitor thermal and moisture regimes linked to biological colonisation. This will be validated against laboratory investigations of the colonisation process and the feedbacks that could affect stone decay, together with investigations of ion diffusion associated with prolonged 'deep wetness' of masonry. Because of the detailed knowledge already possessed by the partnership, and the access to buildings undergoing renovation provided by the industrial collaborator, environmental monitoring and sampling will concentrate across Northern Ireland, supported by limited selective sampling of sandstone structures in Scotland and northwest England.Underpinning all investigations into stone per se, is the statistical downscaling of national and regional climate change scenarios, linked to measurements of stone condition and the factors controlling it. This novel approach is essential at a much wider scale if such scenarios are to be successfully translated into meaningful strategies for adaptation to environmental change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>403809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Amphora NDT</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Amphora Non-destructive Testing Ltd</gtr:description><gtr:id>30165E0C-B132-4EBC-AA74-D0220F270BC6</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>85791</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Follow on fund - Advanced structural health monitoring for stone masonry structures - bringing new technology closer to market</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/I006109/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>93665055-AEEB-463B-9989-FC069B7F8A25</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The impact of the work is realised in several ways: (i) The choice of new and replacement building sandstone for construction by identification of any pre-disposition to biological soiling and associated decay related to the environment into which it is to be placed / its fitness for purpose. (ii) Predicting the likely consequences of
conventional conservation strategies for sandstones, such as the removal of weathered surface layers, and the
consideration of alternative approaches for sandstones, including the appropriate choice and improved application of
biocides and water repellents. (iii) The design of structures to minimise the creation of microenvironments that favour rapid
biological soiling. It is intended that the results will encourage an appreciation amongst end users of the complex and changing nature of stone decay and the need to base stone selection and conservation on specific knowledge of the decay environment and an appreciation that this environment will not remain constant.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DF4772D1-1703-4761-AC54-97FF0A2ADFF9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A new sensor for measuring pH in cement and concrete was developed and patented.</gtr:description><gtr:id>24BB76E2-CC72-469E-A3A9-B6E2690F54E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This has resulted in a major grant for the development of microwave technology for curing novel cement systems.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Yes</gtr:licensed><gtr:patentId>GB1100989.1</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Development of optical fiber pH sensors for structural health monitoring</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2011</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project helped to find out how periods of prolonged, deep-seated wetness impact on the 'greening', deterioration and potential conservation of sandstone masonry. Fibre optic and electrical resistance sensors were adapted and used successfully for monitoring the moisture contents of sandstone test walls to quantify 'time of wetness' (both at
the surface and at depth) in the west of Northern Ireland and the data thus obtained was used to establish its relationship to greening. The project also helped to relate wetness regimes in
sandstone walls to existing climatic conditions and predict future wetness regimes in sandstone walls through
statistically downscaling climate projections and utilising links between wetness and climatic parameters discovered in
the project. The relationship between moisture levels and ion diffusion of key anions and cations within sandstone blocks was established and links between greening (algal colonisation) of sandstone blocks and moisture regimes led to the development of new conceptual models of sandstone deterioration under wetter, 'greener' conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The outcome of this work has both academic and industrial implications. For the first time, the time to wetness is related to biological colonisation on sandstones. In addition, the outcome has already been beneficial to conservation architects and engineers for putting forward the most appropriate intervention and repair or maintenance strategy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>80A1DB6E-66D2-4E60-AEB9-B45B1D68ADEB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4607E4CF-94B6-4DD8-BDC5-34C54D24A41E"><gtr:id>4607E4CF-94B6-4DD8-BDC5-34C54D24A41E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Climate change</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Materials Evaluation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6ba7c7fc27962e1e19c66907c8edbe67"><gtr:id>6ba7c7fc27962e1e19c66907c8edbe67</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith B.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>00255327</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BBF3C43F-FFC8-4CB4-AF51-F827DAFB7179"><gtr:id>BBF3C43F-FFC8-4CB4-AF51-F827DAFB7179</gtr:id><gtr:title>Optical fibre humidity sensor design for building stone condition monitoring</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/badce8f271711f50bfe5e76695979e8f"><gtr:id>badce8f271711f50bfe5e76695979e8f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sun T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4244-8170-5</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3079D122-1551-43F3-8E5D-1311DF364213"><gtr:id>3079D122-1551-43F3-8E5D-1311DF364213</gtr:id><gtr:title>Use of Fiber Optic and Electrical Resistance Sensors for Monitoring Moisture Movement in Building Stones Subjected to Simulated Climatic Conditions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of ASTM International</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/57a5bac4d4b718382548ada5acb0e489"><gtr:id>57a5bac4d4b718382548ada5acb0e489</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Srinivasan S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G01051X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0F0B5443-BE5E-4DB6-823E-B7E33EE35922</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil Engineering Materials</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
