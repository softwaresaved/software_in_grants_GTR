The two decades between 1955 and 1975 witnessed substantial changes within the Roman Catholic Church in the fields of theology and liturgy, with decisive effects on church architecture. It was also a period of transition in architecture more generally, from traditional and historical styles to modern design, a shift which profoundly affected the appearances of church buildings, even those by architecture firms which continued to operate throughout the period. This was also a period of massive urban transformations, as housing estates and New Towns were built to accommodate people moved out of city centres and into new communities. To follow these population movements the Roman Catholic Church undertook a vast building campaign of new churches, often seen as hubs of community and expressions of identity. \n\nThis project aims to examine all these factors by looking in detail at a selection of the many churches of the period. Of the hundreds built, few were published in any significant way at the time, and even fewer have been published since, so there is a current lack of available knowledge of this body of architecture. Many churches are architecturally innovative and historically interesting, but in danger of being demolished or altered as ideas about church architecture and the liturgy change again. This project will therefore raise awareness of this rich architectural and religious heritage, while analysing and interpreting the buildings according to their historical context.\n\nThe research involves surveys of selected case study buildings, predominantly in the centres and suburbs of major cities in England, Scotland and Wales. Historical investigation using periodicals and archives will aim to discover more about the architectural, institutional and social frameworks within which churches were produced. A research assistant will create survey drawings of some of the most significant buildings for publication, and collect other illustrative material. The principal investigator will write a book which deals with the subject thematically, drawing on a wide range of buildings, but studying the smaller number of selected case studies in greater depth. The book will be well illustrated to ensure that it can be used as a source of information by people in different academic and non-academic areas. Some of the images will also be included in a professionally-designed exhibition intended to take the research to the various communities in architecture and the Church who share an interest in this history. Articles in non-academic journals, including architecture and church magazines, will also be written to disseminate the research as widely as possible.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will be well received thanks to the current absence of any such serious and impartial study of the subject. Impact will be achieved through an exhibition targeted to architecture and church communities; a book which will appeal to heritage organisations and architects; and non-academic publications for readerships at various levels of interest in all these sectors.\n\nRoman Catholic Church: The Church maintains a substantial interest in its own past. For example, many individual diocese have recently published their own histories, which include the post-war period and also show a concern with church buildings. However there is now a tendency in the Church to return to pre-Vatican II ideals and style of liturgy, increasing the danger of losing post-war church buildings, while the ideas behind Vatican II also become oversimplified or misunderstood. There is therefore an acute need to look at the period around Vatican II with detachment in its historical specificity. The research project aims to promote the value of church buildings of this period as significant expressions of the Church's history, raising appreciation for them and their period. This will provide a direct cultural benefit to a particular community in Britain, in enriching its knowledge of its own past. The exhibition will be designed to bring the research to Church audiences, as it will be capable of being shown in non-traditional venues such as church vestibules and diocesan offices, and will consist of panels which can be selected for local relevance. Non-academic articles will be written for Church-related periodicals, and other literature such as church guides will be produced, aimed at different levels of audience to promote understanding of the architecture. The book will be written in a clear style and well illustrated so that it is accessible and appealing to audiences beyond the academic sphere.\n\nHeritage Organisations: Post-war architecture is currently being reevaluated by heritage organisations concerned with documentation and conservation of the historic environment. These include statutory bodies such as English Heritage and specialist organisations such as the Twentieth Century Society and Docomomo. English Heritage is conducting a study in partnership with dioceses to document all buildings owned by the Roman Catholic Church in England, although not all the reports will be published and the scope is limited to simple descriptions. Nevertheless the project shows how important the subject currently is, and shows a need for further work. Heritage bodies are also interested in social and historical aspects of architecture, and this research project will contribute significantly to the ways in which they understand this architecture, by engaging with a large body of built work, selecting specific important examples, and setting them into a historical context through detailed documentary research. This will have direct consequences for policy, for example in the listing and conservation of buildings of merit. It will also benefit culture generally in raising awareness of significant modern architecture and promoting further dissemination. The book is the primary means of achieving impact in this sphere, and non-academic articles will be written for magazines or newsletters where appropriate.\n\nArchitecture: Architects currently working on churches, the firms covered by the research and still continuing to practice, and architects within cities or regions specifically studied here will all benefit from the enriched knowledge of post-war modern architecture that this project will produce. For this audience, high quality architectural drawings will be made to present the most important thirty or so case studies in a comprehensible and comparative way. The exhibition will be offered to architecture schools or architecture centres in relevant p</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>135511</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Course/Seminar, 'Places of Worship in Britain and Ireland, 1929-1990', Oxford University, 27-29 Jan 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B02F1515-CDFB-48EB-B34C-3F54CA359BB9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited lecture, 'Architecture, Society and Religion in the Roman Catholic Parish', at weekend course/seminar open to the general public, Oxford University, Dept of Continuing Education.

Wordpress was chosen to create the site because of its simplicity and the ease with which any viewer could sign up to receive news by email. In the first instance, in accordance with the AHRC project application, it has been devised simply as a pointer to the various kinds of research outcome and to collect information on the project from other sources. Wherever an outcome is available on the internet, a link has been inserted to take visitors to it. 



Prominent links to the website have been created on the Glasgow School of Art website, on other blogs, through email announcements, in press releases and by exhibition venue websites. The website is a key method of guaging the level of public interest in the project, as visitor numbers and origins can be captured more easily than through the exhibition. 



It is possible that the website could develop into an output in its own right at a later stage of the project - we are considering whether the exhibition case studies might be put up here after its run, for example.

We responded with a detailed assessment of the building's significance. The case was taken up by the Twentieth Century Society, who recommended the building for listing; it was then listed by English Heritage in December 2011 at Grade II. English Heritage's report on its listing decision incorporated much of the assessment sent by us. The Manchester Modernist Society sent out press releases which brought mention of the case in the local and national press.

It brought together nine case study buildings from the research, presented through new and archival photography, new survey drawings, and quotations from original documents of the period. The aim was to explain modern Roman Catholic church architecture to a general audience to raise greater awareness of its historical importance. The exhibition was designed by Collective Architecture in Glasgow, with the aim of allowing it to be shown in non-gallery spaces such as churches. In its showing in Glasgow at the Lighthouse architecture centre it was accompanied with projections showing Scottish churches of the period. The exhibition was organised according to three themes: Tradition and Modernity; Devotion and Liturgy; and Church and City. It received limited press interest but news was circulated to architects and parish churches in each area and each show drew a significant audience from both sectors. The first showings of the exhibition were timed to coincide with Doors Open Days in Glasgow and Heritage Open Days in Liverpool to maximise audiences. The open nature of most venues precluded collecting visitor figures, but figures were obtained from the Lighthouse and showed over 6,000 visits.

The exhibition was initially shown in two venues in parallel. One version was displayed at the Lighthouse centre for architecture and design in Glasgow.

It was one of three talks presented at this conference, the others being on Pugin and on recent church reordering. The event was attended by church and conservation architects, architectural historians including staff at English Heritage and architectural history consultants, senior clergy involved in church heritage, diocesan surveyors and other staff. 



The talk attempted to explain the mechanisms of reform, showing how networks of architects and clergy had built up the case for reform in church architecture and liturgy together for a decade before the Second Vatican Council. Key case study buildings and people were used as ways of drawing together a narrative of significant buildings, publications and formative events that matured in the church architecture that followed Vatican II.

It has been used by the Architectural History Practice, for example, who have been commissioned by Historic England to undertake diocese-by-diocese surveys of Roman Catholic church properties to assess their heritage significance. It has also been used by the Twentieth Century Society to augment their own documentation of British church architecture (including a new online database), and to investigate potential applications for listing. In Manchester and London, bus tours were organised by heritage groups (Manchester Modernist Society, Twentieth Century Society) of local modern churches, partly following and inspired by the book. The book has been sold not just to academic libraries but also through the Twentieth Century Society (which reviewed it in its magazine), to heritage professionals and architects as well as the general public interested in modern architecture. New interest in this topic has led to renewed conservation efforts. For example, at the church of St Thomas More in Sheldon, recently listed, the parishioners were awarded a Heritage Lottery Fund grant for repair and conservation work, and the PI was invited to talk to parishioners and the conservation architect about the building, raising greater appreciation for its design qualities. Publication work continues, for example with a recent commission received by the PI to research and write a book chapter on the stained glass artist Charles Norris, a monk of Buckfast Abbey, to be published in a book on the Abbey's art and architecture in 2017 for a mainstream publisher, both for general sale but also for the Abbey itself to sell and distribute to supporters.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D61F56EC-40FC-45CA-92FC-541AC48869ED</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Roman Catholic church architecture of the period 1955 to 1975 has rarely been studied in any depth, and the AHRC grant for this project enabled a consolidation of the PI Robert Proctor's research to date and extension through new detailed research on specific case study buildings. New findings included, for example:



- Correspondence about a new church showing a crisis over its perceived traditionalism, motivated by parishioners' complaints;

- A parish council's detailed preparations for briefing an architect and statements about their negotiations with the architect;

- Architects' development sketches for an important church with an innovative plan;

- Photographs of a church reputed for its liturgical advances showing it in use for the liturgy shortly after its construction, confirming suspicions that liturgical practices had not yet advanced as far as the building suggested;

- Discovery of two little-known buildings by a significant church architect of the period;

- Records of decisions about churches amongst New Town planners, showing how churches were allocated sites in new developments.

- Discovery and acquisition of a modest archive of a highly productive architectural practice specialising in churches, which will eventually be deposited in a publicly accessible repository.



These and other findings have given a complex historical picture of the movement from traditional to modern church architecture and of the development of liturgical innovation in relation to church planning; and also further information on the relationships of new churches to changes in city contexts and urban planning.



Major outputs so far have included:



- A conference paper for the European Architectural History Network annual conference;

- A travelling exhibition that visited numerous churches and other venues, many of them significant buildings of the period, including Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.


- A book by Robert Proctor, 'Church in Concrete: Roman Catholic Church Architecture in Britain, 1955 to 1975', published by Ashgate in 2014.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One of the most important results of the findings has been their application to heritage conservation, most notably in the Twentieth Century Society and Historic England's approaches to listing buildings of significance.
