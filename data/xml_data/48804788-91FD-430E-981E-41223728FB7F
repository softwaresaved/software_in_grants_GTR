Focusing on Anglophone Caribbean literature in the twentieth century, I survey and interpret the rich web of meanings that have been imputed to the cultures of Ancient Greece and Rome by Caribbean writers, intellectuals and politicians. The book's central premise is that many motifs in Caribbean literature that are commonly associated with African and modem European traditions and origins also reveal complex, circuitous dialogues with Greco-Roman antiquity. 
Although these dialogues are complex and circuitous, the book suggests that engagement with the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome in Anglophone Caribbean literature reflect distinctive local cultural, historical, and institutional practices. The Introduction ('Goodbye to Hellas') confronts the widespread assumption that, where present in the Caribbean, Classics is part of the inveterate legacy of the cultural imperialism practiced by colonial governments in the region. 1 counter this assumption with the evidence of ways in which Caribbean writers and intellectuals have routed their approaches to Greece and Rome through local idioms to come up with revisionist readings that make sense of these texts in the light of modem Caribbean experience, and vice versa. 
Chapter 1 &amp;quot;Accidental Homer: accidents of Homeric reception in the modem Caribbean&amp;quot; examines how conspicuous Caribbean representations of Homer in the twentieth century / most obviously Derek Walcott's Omeros and The Odyssey: A Stage Version / combine divergent and, indeed, contingent acts of classical reception (from Victorian travel writing through to modern Greek philhettenism). 
Chapter 2 ('Rejection / on not knowing Latin and Greek in t\/1odem Caribbean Literature&amp;quot;) examines the educational institutions through which the classics were taught in the modem Caribbean and the ways in which the discipline reflected colonial authority. The close association between classics and colonialism helps to explain, in part, the rejection of classics as a function of regional Independence movements. 
The flip-side of 'rejection' is assimilation. Chapter 3 &amp;quot;Assimilation the Athens of the Caribbean: Trinidadian Models of Athenian Democracy&amp;quot; explores the invention of new ways of using classics in the context of the Caribbean. Specifically, I use studies of three Trinidadian writers to examine how ancient Greece and Rome, and Athenian democracy in particular, were reinvented in pre- and post-Independence Trinidad and Tobago. 
Since this research project examines dialogues between both Greek and Roman Classics and Caribbean literature. Chapter 4 ('Beyond Rome: New Word Innovations') addresses the question of the differential uses of Greece and Rome in the modem Caribbean. 1 argue that Rome and Latin literature are closer to home, for a number of reasons including the Latin of the Catholic church, and the fact that the teaching of Latin was far more widespread than the teaching of Greek in Caribbean schools. However, this closeness also resulted in distance, insofar as Latin was associated with colonial and education discipline. 
Chapter 5 (&amp;quot;Writing back to Greece') revisits a topic that is covered in passing in Chapter 1: the significance of modern Greece for the Caribbean. This chapter looks at instances where Caribbean writers have had recourse to modern Greece to sidestep the hierarchical relationship between an Old world Greece and a New World Caribbean. The book's Conclusion evaluates the implications of this research for the contemporary discipline of Classics and offers have case studies that suggest how the findings of this book might affect the kinds of questions that are posed of Greek and Roman texts and future research directions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-01-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18046</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D50127X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FED118D3-C8D1-42BF-829F-C2CD1390FF49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>89068F3B-44C7-45D9-92CB-8BE148301439</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Reception</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>470B20F0-5FD1-4AA6-8809-5E2780CBDB18</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
