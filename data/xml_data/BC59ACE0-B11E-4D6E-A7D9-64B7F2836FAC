series tackles the important societal issue of marketplace exclusion: the mechanisms through which individuals and communities are barred from the resources and opportunities provided by the marketplace to the average citizen. It explores how marketplace exclusion operates within UK society and what measures we might take to help counter it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The series brings together leading scholars, early career researchers, and relevant user groups that are interested in the intersections between marketplace participation and other social categories, in particular community cohesion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The final seminar in the series will take the form of a theatre production with ten unemployed (NEETS) young people. Using findings from the previous five seminars the production will be designed to explore individuals' everyday experiences of alienation from the marketplace and create a response through theatre. The performance will be followed by a practitioner workshop involving the cast, local organisations and academics/practitioners from earlier seminars. The performance and workshop will uphold or challenge the issues discussed in earlier seminars. It will also allow excluded consumers to find a voice and find new and positive ways to understand themselves and their communities. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The strength of the series resides in the wide range of links with stakeholder communities that the eight investigators bring to the project. These include businesses, policy makers, charities and media representatives. The inclusion of Sue Moffat from New Vic Borderlines also means that the series will be well represented in the local community of Stoke-on-Trent drawing on her established links to community groups, community leaders and youth services. In summary the impacts will be as follows:

1. Enhancing understanding and knowledge of the concept of marketplace exclusion in society to ensure that blame is not placed at the level of individuals but rather wider mechanisms of exclusion.
2. Contributing positively to marketing practice in how consumers are represented in digital marketing, advertising and marketing research.
3. Contributing to public policy debates on marketplace exclusion at local, regional and national levels.
4. Promoting a powerful methodology for co-designing and co-producing knowledge with local communities.
5. Engaging excluded groups by giving them a voice and a role in rethinking the above grassroots and policy responses.

Below is a summary of the groups that will benefit from the seminars along with the ways in which they might benefit.

Seminars 1 and 2 (marketing practitioners, in particular market researchers, advertisers and digital marketers).
In seminar 1 we will be exploring the mechanisms that exclude consumers in both marketing theory and practice. In seminar 2 we will extend these debates into the realm of digital marketing. In particular we will interrogate and build on the recent government 'Consumer Empowerment Strategy' (Department for Business Innovation and Skills, BIS 2011) and MiData initiative. The seminar will build on Nottingham University's reputation as a centre of research into the digital economy supported by the Horizon Institute.

Seminar 3 (community shops, community exchange initiatives, charitable bodies which support these initiatives).
In seminar 3 we will bring together those involved in developing and running community based initiatives such as community shops and Local Economic Trading Systems (LETS), along with those tasked with supporting these initiatives such as The Plunkett Foundation and the Transition Network. The aim is for these initiatives to share experiences and best practice.

Seminar 4 and 5 (third sector organisations, policy makers, media commentators, Think Tanks, housing associations).
In seminars 4 and 5 we will bring together a range of practitioners to evaluate potential policy responses to marketplace exclusion, specifically social housing and community cohesion policies, and develop new insights on these. In seminar 4 we explore the issues arising from multiculturalism and the community cohesion policy response. In seminar 5 we consider affordable housing in England exploring why, and how the mixed communities housing policy has been a failure, the impact on those excluded from the housing market, and whose responsibility it is to foster cohesive communities.

Seminar 6 (young people from the Stoke-on-Trent area, local youth support services, probationary service and youth offending service, Job Centre).
Seminar 6 will be different from previous seminars. We aim to use this seminar as a vehicle to explore the issues arising from the previous 5 seminars. These issues will from the basis of a theatre production with young people in the Stoke-On-Trent area which will explore their experiences of marketplace exclusion 'on the ground'. It will also facilitate knowledge exchange between young people and practitioners though a workshop where key issues arising from the performance will be debated. 

As outlined in the pathways to impact, the above benefits will be delivered through a website and social media strategy. The theatre production and participant workshop will also be central to delivering impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23088</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A draft script of the theatre presentation 'Because You're Worth It?' including some explanations/stage directions.

An Exploration of the Themes Emerging from the ESRC Seminar Series 'Marketplace Exclusion'

The presentation was performed at the New Vic Theatre in Newcastle under Lyme in Staffordshire. It was the final presentation of a series of seminars on the theme of market place exclusion. 

The director Susan Moffat had attended some of the seminar series and presented and run a workshop in one held at Liverpool University. Attending the seminars and subsequent planning meetings generated broad themes which were then used when engaging directly with communities surrounding the theatre. 

Included in the presentation were edited soundbites from interviews that had taken place in streets, shopping centres, market places and with groups who are described as marginalised such as NEETS (young people 16-25 who are not in employment education or training) people living in the YMCA and asylum seekers and refugees. Projection was also used in the presentation, these included publicly available snatches of video taken during the so called 'London Riots' 

In the performance were three songs; 
Leon Rossellson 'We Sell Everything&amp;quot; 
Stick in the Wheel 'Becky n Me'
Tasnim Harrison 'Strange Flower' This song was written for the 'Because You're Worth It?' performance and refers to the brutalising effect of exclusion in the form of the murder of Sophie Lancaster whose death resulted in a campaign led by her mother to recognise that crimes against members of minority/sub-culture groups be recognised as hate crime.

The Cast
The cast for the performance of this piece at the New Vic Theatre on Friday, October 23rd, 2015, included four volunteer actors from members of the local community (including Tasnim Harrison who composed and performed the song 'Strange Flower'); three theatre/community practitioners from New Vic Borderlines (the New Vic Theatres outreach department and community partner for the seminar series) and one professional actor. Present on stage also are the voices of community members who were engaged with as part of the research to develop the piece, through the use of 'voice-overs' during the performance. 

The Audience
The audience was made of academics from the universities involved in the series plus other interested academics form other institutions. Audience members also included local businesses ; the 'Town Centre Manager' for Newcastle under Lyme and ex-ceo of the Chamber of Commerce; members of the public/community who had engaged in interviews and workshops about Market Place exclusion as part of the development of the performance; residents from 'Brighter Futures' a large social housing provider from Stoke on Trent; representatives for Asylum support services and asylum seekers; young people for the YMCA; Foodbank providers/volunteers and user; Food-network organisers and two local training providers ACORN training and PM training

The Setting
The presentation took place in the main auditorium of the New Vic. On the stage were a number of two-dimensional mannequins painted red and blue. There were a number of simple black boxes which could be used in a range of ways (eg as a bed or a barricade or as rostra) Around the edges of the stage were boxes representing high end items from recognised leading brands such as Apple Sony Canon Hewlit Packard; a shopping trolley, and an array of wrapped Christmas presents. At the front of the stage was orange netting which would be used to represent the security blinds on shop fronts. Two styles of masks were also used. In the opening of the performance the same half-mask with a fixed 'salesman grin' was worn by all in the cast except the central character. This was used to represent the 'usual' sales approach which was illustrated in the opening song (We Sell Everything') The other masks we produced by StrangeFace Theatre Company, were used to represent the range of people who were arrested and charged in the aftermath of the London Riots. These mask were accompanied by a held placard on which was written the occupation and age of the accused. These labels were an important way of challenging the notion that the rioters were all young unemployed and anti-social.</gtr:description><gtr:id>17855F26-AD38-43D6-A3DD-C542FA5A7F03</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exploring young people's experiences of marketplace exclusion 'on the ground' has undoubtedly given them a voice and facilitated an alternative mode of expression of their experiences through the theatre workshops and final performance. The performance has also facilitated knowledge

They brought together marketing, organisation studies and consumer research scholars on the one hand, and social policy and community cohesion scholars on the other, to identify the ways in which marketplace mechanisms contribute to exclusion as well as policy and community initiative responses to ameliorate this. Each seminar was designed to foster inter-disciplinary discussion as well as viewpoints from practitioners and policy makers. There were four or five speakers at each seminar, including a mix of academics and practitioners. A final discussion workshop drew on the issues raised at all of the seminars and provided the springboard for developing the theatre performance with the New Vic Borderlines. This key findings from this performance are discussed below; essentially though the key significance of the performance lies in its contributions to our understanding of the methodology of performative knowledge production.

What is marketplace exclusion and why is it important as a concept?

Markets are technologies of exclusion, and one of the primary purposes of marketing is to provide/develop and then justify organisational techniques for separating, differentiating and 'segmenting' social life through various regimes of classification. One of the main achievements of marketing had been the institutionalisation of these exclusions, that is, to present exclusion as progressive and neutral devices rather than political and instrumental ones. This is what we might call 'marketing ideology' at work. The history of marketing is a history of the increasing sophistication of these regimes of exclusion which have been massively enhanced and made more effective through information technologies.
Examples of market exclusion can be identified quite easily when we examine the privatization or 'marketization' of previously public goods. As a simple illustrative example, when sporting events available on public broadcasting networks become franchised to private providers those unwilling or unable to pay market subscriptions are by definition 'excluded'. The same would apply to privatised healthcare, education and so on. This does not mean that all non-market conditions are inclusive (they rarely are) but that by definition market conditions are always and necessarily exclusive. Even 'mass' market goods or near-universal market services are usually subject to further differentiation and forms of exclusion, for example while a significant mass/majority of the population now have relatively 'free' access to credit and debt, the market for these products has become highly differentiated and segmented based on a wide range of criteria from economic factors through to lifestyle choices. An air-ticket is clearly exclusive product because it is a differentiated service (alternative means of travel, different classes of seat/service etc.), but this example shows how the market always facilities endless further exclusions (e.g. baggage preferences, loyalty schemes, paying for bookable seats, priority boarding, on board products, food and drink, booking options, payment choices (e.g. credit card fees), and so on). Markets work by the endless drive for exclusion, and exclusion is value.
What about the relationship between marketplace exclusion and social exclusion more generally? One of the main dichotomies at play between the market and the social is as follows: The progressive potential of the 'social' is that has the aim to be inclusive- to 'bring people in', whether this is to bring them into communities, into education, into the 'mainstream' by working against discrimination and so on. The tragedy of the social is when it fails to do this, and social division, social hierarchies and social (and cultural) discrimination is the result. The progressive potential of the market on the other hand it the complete opposite - its primary purpose (as above) being to differentiate, individualise, segment, and target. The market has been extremely successful at the seemingly endless programme of salami slicing society in order to specialise and position products and services. One of the consequences has been the collapse in any realistic possibility of collective (that is to say 'social' action). But, and here is the paradox - in 'reality' when the market fails it achieves the exact opposite to the equivalent failed social condition. Ill-defined markets, 'generic' products (that is to say undifferentiated ones, think of generic pharmaceuticals for example) are examples of market(ing) failure but are often have very socially progressive consequences. 
Many of the cases presented in this ESRC series exemplify this dialectical process very well: the attack on social housing, alternative currency schemes, responses to austerity, local food co-operatives and distribution initiatives - they are all implicated with market 'failures' or the breakdown of the market exclusion mechanism. In short, when the market fails the potential of the social can often prosper, and vice versa. (The less progressive examples of this serve equally to illustrate the point: look at how the losses of the financial crisis were 'socialised' for example).

How are consumers excluded from the market?

Traditional Marketing: Segment - Target - Position

The starting point of any market is the idea that there are consumers with needs on the one hand and agents (let's call them firms/sellers) with some capacity to satisfy those needs on the other. A loaf of bread satisfies hunger, a car the need for status and transportation, a West End Musical the desire (which is just another kind of 'modern' need) for entertainment and pleasure. The question marketing and economics is not able to adequately address is why are people's needs so different to one another? Why do we not all, broadly speaking 'need' the same amount and kinds of things? Instead marketing assumes that needs are disparate, varied and dispersed without ever seriously asking the question why this is the case: For the market to operate we must accept the premise that one person 'needs' one thing while another needs something else. Of course it is more subtle that this, in that in 'reality' we all rank our needs differently so that while we might all need similar things we express a preference for some things more than others. One person might place the need for bread above the need for beer, while another may make the opposite choice. The point is that we each operate an a self-directed economic agent who has to make choices based on the reality of scarcity that we face. This choice is the basis for all our 'voluntary exclusion'. We are, we might say 'exclusive' agents in that we express a desire for A and not B. I will pay for pay TV where as you will not. I would prefer to spend my money on private health care so that I can jump the queue for a medical treatment whereas you would prefer wait on the list and watch TV? We also have different means to satisfy our needs, which in a market generally boils down to how much economic wealth we have at our disposal whether in terms of capital, money or debt. The art of the marketer, and the point of strategy is to 'target' or discriminate between people (or aggregated groups/segments to be more precise) on the basis on their supposed, expressed or manifest needs as well as their ability to access and utilise different means (money). 

Networked Markets

Increasingly markets are complex systems in which multiple actors congeal around a single transaction - facilitating, slicing, and chopping it up. These are many-to-many connections: networked markets. An example should serve to illustrate the difference: Making a purchase on Amazon is qualitatively different from purchasing something at a local market. I search for an item, reading reviews from other users and fabricated ones by firms, all the time the website monitors my clicks and makes suggestions to me about what else I might like based on what I'm doing. It drops a &amp;quot;cookie&amp;quot; onto my device which marks me as I look at other pages and websites. It also analyses the other cookies I've acquired from other sites and &amp;quot;remarkets&amp;quot; me adverts for things I've already looked at. When I find something I want, it might involve buying a product from an external seller - not even Amazon. But I use Amazon to make the purchase. It has all my delivery details and credit cards info - I have delegated much of my memory to Amazon. I then pay through Paypal. They also have all my details. So I am sent to their systems and enter their databases. Once I click my way through, I go back to Amazon. The seller is then informed by Amazon that I've bought their item and by Paypal that I've paid. They are told where to send the goods. They then go to a shipping company and pay them to ship it to me - or for me, given I've paid for the delivery. The seller and I thus enter more databases. Afterwards, I am asked to rate the seller and the item I bought - creating yet more data.
Welcome to a networked market. It is a marketplace with a networked form that is made possible by various networks - notably the internet. These networks structure markets in subtle, important and unseen ways - changing our behaviour and our thought processes. From GPS satellites to websites, NOSQL databases to wifi connections, social media apps to algorithmic buildings, microphones to headphones, search engines to bitcoins, each technology can speak to the other because they all work with structured data. This, in turn, requires us consumers to increasingly communicate through structured data (and increasingly to act on the basis of structured data). Whether we know it or not we increasing speak to machines like a machine. We rarely see the structures but isn't it weird that you cannot rate an Ebayer seller at 6 stars; that Amazon never says 'People like you also bought nothing else'; that Facebook asks what you like not what you love or hate? 
What does it mean to be excluded from networked markets? Most obviously there is the question of access. At our Nottingham workshop, we looked at the issue of 'digital exclusion'. It is estimated that nearly 7 million Britons do not have access to the internet - typically coming from lower socio-economic groupings. These people may find themselves increasingly left out of the networked economy. Beyond this, there is the question of access to capacity. As 3G gives way to 4G and 5G, those with the deepest pockets can buy access to the quickest markets. But then there is the issue of access based on who you are and what you do - or more accurately what networks know about you and what do you know about them


Developing the methodology of performative knowledge production to work with marginal populations

Our documentary drama which formed the basis of the final seminar was based on themes emerging from the previous five seminars. These themes were explored via semi-structured interviews in streets, shopping centres, market places and with groups who are described as marginalised such as NEETS (young people 16-25 who are not in employment education or training) people living in the YMCA and asylum seekers and refugees. These interviews were also used to recruit participants for the theatre workshops and presentation.
Five weekly theatre workshops were based on the above oral testimonies drawing out themes for elaboration. Participants listened to the voices recorded and selected narratives to be developed into a presentation. Workshops used the principles of cultural animation to encourage participation on equal terms and stimulate thinking and acting outside the box. The weekly workshops were followed by a five day theatre residency to bring the work together and devise and rehearse the performance.
The cast included four volunteer actors from members of the local community; three theatre/community practitioners from New Vic Borderlines and one professional actor. Present on stage also were the voices of community members who were engaged with as part of the research to develop the piece, through the use of 'voice-overs' during the performance. 

The performance relied on multi-media material (recorded voices, music, poems, costumes, lighting and movement) to create a kaleidoscope of perspectives which ultimately facilitated the emergence of a communal multi-voice about marketplace exclusion. Designed to be challenging and thought provoking, projection was also used in the presentation, these included publicly available snatches of video taken during the so called 'London Riots'. Included in the presentation were also edited soundbites - 'voice-overs' from the earlier interviews. The communal nature of the subject on stage was also realised through the style of acting, with performers shifting from role to role to show what has happened rather than becoming the character to whom it has happened (Comb, 2003). 
The audience was made up of academics from the universities involved in the series plus other interested academics form other institutions. Audience members also included local businesses ; the 'Town Centre Manager' for Newcastle under Lyme and ex-CEO of the Chamber of Commerce; members of the public/community who had engaged in interviews and workshops about Market Place exclusion as part of the development of the performance; residents from 'Brighter Futures' a large social housing provider from Stoke on Trent; representatives for Asylum support services and asylum seekers; young people from the YMCA; Foodbank providers/volunteers and user; Food-network organisers and two local training providers ACORN training and PM training.

The presentation was followed by an interactive debate on the themes arising, with delegates working with the participants who performed the presentation to create an outcome which moves toward inclusivity through identifying factors which cause segregation, barriers to cohesion, and present an 'ideal' of what an inclusive market place might look, sound and feel like.
This performative mode of knowledge production represents a democratic way of sharing different understandings and experiences that can generate knowledge about different types of exclusions. The performance showed that consumption and the marketplace are intrinsic elements of poverty, deprivation and exclusion. Social change is therefore not just about the obvious social indicators of inequality, or the particular urban contexts of cities such as London and Stoke, but also about the market and different forms of consumption. Markets and the processes within them are not neutral. But the performance also revealed the ability of the apparently disenfranchised to have a powerful voice, to form their own analysis and commentary on social inequality and the market. Within the safe space of the theatre marginalised individuals regained their individual agency, and the bringing together of actors and spect-actors also created a communal agency that transcended the individual. Future studies may need to focus on how to harness agency and turn it into action that can tackle marketplace and social exclusion in deprived local communities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As discussed above our key findings lie in two distinct areas. Firstly in creating a better understanding of the mechanisms through which the marketplace perpetuates exclusion and second in using and developing the methodology of performative knowledge production to engage with excluded consumers and create a better understanding of the issues on the ground. We would imagine that a better understanding of market mechanisms would feed into more creative responses to policy development that rather than relying on individual incentive target the structural issues at stake. We would hope that our methodology would be put to good use and developed in both policy and academic circles to research the views and experiences of marginalised groups but further to create a more level playing field in the co-production of knowledge.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>25969161-3876-4ECD-B223-A235114EC25E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/management/conferences-and-events/esrc/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Professor H Beider, invited as expert witness to House of Commons select committee Women and Equalities to discuss work on white working class communities</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0DA4A3C6-EF0E-430F-BE0C-00729228F6EC</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This research method involves the use of a documentary drama as the basis for further knowledge production. the documentary drama is based on interviews with excluded groups.

This is a powerful methodology for co-designing and co-producing knowledge with local communities. It also Engages excluded groups by giving them a voice and a role in rethinking policy responses.
