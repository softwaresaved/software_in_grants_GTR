The research we propose will lead to a simple and efficient way of making some classes of molecule currently considered difficult or even impossible to obtain, a limitation which means that some groups of potential targets are currently unavailable. It seeks to develop a transformation in which an aromatic ring becomes bonded to a lithium-bearing carbon atom in such a way that the shape of the starting material is remembered in the product. The products have the common feature of a highly hindered carbon atom carrying an O, N or S substituent - a feature difficult to construct by existing methods. The proposed reactions proceed by a remarkable mechanism, and by joint investigation involving both synthetic organic and structural inorganic chemists we propose to understand why the reaction works the way it does and to use this understanding to develop further related transformations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>137670</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Prof. Ian Hillier</gtr:description><gtr:id>3D798627-04C5-4006-B5C4-536004DEBDE5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>5 Research papers of which 1 is not directly linked to this grant:

To do this in situ infrared spectroscopy was used successfully in tandem with NMR spectroscopy and theoretical methods to gain new insights into how the reaction proceeds in real time. It was possible to show how certain deprotonated ureas underwent N-to-C aryl transfer with retention of configuration to synthesise a stereochemically controlled quaternary carbon centre. Calculations elucidated how the process is controlled by the presence of metal counterions and how changes to the coordination sphere of these influences their migration during the rearrangement process. We showed how coordination of the metal is central to enforcing retentive attack on the deprotonated centre and that the formation of a very short-lived dearomatized intermediate was essential to completing the rearrangement. Work was published in Eur. J. Org. Chem., 2012, 731-743.

We achieved new reaction intermediates using our understanding of ligand effects in deprotonation chemistry and, in particular, the directed benzylic deprotonation of aromatic systems. Of major interest is the discovery that directed benzylic deprotonation can generate tertiary carbanions as a means of elaborating aromatic systems. This was long held to be unachievable and its development will have significant implications for chemists in academia and industry. We rationalised electronic effects on the reaction, correlating structure-reactivity influence with the action of chemical additives and so achieved a high level of control over reaction selectivity and efficiency. In scenarios where benzylic and ortho deprotonation are in competition we can now favour one or other reaction. Hence, arylamides have been derivatized in both ortho deprotonated and benzylically deprotonated forms. To do this it was necessary to understand electronic and steric effects and the interrelationship between the two. Using a single donor atom (monodentate) solvent a new type of reaction intermediate was observed for the orthometallation process, revealing important information about how steric effects influence the internal molecular geometry of the system, with the amide directing group acting intramolecularly (seen before) but also intermolecularly (hitherto unknown) when controlling the site of reaction. By manipulating solvent conditions we made the same reagent undergo a reaction that was previously not thought possible. By introducing tridentate additives the site of deprotonation could be migrated to the benzylic position in spite of the fact that this necessitated the formation of a sterically congested carbanion. Subsequently, electronic effects that control this selectivity have been elucidated using theoretical techniques. This let us develop various additives (including bidentate and chiral additives) to achieve the same selectivity in more applicable systems. Synthetic chemistry applications of this new reaction were developed. This work was published in Chem. Eur. J., 2011, 17, 8078-8084 and 2012, 18, 11036-11045 and Beilstein J. Org. Chem., 2012, 8, 50-60 (Open Access).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The pharmaceutical industry constantly requires new and more efficient reactions capable of easily and cheaply generating chiral quaternary carbon centres adjacent to heteroatoms (eg. N, O) and the ability to do this by rearranging deprotonated ureas will hold a strong appeal. At present, such quaternary carbons are typically difficult to generate, with nucleophilic attack on ketones or imines struggling when substituents flanking the functional groups are electronically/sterically similar. Alternative routes based on carbamate reagents have hitherto employed multistep processes or else extra steps based on boron chemistry have been required in an attempt to enhance substrate generality. In contrast, the present work reveals a one-pot rearrangement that is strongly economically compelling.

The benzylic deprotonation of aromatic systems by directed metallation is well documented to be of great importance in the synthesis of primary and secondary carbanions. These reactions already find manifold applications in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. However, the inability of this chemistry to yield tertiary carbanions has hitherto proved a significant limitation. The newly-proven ability to be able to make tertiary benzylic carbanions by directed lithiation is therefore likely to appeal to a wide variety of chemists and is highly likely to find applications in similar commercial lines of fine chemical synthesis. The understanding imparted by the present work in terms of controlling kinetic vs. thermodynamic reaction selectivity also suggests new avenues applicable to fine chemical providers, as does the successful employment of chiral auxiliaries.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ABED1DCA-05A2-411F-9600-2220093C96FA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/97F48320-4326-448C-BFC3-2B7CDF901E76"><gtr:id>97F48320-4326-448C-BFC3-2B7CDF901E76</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ligand effects in the formation of tertiary carbanions from substituted tertiary aromatic amides.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/caff8b2906fca05a928c341c8cf9e748"><gtr:id>caff8b2906fca05a928c341c8cf9e748</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith AC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0947-6539</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4B83E47A-1AB8-4EA0-8A52-B1F2DA776899"><gtr:id>4B83E47A-1AB8-4EA0-8A52-B1F2DA776899</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Mechanism of the Stereospecific Intramolecular Arylation of Lithiated Ureas: The Role of Li+ Probed by Electronic Structure Calculations, and by NMR and IR Spectroscopy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Organic Chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/153bb8407de7254b9c5006563eb4843f"><gtr:id>153bb8407de7254b9c5006563eb4843f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Grainger D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/905DC420-1DD7-4681-A77B-00A3EA375C84"><gtr:id>905DC420-1DD7-4681-A77B-00A3EA375C84</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lithiated tertiary carbanions display variable coordination modes: evidence from DFT and NMR studies.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/08b6e85308d0f88024074521c0b75959"><gtr:id>08b6e85308d0f88024074521c0b75959</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vincent MA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0947-6539</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1C4294A7-C1E8-4052-AE6E-EE024FD3B34F"><gtr:id>1C4294A7-C1E8-4052-AE6E-EE024FD3B34F</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the control of secondary carbanion structure utilising ligand effects during directed metallation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Beilstein journal of organic chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/38c21ce8fa79eae58ff79ac07483bd52"><gtr:id>38c21ce8fa79eae58ff79ac07483bd52</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wheatley AE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1860-5397</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B1503B07-3BDB-418B-84A5-24BF92659107"><gtr:id>B1503B07-3BDB-418B-84A5-24BF92659107</gtr:id><gtr:title>Controlling the regioselectivity of directed aromatic metallation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/de4cbe761ba1393e4d41a1c411418435"><gtr:id>de4cbe761ba1393e4d41a1c411418435</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Alison Campbell Smith (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G000816/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>41B6965D-D659-4099-9434-7C61B7E5BEF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asymmetric Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B9701E7-D17F-4963-82DA-B3926A65B50A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological &amp; Medicinal Chem.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
