In addition to the physical processes driving plate tectonics, climate and ocean-atmospheric exchange, it supports an extraordinary diversity of living organisms, from microbes to mammals and everything in between. Such wasn't always the case, however, and it is clear that both the planet and its biosphere have evolved - indeed, co-evolved - over deep time. In the past two billion years, by far the most fundamental shift in this co-evolutionary process occurred during the Neoproterozoic (1000 to 542 million years ago), a planetary revolution that culminated in the modern Earth system. The Neoproterozoic begins with a biosphere populated almost exclusively by microbes, and ends in the midst of its greatest ever evolutionary radiation - including the diverse macroscopic and biomineralizing organisms that define the modern biosphere. At the same time, it witnessed the greatest climatic and biogeochemical perturbations that the planet has ever experienced, alongside major palaeogeographic reconfigurations and a deep ocean that is becoming oxygenated for the first time. There is no question that these phenomena are broadly interlinked, but the tangle of causes, consequences and co-evolutionary feedbacks has yet to be convincingly teased apart. In order to reconstruct the Neoproterozoic revolution, we propose a multidisciplinary programme of research that will capture its evolving geochemical and biological signatures in unprecedented detail. Most significantly, these collated data will be assessed and modeled in the context of a co-evolving Earth system, whereby developments in one compartment potentially facilitate and escalate those in another, sometimes to the extent of deriving entirely novel phenomena and co-evolutionary opportunities. Our approach will be guided by three general hypotheses, testable against accruing data and theory: H1) that the enhanced weathering associated with land-dwelling eukaryotes was initiated in the early Neoproterozoic leading to major environmental change, including extreme glaciations and stepwise increase(s) in atmospheric oxygen concentration; H2) that major environmental changes in the mid Neoproterozoic triggered the emergence of animals; and H3) that the late Neoproterozoic-Cambrian radiations of animals and biomineralization were themselves responsible for much of the accompanying biogeochemical perturbation. Primary data for this project will be assembled from field studies of key geological sections in the UK and North China, along with contributed sample sets from Namibia, Spitsbergen and various archived collections. Together, these offer close to comprehensive coverage of the Neoproterozoic - not least, spectacular new surfaces of Ediacaran macrofossils from Charnwood Forest. Collected samples will be analysed to assess associated weathering and climate (Sr, C, O and S isotopes), oceanic redox conditions (Fe speciation and trace metals), nutrient dynamics (P speciation and trace metals) and biological constituents (microfossils, macrofossils and biomarker molecules). These data will be integrated and interrogated through the development of heuristic, spatial and evolutionary models. Beyond its integrative approach, the strength of this proposal lies in the diversity of the contributing researchers. Alongside our own expertise in biogeochemistry, palaeobiology and Earth system modelling, we are very pleased to have attracted world-class project partners in Neoproterozoic stratigraphy, geochronology and biomarker analysis. Further insight will come from our contingent of two PDRAs and three PhD students working across the range of topics and linked via a schedule of regular team meetings. Taken together, we anticipate a fundamentally improved understanding of the Neoproterozoic Earth system and the co-evolutionary interplay between the biosphere and planet.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34319</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We manufactured large display replicas of the fossil sea bed surfaces in Charnwood Forest for permanent display in The Royal Ontario Museum (Canada), Leicester New Walk Museum and The Lapworth Museum (Birmingham University); temporary displays were provided to Birmingham City Library and The Sedgewick Museum (Cambridge University).

The research has also started to be used to help protect the internationally important fossil sites from degradation, for example by better understanding the chemistry of the rocks and their potential susceptibility to any intervention (e.g. covering with a structure, or soil etc); this will help Natural England determine the best approach to their future protection. In the process of undertaking the research I also gained greater understanding of the geology of Charnwood; this is of considerable interest to the quarry operators (which are major suppliers of aggregrate to London) and BGS has won a contract to inform their activities. Subsequent work might include advising the quarry operators on which areas might require special consideration during the restoration of the land.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0B2D369E-07FB-4A2D-822C-A1E38B3BE454</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Ediacaran Period saw the emergence of the first large complex marine organisms. Previously considered to have been biologically simple, my research suggests that they were more complex and perhaps contained differentiated tissues. Furthermore, their communities were more complex than envisioned, being influenced by disturbance and their neighbours. Their population structures provide clues as to their reproduction, growth, dispersal and sensitivity to environmental conditions. My research has provided a more nuanced view of Earth's earliest communities, how they compare with subsequent animal-dominated ones, and what effect large body size had on the coevolution of Earth and life. In addition, my research provided clues to how these entirely soft-bodied organisms became preserved.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The enhanced understanding of the preservation of the Ediacaran organisms will help other researchers recognise the degree to which the fossil communities are biased, thereby allowing more accurate assessments of their structure and ecology. The results of the zircon dating programme will contribute to a developing chronostratigraphic framework which will form the basis of international correlation and provide context to evolutionary analyses. Greater understanding of the geology of Charnwood Forest will benefit the active quarrying companies and the protection of the
