Despite this, there is no consensus amongst policy makers or criminological scholars about the most appropriate responses. In England, where this study is located, youth justice policies have been in a more or less constant state of change for two decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although youth justice practitioners must learn to make professional judgements in an environment of rapidly changing policy, surprisingly little is known about how they interpret and implement policy. Even less is known about the extent to which the training and education they receive prior to becoming youth justice workers prepares them to manage their everyday working lives.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research project aims to plug this gap in knowledge by conducting research with two youth offending services in England. Approximately one hundred qualitative, in-depth interviews will be conducted with the full range of youth justice workers in the studied locations, excluding administrative and sessional workers and volunteers.This will include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>operational managers&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>youth justice practitioners&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>senior regional and national governmental and YJB personnel&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>senior local authority personnel&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>other key partners.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In line with the research aims/objectives and the impact objectives outlined in 'Pathways to Impact', the key non-academic constituencies that will benefit from this research project will be: a) those tasked with delivering youth justice policy and practice reform; and b) those involved with youth justice professional education and training. Key to securing impact with both constituencies is presenting the research at the Annual Youth Justice Convention held by the Youth Justice Board and the National Association for Youth Justice Annual Conference (if reconvened), in addition to the range of dissemination activities described below and in 'Pathways to Impact'.

Youth Justice Policy and Practice Reform: 
 
Key stakeholders include: local youth justice service practitioners, their managers; local authority partners; and the Youth Justice Board (or Ministry of Justice if the YJB is disbanded). 
 
Key stakeholders will be engaged through: the project website; consultation workshops with practitioner participants (during the research); 4 page research briefing (hard copies sent to all youth justice services, as well as research participants and key centres of criminological research); short 'research in practice' briefings aimed at practitioners (made available through the website and email lists); publications in practitioner-facing journals and an end-of-project conference targeted at practitioners, policy makers and academics. In the process of dissemination, the practical implications for the practitioner will be made clear.
 
Local youth justice service professionals and local authorities will also be provided with regular updates via the project website, which will be used as a portal through which visitors can access all of the project publications. Other forms of electronic engagement with non-academic research users will include regular mailing to the Youth Justice / Youth Criminology Specialist Research Network and via its jiscmail distribution list (Dr Phoenix is a steering committee member and co-owner of the jiscmail list). Dr Phoenix will explore the possibility of engaging the Youth Justice Board in the research at an early stage in her capacity as an academic member of their consultation group reviewing the practice of risk assessment and its implications. 
 
Youth Justice Education and Training: 
 
Key stakeholders include: organisations responsible for approving and managing professional education and training (i.e. the YJB, ECORYS and the Open University); and educational organisations responsible for delivering, more broadly, education for youth justice practitioners (including academic departments offering professional education for social workers, probation officers, youth and community workers and vocationally facing criminology and youth justice UG, PGT and Professional Doctorates). 
 
The strategy that will be adopted to ensure impact with this constituency of non-academic research users will 'piggy-back' the pathways to impact outlined above, alongside a publication strategy that specifically targets key journals focusing on (i) professional education in children's services and in community justice; (ii) youth justice practice across the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 

More directly, Dr Phoenix has already begun the process of engaging with the YJB, and is in consultation with Ruth Searle, Senior Strategy Advisor, about possible changes to workforce development. The key success indicator of engaging this constituency (both YJB and higher education institutions) will be to chart the adoption and 'career' of the concept of a research-led youth justice pedagogy. The outcome of engagement with non-academic beneficiaries, in this case, will be the construction of a set of implementable recommendations for reforming the content, curricula, or design of professional training. In relation to youth justice, this part of the research project is breaking entirely new ground.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>310425</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Please see submission for ES/J009857/2.
