People's behaviour can cause energy use to be 30-40% higher than Building experts anticipate. Generally, people are keen on saving energy for financial as well as environmental motives. However, uncertainty remains about the exact benefits of installing energy-efficiency measures and changing household habits. Despite a long tradition of energy advice, energy efficiency measures remain pallid and unconvincing, removed from people's day-to-day experiences. There is a gap between abstract, invisible energy flows and people's desire to understand their energy use and become more energy efficient. We offer a solution that bridges this gap.

Our previous work has shown that visualising energy loss by means of thermal images led householders to install more energy-efficiency measures and reduced their energy bills when audited a year later, compared to a conventional energy audit (Goodhew et al., 2012). Building on this, the present research will take a major step forward by using novel digital data visualisation techniques to present intuitive, easily graspable representations of energy flows. Using our virtual reality and data visualisation expertise, we will produce sophisticated interactive 3D and 4D representations of energy flows. We will add and overlay scientific projections of future states to direct observations and employ a range of approaches including webcams, simulation, smartphones, and social media such as facebook. 

Energy flows will be visualised as a function of house type (e.g., detached), any retrofits undertaken (e.g., loft insulation) and occupant behaviour (e.g., opening windows). Visualisations will be developed with users to evaluate their intuitiveness and motivational properties. We will include interactive tailored visualisations as well as generic &amp;quot;walk-throughs&amp;quot; for domestic and public buildings. The Energy Saving Trust and other partners have agreed to disseminate visualisations through their web-site and dedicated events. The best visualisations will be used in field trials with our UK and International partners to evaluate financial and carbon savings over time. Social media (e.g., facebook) will be exploited to engage a wider range of people with this information. We will evaluate which types of visualisations and data people are willing to share (and which attract most attention and debate in their social network) and examine how people use these to discuss and reduce energy use.

Our research programme will increase understanding of energy dynamics as a function of occupant behaviour and building characteristics. It will allow experts to make better predictions of energy efficiency and design buildings around human behaviour, and it will help occupants to change their habitual behaviour (e.g., open windows) to reduce energy use as well as motivate them to take up offers of energy-efficiency measures (e.g., loft insulation). All of these together will contribute to energy demand reduction and help people take charge of their energy use to future-proof their buildings in the face of rising energy cost and climate change.

UK newspaper headlines report two issues just as we are finalising the eViz research progamme. First, the UK's carbon emissions have increased for the first time since 2007, one reason being increased home heating in the winter of 2010 (Guardian, 8th February 2011). Second, average household energy bills have doubled in the past six years and are expected to rise by up to 60% more by 2020 (Independent, 10th February 2011). The present research is dedicated to helping people stay warm in the context of attaining the UK's carbon reduction targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>188499</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research and development contribution to this collaborative project the eViz Project has focused on the development of an interactive virtual apartment, exploiting a range of user interface styles, 3D models, physics and particle-based effects from the gaming community. The aim of this research is twofold: firstly to provide a toolkit enabling investigators to design a variety of techniques for visualising energy sources and flows within a typical domestic dwelling; and secondly to provide an experimental test bed supporting the rapid execution of usability and behavioural &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot; experiments. Early experiments have shown very strong engagement on the part of end users with this type of data visualisation technique (effectively making the &amp;quot;invisible visible&amp;quot;) and the results have suggested a number of key usability modifications which are, at the time of this submiission being completed, prior to undertaking a new set of experimental studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are demonstrating the eViz &amp;quot;Virtual Apartment&amp;quot; to a wide range of potential adopters, including those in the nuclear industry, where there is significant interest in visualising invisible processes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>04881E02-CBE6-4C22-AF71-E6953A819291</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The virtual apartment, developed using the Unity game development toolkit, interfaces with external datasets (appliance, lighting and heating usage). Ultimately the user must find the optimised energy usage for a particular scenario (e.g. day, night, winter, summer). The user has the ability to interact with doors, windows, appliances, lights and the boiler thermostat. They also have the ability to &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; further upgrades to the home that will increase energy saving, such as double glazing, or wall, floor and roof insulation. Whilst understanding the amount of current energy use is important, the virtual apartment also helps explain to the user why there is energy loss by incorporating a virtual thermal camera and visualisations of heat and airflow based on computational fluid dynamics. The user can switch to a virtual thermal imaging mode designed specifically to give a thermal colour gradient representation of the apartment. In addition to interacting with the virtual apartment using a PC or laptop equipped with an appropriate graphics card, users can also experience the environment in a &amp;quot;immersive&amp;quot; style of engagement, as the software has been modified further to allow hosting (stereoscopically) on a SmartPhone (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Note 4, S6) using a Samsung GearVR head-mounted display and interactive controller.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D8390CCC-DE45-48C8-8BB6-0EE316546917</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The concept demonstrator was presented as part of the 2014 BEHAVE conference in Oxford and formed a central part of end user evaluation trials being conducted in collaboration with University of Plymouth collaborators. The demonstrator has undergone a recent (November, 2014, Summer 2015) modification based on early user trials and a second, more game-like inplementation has been developed. The desktop and immersive versions of the eViz apartment were also demonstrated to representatives of SSE plc (formerly Scottish and Southern Energy plc) at a special workshop hosted by the Edne Project in the Summer of 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Virtual Apartment Energy Visualisation Concept Demonstrator</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0744A79A-0579-43E4-8DEA-E5BCC8FE7BB4"><gtr:id>0744A79A-0579-43E4-8DEA-E5BCC8FE7BB4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Applying Artificial Neural Networks to Promote Behaviour Change for Saving Residential Energy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Artificial Neural Networks and Intelligent Information Processing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/40d38b88f6b80db752055c7df0123631"><gtr:id>40d38b88f6b80db752055c7df0123631</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rafiq, R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/99E601A6-105A-4B36-B8CA-3F3B1A45A6CB"><gtr:id>99E601A6-105A-4B36-B8CA-3F3B1A45A6CB</gtr:id><gtr:title>EXPLOITING GAMING TECHNOLOGIES TO VISUALISE DYNAMIC THERMAL QUALITIES OF A DOMESTIC DWELLING: PILOT STUDY OF AN INTERACTIVE VIRTUAL APARTMENT</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BEHAVE (Behaviour &amp; Energy Efficiency) 2104</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/aa7cf5c4a09ec32266d2a4e9d320814e"><gtr:id>aa7cf5c4a09ec32266d2a4e9d320814e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stone, R.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K002295/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
