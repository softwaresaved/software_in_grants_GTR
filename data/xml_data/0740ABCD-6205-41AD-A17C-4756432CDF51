Russia is a paradigm case: by far the world?s largest country, a nuclear power and UN Security Council permanent member, and one of the world?s most important energy suppliers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Taking the elections of 2011-2012 as a case study, the project will provide the closest possible analysis of the entire process using qualitative as well as quantitative techniques. A large part of the funding will be devoted to two national representative surveys, to be conducted immediately following each election. In addition, there will be a series of focus groups designed to provide a perspective ?from below?, framed in the words of the actors themselves and complementary to the aggregate evidence that is available through the surveys. Full use will in addition be made of printed and electronic sources (including those of the Central Electoral Commission itself), and of field visits.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal will seek to make an impact not only through the applicant himself but also through the colleagues who have agreed to take part in a number of its individual elements, including Professor McAllister at the ANU and Dr Kryshtanovskaya in Moscow. 

The Department's own Guidelines for Ethical Conduct in Research emphasise that 'Where possible, researchers should feed back the findings and outcomes of their research to the individuals, communities and countries studied', and engage so far as possible with local researchers on a 'mutually respectful and truly reciprocal' basis. We take a particular interest in the communication of our findings within the region itself and their discussion among colleagues at policy-related institutes such as the Carnegie Moscow Center and the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, with which the Department of Politics at Glasgow has a long-standing protocol of cooperation. 

This formal collaboration agreement, signed in 1990, commits both sides to 'the mutual exchange of literature', the 'preparation of joint publications on the results of research', 'assistance in the publication of the work of [Russian] author-participants in British publications, and of British authors in [Russian] ones'; the 'exchange of data bases'; the 'organisation of annual seminars for the discussion of the progress of work and the exchange of results'; and on the British side, the obligation to 'seek sponsors in order to enlarge business contacts and the opportunities for cooperation'. 

A role of particular importance in this respect will be played by Dr Kryshtanovskaya through her regular briefing of the Moscow-based diplomatic service, including officials in the UK Embassy (where her contacts have included Jonathan Aves, Nigel Gould-Davies and Kate Horner) as well as relevant officials in many other embassies: those of the US, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain and Switzerland. She works also as a consultant for 'Business Russia' (Delovaya Rossiya), an association of Russian small businesses, and offers regular commentaries to the UK and international media, including German, Dutch, Danish, French and Finnish television. She also makes regular contributions to the international printed media, including those of US origin (the New York Times and Wall Street Journal), the Canadian Christian Science Monitor, the German Die Welt, the Austrian Standart, the Japanese Mainiti and Senkei Shimbum among others.

She also carries out work for other organisations including Freedom House of New York and has taken a regular part in conferences in the UK, including ones that are intended primarily for practitioners such as those organised by Chatham House and Wilton Park. She will be attending the 2011 annual conference of BASEES at Cambridge, where she will speak on 'The tandem - where next?' 

We attach still greater importance to beneficiaries in the public sphere in the UK, particularly central government (the foreign and diplomatic service) and the national and international media (the applicant is a frequent contributor to radio and newspapers in the UK and abroad, including in recent years the Russian and Canadian daily press, and the Irish, Ulster, Scottish, South African and Austrian radio). The public sphere also includes higher, secondary and community education. The applicant has very large university classes in Russian politics (some 500 for first-year lectures alone), and expects in the coming years to teach courses on contemporary Russian politics at honours level as well as related courses at MSc level, and to engage in PhD supervision (he has so far supervised more than thirty doctorates to completion). 

The applicant has also for some time taken a regular part in 'outreach' programmes of various kinds, including lecturing in schools and colleges to teachers and students of modern studies and contributing to their publications.l</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80109</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project's scholarly impact was communicated to a large extent through seminar and conference presentations. The PI spoke for instance at the American Slavic studies conferences in 2012 and 2013, at the annual BASEES conference in 2012 and 2013, and (with Professor McAllister) at the PSA conference in 2012 on 'Were Russia's 2011-12 elections &amp;quot;free and fair&amp;quot;? (And does it matter?)'. Professor McAllister presented a paper with the PI at a conference on 'Electoral integrity and support for democracy in postcommunist Europe' at the Australian National University in 2012. The PI also acted as discussant at a panel on electoral observation missions at the ECPR in 2013, and presented papers to the Politics Departments at Newcastle and Essex universities and to a 'mid-election roundtable' at Edinburgh University in 2012. 

The scholarly impact of the project was extended more widely through a (still continuing) series of publications, including the papers in the Journal of Elections, Parties and Public Opinion and Politics; two contributions to the Russian Analytical Digest in March 2012 on the Russian elections; and a contribution on 'public opinion and voting behaviour' to the Routledge Handbook of Russian Politics and Society (2012). Two much more substantial publications are in progress: a study of Russia and authoritarian elections in which Cambridge have expressed an interest, and a major study (also with Ian McAllister) of The Russian Voter. 

Economic and societal impacts included for instance contributions to pedagogy in UK and international higher education, particularly a chapter on 'The electoral process' in Developments in Russian Politics 8 (Palgrave and Duke, just published) that drew on project findings, and talks to student Politics societies. They also included contributions to the UK and international media, including two BBC radio interviews directly from Moscow; and presentations to practitioners, including the EU External Action Service in Brussels and Australian intelligence officials at Canberra, both in 2012. 

The PI made a series of other contributions to public audiences, including chairing and contributing to a panel on 'UK-Russian relations today' at the Festival of Politics at the Scottish Parliament; speaking to the GB-Russia Association (an audience that included many practitioners) at Pushkin House in London; and addressing a very large audience at Keele World Affairs, all in 2012.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F753CF50-FAAC-433D-97A3-C47250DED3EC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has led to a series of findings, most of which drew on collaboration with the PI?s Russian and Australian colleagues whose further development was itself one of the project?s explicit objectives. 
1. In the first instance, the project has generated a series of findings relating to the ?fairness? of both the December 2011 and March 2012 presidential elections. The fact that the PI and colleagues have been engaged in this work for twenty years or more across the entire postcommunist region allowed these findings to be set in a wider crossnational and over-time perspective. Our results show a steady increase, especially marked in 2011, in the proportion who regarded the elections as ?unfair? (25 per cent in 2007, but 39 per cent in 2011). A separate multivariate analysis established that (for instance) a belief that the elections had been fair was little associated with gender, age, education or residential location, but much more closely with self-reported income (those who thought they had a ?good? income were much more likely to believe the elections had been fair than those who thought they had a ?poor? income). 
2. A second body of findings related beliefs about electoral integrity (a measure that combined the counting of the vote, access to the media and the conduct of the local campaign) to democratic values. The analysis extended across Belarus and Ukraine as well as Russia, controlling for independent variables such as beliefs about corruption among public officials, support for the current regime and television consumption. There were powerful effects for incumbency (government supporters were more likely to see the election as fair, net of other circumstances), and for perceptions of corruption among state officials (which had the opposite effect); electoral integrity itself was a significant predictor of satisfaction with democracy in all three countries. A full version of these findings is available in McAllister and White, Journal of Elections, Parties and Public Opinion (in press).
3. A third set of findings related to the perception that the Duma election of 2011 had been potentially a ?Twitter revolution?, based on the increasing use that Russians have been making of new social media and the precedent of the ?Arab Spring?. Our findings confirm that the media did indeed play a major role in shaping the public?s views about the fairness of the election, but in unexpected ways. Net of other circumstances, the greater the frequency of watching television, the more likely the person was to view the elections as having been fairly conducted; by contrast, more frequent use of the internet was associated with seeing the election as unfair. Social networking, in turn, had a major impact on beliefs about the demonstrations, but only Facebook; its effect was statistically significant at the .01 level and was the second largest in the entire model after beliefs about the fairness of the election itself. A full version of these findings is available in another paper, White and McAllister, ?Did Russia (Nearly) have a Facebook Revolution in 2011??, Politics, February 2014.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project will find its most natural extension in the book-length studies that have been mentioned in the previous section, and in the active discussion that is currently developing around ?authoritarian elections?. The PI will be contributing in this connection to the BASEES conference and to a panel on electoral integrity at the Political Studies Association in April 2014, to the British International Studies Association in Dublin in June, to the European Consortium for Political Research in September and to the American Slavists in November. The PI expects to contribute at the same time to scholarly discussion in Russia itself, in journals such as the Higher School of Economics? Mir Rossii, of whose editorial board he has recently become a member. The PI and his long-standing collaborators are in an exceptionally strong position to contribute to these ongoing discussions on the basis of the substantial body of research resources that they have accumulated through this and previous projects, including focus groups as well as surveys, and extending across the two other Slavic post-Soviet republics as well as Russia. These discussions are in turn of continuing interest to public audiences, and to various sets of practitioners (including diplomats and election officials).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0FC1FFF3-4C87-4080-8A2E-68CC61A47E5B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0F518884-9EC8-4E33-A831-A8AEAC6F5729"><gtr:id>0F518884-9EC8-4E33-A831-A8AEAC6F5729</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electoral Integrity and Support for Democracy in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d20194c63e82b79fb543e64bb222c0a3"><gtr:id>d20194c63e82b79fb543e64bb222c0a3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McAllister I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/197CAF0B-86D5-4919-8408-53C8CAEDD8B4"><gtr:id>197CAF0B-86D5-4919-8408-53C8CAEDD8B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Did Russia (Nearly) have a Facebook Revolution in 2011?
