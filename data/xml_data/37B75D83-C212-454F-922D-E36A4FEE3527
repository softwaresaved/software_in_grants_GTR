Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/M007812/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Around the world the prediction of microbial water pollution is important for informing policy decisions in order to safeguard human health. However, modelling the fate and transfer of microbial pollutants, such as E. coli (&amp;amp; other pathogens) at different spatial scales poses a considerable challenge to the research and policy community. In the UK much research has focused on trying to understand the movement &amp;amp; survival of pathogens in environmental systems with a view that better knowledge and data on the behavioural characteristics of these micro-organisms will improve our ability to model and predict their interactions with, and responses to, the world around us. The NERC-funded project ReMOFIO (NE/J004456/1) provides an example of research undertaken in the UK to improve our understanding of the magnitude and spatial distribution of microbial risks in the landscape. In turn, this new knowledge has enabled the refinement of a simple modelling framework to allow for improved prediction of microbial risk on agricultural land, based on livestock numbers, farming practices and E. coli survival patterns under environmental conditions (e.g. rainfall and temperature fluctuations). While this model is useful, its current form makes it inaccessible to a wider audience and, most importantly, hinders its wider uptake by the regulatory community and those with a responsibility for catchment management and environmental decision-making. Indeed, models developed by the scientific community are rarely, if ever, designed in such a way to maximise their appeal to different end-users from the outset. Often what is required to effectively 'open-up' the access of sometimes rather complex science into a more user-friendly format is the development of an interface, or 'front-end', that promotes end-user interaction but keeps the underpinning science hidden from view. A common approach to enable this is the design of a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that allows end-users without specific modelling skills or knowledge of a modelling system to take advantage of existing science and modelling capability. A GUI essentially provides an effective means of translating scientific research into a practical tool for end-users.

In response, this Innovation Project will promote engagement, deliberation and joint decision-making across a range of science providers (researchers) and science users (regulators, catchment managers and farm networks) in an effort to develop a GUI for the ReMOFIO model, and to explore the translation of this GUI into an App-based format too. This represents a critical step for ensuring that this NERC funded model and data delivers real-world impact through innovative conversion of the underpinning evidence-base into a format that is widely accessible by relevant end-users. The aim of the ViPER (Visualising Pathogen &amp;amp; Environmental Risk) project is to facilitate wider access and uptake of this NERC science, by stakeholders, in order to deliver that impact and to ensure that up-to-date insight and knowledge is transferred to the right people both in the right way and at the right time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65431</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Catchment Sensitive Farming visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6EA3E6F0-22DA-489F-BB5B-AA2D05A26F48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To promote the ViPER toolkit to CSF officers.

The resulting toolkit available at www.nercviper.co.uk represents a clear benefit to the end-user community, with the caveat that it will continue to develop and evolve over time.

Without the innovation funding the momentum to convert this existing quality NERC science into a wider and freely available platform would not have been generated. Thus, it is without doubt that a step change in increasing the viability of the project was enabled by the innovation fund.

Additional funding has now been secured from the NERC Innovation call to link the ViPER risk mapping tool with another existing NERC funded risk tool, SCIMAP. This was a direct request from the stakeholders involved in our project. The original short six month programme of KE played a critical role in developing the architecture for a freely-available, user-friendly decision support tool (DST) known as ViPER (www.nercviper.co.uk), but in just six months it was not possible to deliver full functionality (e.g. hydrological risk mapping) within the DST, as had been desired by the end-user community. To convert the ViPER DST to a user-ready version, we sought funds to combine the current ViPER DST with another existing NERC-funded hydrological risk-mapping tool, SCIMAP (NE/C508850/1), in line with end-user requests and feedback. Co-I's Reaney &amp;amp; Heathwaite led the development of this risk mapping framework now widely adopted in the UK; SCIMAP is a risk-mapping tool designed to identify the origins of diffuse pollutants in the landscape through combined assessment of spatial patterns of source risks with hydrological connectivity. By integrating two NERC-funded outputs (ViPER &amp;amp; SCIMAP) that are built on well-established science, we will deliver an innovative DST for mapping microbial pollution risks in catchments. This will provide added value both to land-based assessment of microbial risks &amp;amp; to the interests of environmental regulators and the water industry in the UK (&amp;amp; further afield).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E9D45F42-8D2B-4E07-A44F-340F1CD869C3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Effort over the 6 month period of funding saw the development of an alpha version of the ViPER web-based platform. The project was ambitious in its aims and the free web-based availability of this alpha version of ViPER is a significant achievement. However, the process of stakeholder engagement and co-construction of the toolkit has meant that end-users were keen to ensure the toolkit would work well for them and they have asked for extra functionality beyond the original scope of the project. This adds weight to the rationale for developing such a toolkit but further development is needed. In turn, this has meant that we are still gradually modifying the alpha version of the ViPER toolkit to develop it to a beta stage of release. We are currently doing this in our own time but the toolkit is useable as-is for exploring issues of diffuse microbial pollution. Once we have modified the toolkit to a beta release we will regroup with our project partners and also approach the catchment sensitive farming team again re training opportunities. We are also involved with JHI in a possible Scottish Government funding bid that will potentially see ViPER develop further.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The impact from the project will mature over time and will be enhanced with additional modifications of the ViPER toolkit as it develops into a beta stage of release. The impact thus far has been in bringing the different end-user communities together to agree on a structure for a decision-support-tool to inform on diffuse microbial pollution.

ViPER operates as a freely available web-based interface to guide decision-making with respect to diffuse microbial pollution risk assessment. Its purpose is to demonstrate variability in spatial and temporal FIO source risks on agricultural land in order to inform more effective land management to reduce diffuse microbial pollution from livestock farming. ViPER enables user engagement on three levels: 1) as a demonstration farm environment; 2) as a basic FIO calculator; and 3) as a fully functional spatial &amp;amp; temporal FIO risk-mapping tool. We are developing a policy note for distribution.

The ViPER calculator mode provides a useful tool and allows user defined scenarios, which was welcomed and does provide immediate impact in terms of on-farm advice that can be provided. No participants were aware of a freely-available product that provides information of temporal patterns of E. coli accumulation on pasture as governed by faecal excretion and E. coli die-off.

The most significant impact will arise once the final remaining bugs are fixed, and final modifications implemented, in turn allowing for a wider roll out of the ViPER platform to farm advisors, perhaps most notably the Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Team. They acknowledge that a number of their priority catchments in England have FIO pollution issues and that ViPER could help develop farmer understanding.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C07ADB6D-AD77-41C8-85C5-6BE3E5CB656D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.nercviper.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>ViPER (Visualising Pathogen &amp;amp; Environmental Risk) is a practical tool to enable the visualisation of faecal indicator organism (FIO) source risks in agricultural environments that arise from grazing livestock.
