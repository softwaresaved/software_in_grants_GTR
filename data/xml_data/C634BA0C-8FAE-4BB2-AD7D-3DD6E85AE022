recognition</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I018719/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Biometrics such as face, iris, or fingerprint recognition have received growing attention in the last decade, as automatic identification systems for surveillance and security have started to enjoy widespread diffusion. They suffer, however, from two major limitations: they cannot be used at a distance, and require user cooperation, assumptions impractical in real-world scenarios. Interestingly, psychological studies show that people are capable of recognizing their friends just from the way they walk, even when their gait is poorly represented by point light display. Gait has several advantages over other biometrics, as it can be measured at a distance, is difficult to disguise or occlude, can be identified even in low-resolution images, and is non-cooperative in nature. Furthermore, gait and face biometrics can be easily integrated for human identity recognition.Despite its attractive features, though, gait identification is still far from being ready to be deployed in practice. What limits its adoption in real-world scenarios is the influence of a large number of nuisance factors which affect appearance and dynamics of the gait. These include, for instance: walking surface, lighting, camera setup (viewpoint), but also footwear and clothing, objects carried, time of execution, walking speed. Similar issues are shared by other applications of motion classification, such as action and activity recognition. Multilinear or tensorial models, in which a number of (nuisance) factors linearly mix to generate what we observe (in our case the walking gait), have been proven in the recent past to be able to describe the influence of such factors, for instance in the context of face recognition. However, video sequences are more complex objects than single images. We first need to represent video footages in a compact way.Encoding the dynamics of videos by means of some sort of dynamical model has been proven effective in both action recognition and gait identification, in situations in which the dynamics is critically discriminative. Besides, the actions of interest have to be temporally segmented from a video sequence, while actions of sometimes very different lengths might have to be compared. Dynamical representations are very effective in coping with temporal detection and compression, and indeed several researchers have explored the idea of encoding motions via linear, nonlinear, stochastic or chaotic dynamical systems.In this project, therefore, we propose to develop a novel, general framework for the classification of video sequences (with a focus on the walking gait), based on the application of tensorial decomposition techniques to image sequences represented as realizations of suitable dynamical models.The proposed framework will allow us to deal with the issue of the nuisance factors which greatly affect identification from gait and activity recognition in a principled way. The main goal is to push towards a more widespread diffusion of gait ID, as a concrete contribution to enhancing the security levels in the country in the current, uncertain scenarios. With their implications for crime prevention and security, biometrics and surveillance are fast growing business areas, a fact reflected by the increasing number of government-sponsored initiatives in the area in most advanced economies. In addition, the techniques devised in this proposal are extendable to action and identity recognition with immense commercial exploitation potential, ranging from content-based video retrieval from repositories such as YouTube, to HMI, to interactive video games, etcetera.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Within the private sector companies whose core business is in semi-automatic surveillance or biometrics would be the primary beneficiaries of a robust gait identification system. Most of them focus at the moment on cooperative biometrics such as face or iris recognition: investing in behavioral techniques ahead of the rest of the market could provide them with a significant competitive edge. As large-scale tensor modeling can be useful in many applications, however, companies active in vision or medical imaging, physicians specialized in biometric analysis and sport teams labs could also commercially benefit from this research. We expect policy-makers and government agencies to be attracted by the idea of novel surveillance and biometric systems able to improve the general level of security in the country, and that of sensitive areas in particular. Examples are airport management authorities such as BAA, railway companies, underground and public transport authorities (e.g., Transport for London). The wider public will of course be the ultimate beneficiary of any improvement in the security level in public places and transport. A successful outcome of the project will likely boost the competitiveness of the above mentioned private sector actors, to the economic competitive advantage of the United Kingdom. Companies active in biometrics and surveillance will benefit from privileged access to cutting edge technology in behavioral biometrics. The public sector and the government could potentially see the security level of the country dramatically improved by the adoption of some of the outcomes of this research. The infrastructure is basically already there, as millions of active CCTV cameras make the United Kingdom one of the most surveyed western nations. The UK citizen's quality of life will arguably benefit too, in the longer term, by the deployment of behavioral biometric systems as anti-terrorist measures. Among the indirect benefits to the wider public it is worth to mention the impact on people's health of providing physicians with automatic support in diagnosis based on sophisticated data (e.g., 3D MRI scans) as an application of tensor models. Realistic timescales for such benefits vary with the specific target. To start seeing commercial applications in an initially limited context (e.g. biometric access), an additional three or four years of R&amp;amp;D after the end of the proposed research would be needed, possibly in partnership with a company. It is safer to assume a longer time scale when targeting a wider application to security in public areas. Government or agency support will in this case be crucial. The research assistant working full time on the project will develop a variety of skills he/she could exploit in many possible future employment scenarios. These include: project and website management, Matlab coding and use of sophisticated statistical toolboxes, report and paper writing, professional networking. The proposer belongs to the Oxford Brookes Computer Vision Group, which has very well established channels for technology transfer from research to product and a track record of achieving this. Intellectual Property Rights management and exploitation will be managed by the Research and Business Development Office (RBDO) at Oxford Brookes University. To disseminate our results we plan to arrange seminar days with relevant companies active in the Oxford/London area and beyond. Towards the end of the project, public agencies such as the Transport for London or BAA could be contacted with concrete results to show in order for a proof of concept arrangement to be set up. The Vision Group already enjoys links with HMGCC, the government centre of excellence.

How would we define and describe man-machine or a machine-machine interface and why is it relevant to understanding Artificial Intelligence? Mediator between human (and non-human users) and machines, a man-machine or machine-machine interface, is basically a system that takes care of the entire human-non-human communication process. It is responsible for the delivery of the machine or computer knowledge, functionality and available information, in a way that is compatible with the end-user's communication channels, be it human or non-human. It then translates the user's (human or non-human) actions (user input) into a form (instructions/commands) that is understandable by a machine. 

When increasingly complex Artificial Intelligence based systems, products and services are rapidly emerging across nations, the necessity for more user friendly man-machine or machine-machine interface is becoming increasingly necessary for their effective utilization, and consequently for the success that they were designed for.

In particular, we are interested in testing the possibility of recognizing people's identities at a distance, from the way the walk, or from their gesturing style. The problem is made extremely difficult by the presence of numerous factors which affect recognition, such as different camera viewpoints, illumination conditions, clothing. We have also explored the use of new modeling techniques to automatically learn, represent and recognize complex human activities as those captured by videos stored on YouTube and elsewhere. In the first step crucial information needs to be extracted from these videos. Based on those measurements, the system automatically learn which parts of the video are the most &amp;quot;discriminative&amp;quot; (relevant for recognition purposes) and assembles them in a coherent hierarchy able to describe complex activities, or the presence of multiple actors.

We have obtain significant preliminary results which show that, via these new modelling techniques, recognition rates considerable improve over the current state of the art. Most significantly, we can also localize the presence of an action in space and time within a given video sequence.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The societal impact and market potential of reliable automatic action recognition is enormous. Human-machine interfaces allowing humans to gesturally interact with their laptops, smartphones and even cars are being envisaged right now. ABI Research forecast that 600 million smartphones with gesture recognition features will be shipped in 2017 (http://blog.geoactivegroup.com/2012/07/new-applications-for-gesture.html). EyeSight (http://www.eyesight-tech.com/) already produces software solutions that &amp;quot;allow users to control mobile and portable devices with simple hand gestures&amp;quot;. Smart rooms are being imagined, in which people are assisted in their everyday activities by distributed intelligence in their own homes (switching lights when they move through the rooms, interpreting their gestures to replace remote controls and switches, etcetera). At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, Mercedes-Benz showed an experimental system (DICE) which lets drivers perform basic functions with a hand gesture. Given our rapidly ageing population, semiautomatic assistance to non-autonomous elderly people and remote clinical monitoring are rapidly gaining interest. A hand-gesture recognition system that enables doctors to manipulate digital images during medical procedures has recently been tested at the Washington Hospital (www.whcenter.org). Security personnel can be assisted by algorithms able to signal anomalous events to their attention for surveillance purposes, improving the general level of security of the European Union (and of senstive areas such as airports or train stations in particular) in uncertain times such as ours. In the US, DARPA's Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) and Persistent Stare Exploitation and Analysis System (PerSEAS) programs may soon enable better warfighter analysis of huge amounts of data generated from multiple types of sensors. Companies are investing in &amp;quot;behavioral&amp;quot; biometrics, based on people's distinctive gait pattern, to

achieve a significant competitive edge. Finally, techniques able to efficiently datamine the thousands of videos people post, say, on Facebook or YouTube are in dire need: the potential of a &amp;quot;drag and drop&amp;quot; application, similar to that set up by Google for images, able to retrieve videos with a same &amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot; content is easy to imagine. All these companies are investing huge money on internet video retrieval as the

next level in the browsing experience. Truly robust action recognition is likely to contribute enormously (via significant gains in productivity) to boost all these economic sectors in the near future. A number of routes are open for the exploitation of the results of this project.

New consoles (e.g. Microsoft's Kinect) have opened up novel directions in the gaming industry: yet, these only track the user's movements, without any real interpretation of their actions which could &amp;quot;spice up&amp;quot; the gaming experience. Intelligent action recognition can render games which merely track the user's body posture out of fashion: however, gesture recognition with kinect is still in its infancy (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1wIQ2o4INo). We are exploring the possibility of a collaboration with Sony Entertainment (which has a successful history of KTP project with our group) along these lines. 

We have had a series of promising meetings with Magna International (http://www.magna.com/), the car component company, for a collaboration on pedestrian behavior interpretation in low speed (e.g. parking lot) scenarios, and on driver's gesture recognition inside the car.

Together with Professor Helen Dawes we are also exploring the possibility of using gesture recognition techniques to monitor patients' disease progression from their homes via the analysis of the quality of their exercises, labelled according to standard clinical scales such as SARA (http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/FabioCuzzolin/grants/i4i.pdf).

The results of this project have led to spin off grant applications to the Leverhulme Trust (http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/FabioCuzzolin/grants/leverhulme12video-outline.pdf), NIHR (see above) and the European Union (via an ERC Consolidator grant).

Finally (but the list is not exhaustive), we are considering a new EPSRC application on brain wave remote control based on the tensorial/multilinear analysis developed in this project for identity recognition from gait, as they can be very effective for the classification of EEG signals as well.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>56B3EAF7-BC85-4A5D-A7B0-75D36181E433</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/FabioCuzzolin/grants.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/88D2EBA5-0D96-44F4-AEDE-DB1DB2AB9FFF"><gtr:id>88D2EBA5-0D96-44F4-AEDE-DB1DB2AB9FFF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Learning Pullback HMM Distances.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/eea240e3dd066c41853fa6d5ba37d48c"><gtr:id>eea240e3dd066c41853fa6d5ba37d48c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cuzzolin F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0098-5589</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C1639C05-B6D5-478C-9D51-5EBADC619FA7"><gtr:id>C1639C05-B6D5-478C-9D51-5EBADC619FA7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fisher Tensor Decomposition for Unconstrained Gait Recognition</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b0e385df1cae982c1509bb4c1b4993fe"><gtr:id>b0e385df1cae982c1509bb4c1b4993fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wenjuan Gong (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DD0D67EC-C9BE-439F-8C69-B2BF65A545D0"><gtr:id>DD0D67EC-C9BE-439F-8C69-B2BF65A545D0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Online action recognition via nonparametric incremental learning</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of BMVC 2014</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4146f39dd2b2978a013b6c02aa0cbbc0"><gtr:id>4146f39dd2b2978a013b6c02aa0cbbc0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>De Rosa R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4818EA64-553F-48D9-A4D3-38B826646801"><gtr:id>4818EA64-553F-48D9-A4D3-38B826646801</gtr:id><gtr:title>Learning discriminative space-time actions from weakly labelled videos</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3f2bfe8c5b37a52188eaf17a094b9045"><gtr:id>3f2bfe8c5b37a52188eaf17a094b9045</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fabio Cuzzolin (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C3AEA1F5-F422-4557-9F49-E884A455A9F1"><gtr:id>C3AEA1F5-F422-4557-9F49-E884A455A9F1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metric learning for Parkinsonian identification from IMU gait measurements.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Gait &amp;
