and Ion Sectioning in a Single Instrument</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/P029914/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposed instrument is a novel combination of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) Plasma Focused Ion Beam SIMS (PFIB-SIMS) that provides a step change in performance of state-of-the-art instrumentation in terms of resolution, sensitivity and applicability. Additional features are dual dynamic positive and negative ion detection, micro-structural analysis, electrical and thermal control for the performance of in operando studies and handling of air-sensitive materials by the incorporation of a pre-chamber. This design, unique worldwide, will enable the chemical quantification of complex surfaces with nanometric resolution and 3D chemical and microstructural reconstruction filling the dimensionality gap in the existing SIMS and FIB technology. 
The configuration and components used are at the forefront of materials sectioning and surface characterisation design in a UHV environment. The source of the secondary ions is the gas plasma focused ion beam (FIB) source and column that can produce either oxygen ions or xenon ions with a focus of 25nm for the highest lateral resolutions. This source is also able to section hard and soft materials to length scales of up to a millimetre for sub-surface bulk features by 3D serial-sectioning and characterisation. Low energy surface dosing with caesium is also available for enhancing the secondary ion yields of electronegative elements (e.g. O).
Simultaneous positive and negative SIMS ion detection has been pioneered at Imperial College and is now optimised by ion trajectory modelling in this unique SIMS analysis configuration. Samples with both roughness and form are suitable as low electrical fields are inherent for signal extraction by the two electric quadrupole-based mass spectrometers. Sample cooling and heating is available, also in-situ-electrical contacts for IV testing and grounding at sample surfaces.
Apart from the usual loadlock for a UHV instrument, there will be a second preparation/load-lock chamber for sample processing by temperature control and electrical contacts to mirror the main SIMS analysis chamber facilities. Additionally it will be possible to control the anneal gas ambient to atmospheric pressure with a gas analysis facility. The preparation/load-lock chamber provides a means of transferring air-sensitive samples in vacuum or gas environment from other preparation and characterisation facilities such as a dry Glove-box, SEM, XPS, and Diamond for example. A unique feature of the instrument configuration is the provision for obtaining optical images from samples in both load-locks including optical interference images for topography assessment.
The instrument configuration is designed with inherent future-proofing in mind as both the analysis chamber and the preparation/load-lock have large volumes and spare access ports. In the analysis chamber, the use of a large working distance, ~15mm, low electric field extraction for the SIMS signal and accurate 5-axis stage movements means that there is available solid-angle access to the sample target position within the analysis chamber.
The instrument will be placed in an existing specialist surface analysis laboratory where high performance SIMS/LEIS equipment is located and staffed by permanent ion beam specialists with world leading expertise in optimising ion beam analysis conditions and methodologies. Finally, assistance in data interpretation will be available to the user as well expertise in the operation of High Five.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the research enabled by this proposal will be significant and wide ranging due to the breadth of scientific disciplines of the applicants. The impact of the research will be most immediately felt in the areas of physical, chemical, and biological science, along with the engineering and manufacturing disciplines. The realisation of this globally unique analytical instrument, with unprecedented ion beam specifications coupled with in situ sample preparation, and in operando sample analysis will have a dramatic impact in the field of surface analysis. High Five will place UK scientists at the vanguard of this discipline. 
During the grant period the main areas of academic impact will be in the areas of research as described in the full case for support. In brief, these areas are: energy conversion and storage, engineering alloys, photonic and electronic materials, medical imaging and biomedical science and engineering. In all of these cases, High Five will enable researchers to ascertain a greater understanding of fundamental ionic process that will improved efficiencies and lifetimes of devices, and better understanding of biological processes that cause a range of debilitating diseases. Importantly, the addition of the High Five instrument in the Materials Department will create a globally important hub of excellence in surface analysis and knowledge transfer. The placement of High Five in the well-established surface analysis lab, with a strong history of training and developing expertise in surface analysis, will draw in the best young researchers at both Post-Doc and PhD level. The multidisciplinary aspect of the instrument and lab will be a unique environment for researchers to develop new collaborations, and realise new correlative methods in materials analysis and characterisation. There will also be a great interest from industrial partners for collaborations, as evidenced by the letters of support.
Aside from the academic impacts of the research there will be many industrial and commercial impacts to be gained from the realisation of High Five. The immediate impact of the successful outcome of the proposal will secure the UK's global position as a world leader in high resolution surface analysis instrumentation. The project will also secure and develop both Hiden Analytical and Oregon Physics international competitiveness, expand their instrument repertoires and develop export markets. This collaboration between scientists and instrument developers clearly highlights the need for the exchange of ideas in the field of surface analysis, and adds to the standing of the proposal.
The most important impact of the outputs of High Five will be upon the society at large. The research described in the full case for support is aimed at improving a wide range of facets of the society in which we live. This includes for example, improving our knowledge and understanding in the area of non-fossil based, environmentally benign energy supplies like fuel cells, batteries and supercaps. This will lead to an improved environment for all, more efficient and innovative use of precious resources.
 In the area of healthcare, the planned research will be profound. The work set out in the medical imaging section will aim to optimise therapeutic cancer treatments in order to reduce their unwanted side effects dramatically improving many patient's quality of life. The studies in the biomedical arena aim to investigate the development of AMD, calcification present in atherosclerosis for example, and biological connections between AMD other degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. The positive socio-economic impact of the successful implementation of this unique instrument in the domain of healthcare alone will run to many millions, as a better understanding of these debilitating diseases will result in better treatments, patient care and more efficient use of healthcare finances.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1802539</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P029914/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8ECC9D35-20DE-4F19-8A8A-07D65859D6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Light-Matter Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
