Dynamics</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/H007016/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Soil erosion by water is leading to an accelerated loss of the world's food-producing lands, threatening global food security. Models are a vital component of attempts to understand the impact of agricultural processes, land-use and climate change on soil erosion. However, current approaches to modelling soil erosion, despite a long heritage, have shown little overall improvement in their predictive capability. All models are constrained by the experimental base upon which they rests, much of which, for soil erosion, dates from experiments and technologies of a generation ago. Thus far, technological limitations have constrained experimental work to steady-state measurements for what is actually a highly dynamic process. For example, experiments to derive the parameters of soil-erosion models typically use constant-intensity rainfall and then apply these parameters to model erosion under temporally varying natural rainfall, although we now have evidence that parameters derived in this way will make incorrect predictions for temporally varying natural rainfall. A way out of this impasse is to use optical diagnostic techniques, developed in the field of mechanical engineering, which enable the study of highly dynamic multiphase flows. Recent developments in pulsed laser-illumination sources and digital camera technology allow the recording of particle/flow interactions at rates up to 20,000 frames per second. Using these techniques it is now possible to make a step change in our understanding of the dynamics of processes of soil erosion. This research will (i) refine existing high-speed, high-resolution imaging and PIV techniques to track sediment particles of 0.063 mm to 2.0 mm simultaneously in shallow overland flows that typify soil erosion; (ii) use these refined techniques to develop datasets of high resolution and high accuracy that will characterize the dynamics of the different components of the detachment, transport and deposition processes in shallow overland flows; (iii) make these datsets available to the wider soil-erosion community for their own model development and testing; (iv) use the data obtained to develop submodels within an existing soil-erosion model (MAHLERAN) which we have previously developed that are capable of representing dynamic properties of erosion processes, rather than steady-state conditions; and (v) test the revised version of MAHLERAN against existing datasets for unsteady conditions. The work will provide an important contribution to key NERC Strategy areas such as Living with Environmental Change and the analysis of the impact of environmental change on ecosystem services, with consequences in terms of sustainability, global poverty and carbon sequestration. The research will also lead to the production of more effective tools for environmental managers to implement practices of integrated river-basin management as required under current legislation such as the EU Water Framework and Nitrates Directives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>356450</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cross-disciplinary research partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>90C15766-5D43-4608-8EF4-CD6447CDA4CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publications

This research has developed high-speed, high-resolution imaging and particle tracking techniques to track sediment particles of 0.063 mm to 2.0 mm simultaneously in shallow overland flows that typify soil erosion; (ii) used these refined techniques to develop datasets of high resolution and high accuracy to characterize the dynamics of the different components of the detachment, transport and deposition processes in shallow overland flows; (iii) the knowledge gained from this work, including data has been made available to the wider soil-erosion community through a series of publications; (iv) the data obtained has been used to continue the development of sub-models within an existing soil-erosion model (MAHLERAN) which we have previously developed that are capable of representing dynamic properties of erosion processes, rather than steady-state conditions. 

A significant achievement of the project has been to investigate the interaction that occurs between an impacting water-droplet and a granular bed of loose graded sand in order to understand its role in erosion processes. High-speed imaging, three-dimensional time-resolved particle tracking, and photogrammetric surface profiling have been used to examine individual impact events. Much of the work has focused on the quantification and trajectory analysis of the particles ejected from the sand bed, along with measurement of the change in bed morphology. The results from the experiments have detailed two distinct mechanisms of particle ejection: the ejection of water-encapsulated particles from the edge of the wetted region, and the ejection of dry sand from the periphery of the impact crater. That the process occurs by these two distinct mechanisms has hitherto been unobserved. Presented in the paper are distributions of the particle ejection velocities, angles and transport distances for both mechanisms. The ejected water-encapsulated particles, which are few in number, are characterized by low ejection angles and high ejection velocities, leading to large transport distances; the ejected dry particles, which are much greater in number, are characterized by high ejection angles and low velocities, leading to lower transport distances. From the particle ejection data, the momentum of the individual ballistic sand particles has been calculated; it was found that only 2% of the water-droplet momentum at impact is transferred to the ballistic sand particles. In addition to the particle tracking, surface profiling of the granular bed post-impact has provided detailed information on its morphology; these data have demonstrated the consistent nature of the craters produced by the impact, and suggest that particle agglomerations released from their edges make up about twice the number of particles involved in ballistic ejection. It is estimated that overall, about 4% of the water-droplet momentum is taken up in particle movement.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results from this work will continue to impact erosion model development and provide a basis for further studies looking at more complex multi-droplet interactions and real hill-slope scenarios.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>988C1215-5A44-4F01-A6DC-0CCAF8CC73CD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/draem/index</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/05F8EE59-09E9-4E3B-839C-3FBF3B9378BF"><gtr:id>05F8EE59-09E9-4E3B-839C-3FBF3B9378BF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Using Particle Imaging Velocimetry and Radio Frequency Identification to gain insights into erosion processes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f79b933ecd262f47f4e91602de8555af"><gtr:id>f79b933ecd262f47f4e91602de8555af</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parsons A.
