One aspect of this challenge that has received little attention is the concept of time. Museums have traditionally used linear time concepts - chronological timelines, or sociological periods such as king's reigns -- as organising frameworks for their narratives. Whether one uses a linear, circadian or cyclical method of presenting time, the use of a particular time concept can function to suppress certain points of view about the meaning and significance of museum artefacts when interpreted for exhibition. For example, placing a series of events along a timeline inevitability creates a sense of commensurability between historical experiences that will only be valid from a certain ideological perspective. In fact, the very use of a linear timeline denotes the existence of 'progress' which is a Western invention that does not necessarily concur with notions of time and evolution used by non-Western cultures.

This research will explore concepts of time used in museum interpretation and display in order to raise awareness of, and make more transparent, the ideological assumptions that underpin seemingly innocuous temporal frameworks. This will, in turn, start a discussion about how competing time concepts can be used to present different philosophies, beliefs and ideas in object interpretation and presentation. The overall objective is to make museum interpretation more inclusive and engaging for a range of audiences. The key research questions that will be explored are:

1.To what extent does reliance of linear time concepts in museum displays limit interpretive opportunities, exclude voices and/or discourage the public from engaging with collections?
2.What other time concepts might be employed by museums to give a more complex and multi-layered view of the meaning and significance of objects?
3.How can digital tools be used inside and outside museum spaces to present different concepts of time and create new time relationships between visitors and objects?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Social impact is integral to the design of the proposed research project. The action research methodology that will be used to understand the influence of different concepts of time on museum interpretation and display will involve intended beneficiaries from the start. The development of the 'test bed' exhibition and digital resource will be based, in part, on the results of public workshops and events during the initial research period. As stated in the Case for Support, this will be an iterative process in which expected beneficiaries will feed into the research throughout the process and the research team will attempt to respond visibly to feedback by altering research outputs in a way that leaves traces of the evolution of thought. Not only will this research method facilitate a more rapid transfer of knowledge into practice, it will support a more open and participatory model of museum engagement generally. Over the past two years, the Petrie has run a successful 'demo' series in which visitors have been invited to test new digital technologies being developed by UCL researchers. The Petrie will draw on this model and expertise to attract visitors to take part in and respond to this research. Furthermore, in this instance there is an opportunity for this research to have permanent impact on the host research institution -- the Petrie Museum is currently planning to move to a new location in 2015 and will use this research as the basis for planning its displays.

The expected audience for the research activities includes museum and teaching professionals, UCL staff and students and Petrie Museum visitors. Museum and teaching professionals will be recruited to take part in focus group sessions with academics and invited to public events via professional networks and channels such as the Museums Association, Arts Council England's Museums Development programme, and UCL's schools outreach programme. UCL staff and students and Petrie Museum visitors will be made aware of research-related events and workshops through the established marketing channels. 

The long-term objective of this exploratory research is to up open new avenues for interpretation and display in museums through the use of alternative time concepts and temporary frameworks. The underlying rationale for this research is that when museums offer diverse view points, they are better able to attract diverse audiences. Hence, the ultimate beneficiaries of this research are those populations who currently feel excluded from museums. According to the 2011 report by the New Economic Foundation and Museum of East Anglian Life entitled 'The Happy Museum: A tale of how it could turn out all right', museums can play a significant role in promoting community cohesion and personal well-being, but they can only do so when all members of society feel comfortable in their spaces and have a sense of connectedness to their collections. While many museums focus on creating public programmes that cater to diverse audiences or providing social services as part their offer, the role that interpretation and display play in reaching new audiences has been forgotten. This exploratory research seeks to challenge traditional notions of time that underpin the 'Grand Narrative' and thereby offer the opportunity for new narratives that are more inclusive to be generated.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23831</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An interactive installation in the main gallery of the Petrie Museum at UCL was used to raise awareness of different methods of charting time. https://cathyhaynes.org/2016/05/20/a-storm-is-blowing/</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE82ABD5-E92F-42D9-AE97-A187C1603120</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The installation set the stage for a series of events in which the public engaged with UCL academics on perceptions on time and how they shape how we live.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Timekeeper in Residence and Art Installation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://cathyhaynes.org/2016/05/20/a-storm-is-blowing/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Timekeeper in Residence workshops</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>46B555FB-D10A-484F-BDC2-0436798640BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Petrie Museum's Timekeeper in Residence, artist-curator Cathy Haynes invites you to take part in two creative workshops where you'll help invent maps and models of how time is actually lived.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K005251/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A30C52-7659-4E94-B5E2-F9BB53767467</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeological Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8BB67751-1AD5-4EE8-9104-089D5F236DDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Digital Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70CA9DF8-AFD4-43E6-BEE7-634724581BE7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inter-faith Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
