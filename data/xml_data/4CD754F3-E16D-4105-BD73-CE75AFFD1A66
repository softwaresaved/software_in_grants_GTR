It brings together over 50 key individuals and organisations from 15 countries worldwide that are active in the field of diagnostics and antimicrobial resistance. This unprecedented body of expertise and the access it brings to national and international institutions, and networks will amplify the reach and implementation of the working group's outputs. The working group will focus on human healthcare but also recognises the importance of a wider perspective including environmental and veterinary aspects.

This unprecedented body of expertise and the access it brings to national and international institutions, and networks will amplify the reach and implementation of the working group's outputs. AMR-RDT will concentrate on five overarching topics: Need &amp;amp; Target Product Profiles, Technologies, Development Roadmaps, Business Models, and Behavioural Change. The working group will focus on human healthcare but also recognises the importance of One Health aspects. AMR-RDT is funded as a one-year project by the UK Medical Research Council under the frame of the Joint Planning Initiative on AMR (JPIAMR) and is coordinated by Till Bachmann at the University of Edinburgh.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a major threat to healthcare systems and societies on a global scale and is discussed at the highest policy levels. AMR concerns all parts of society and to tackle it, multi-sectorial and interdisciplinary actions are required. Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) are urgently needed to enhance the rational use of antibiotics, tailor individual patient treatment and management in human and veterinary medicine, facilitate surveillance, allow the development and use of narrow spectrum antibiotics and improve drug-specific companion RDT. Despite a strong demand for rapid diagnostic tests and step changes in technology, the uptake and adoption of new tests has been slower than expected. In order to overcome existing barriers, the AMR-RDT working group will form a coordinated, international forum for RDT stakeholders from all relevant disciplines, sectors and geographies. It will present recommendations to the research community, RDT businesses (IVD, pharma, supplier), funders, insurers/payors, healthcare staff, patients, the general public and international policy makers, to enhance and promote the development, uptake and use of AMR RDTs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45205</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P026222/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E8160779-C41E-46F6-B795-59C27D6B2E2B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.3  Influences and impact</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>5191BE6E-A234-4D62-A4F3-B50DBAAE8217</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.5  Resources and infrastructure (detection)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
