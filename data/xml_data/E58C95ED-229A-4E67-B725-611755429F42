This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Complement regulator proteins (CReg) are broadly expressed on a wide variety of tissues and cells and act as physiologic brakes to complement (C) amplification. CReg are overexpressed on a number of solid tumours as compared to the normal surrounding tissue. Consequently, the increased C resistance conferred by these membrane-bound CReg has been proposed as a mechanism that facilitates survival of the tumours. My pilot studies have investigated the mechanisms of increased resistance of neuroblastoma tumours to C-mediated lysis as a result of treatment with chemotherapeutics. I hypothesise that suppression of expression of CReg CD59 in neuroblastoma will contribute to increased susceptibility of tumours to C attack and their better immunoclearance. 

Here I propose a new strategy for the development of inhibitors of CD59. Candidate proteins up-regulating CReg in neuroblastoma cells will be identified. Recombinant prodrug proteins that activate in tumour environment and suppress expression of CD59 will be designed. Experiments to show therapeutics effect on cultured cancer cells will be performed. The most promising therapeutic agents will be tested on mouse models of human cancer. 

Goals:
1. Derive comprehensive description of the mechanisms of overexpression of CReg CD59 in neuroblastoma.
2. Design recombinant therapeutic proteins suppressing expression of CD59.
3. Characterize consequences for immunoclearance of cancer as a result of treatment with the above therapeutics combined with existing chemo- and antibody therapies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>417213</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>County Emergency Hospital, Cluj-Napoca</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Romania</gtr:country><gtr:description>Dr Bogdan Voinescu</gtr:description><gtr:id>23D090CC-9E58-4A2C-BA3A-A4927DE8AD47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary collaboration (Psychiatry and Biochemistry)
