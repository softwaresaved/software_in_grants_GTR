projects</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L013681/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Reducing (and shifting) energy demand is a vital component to more sustainable energy use. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are a key enabling factor to improved demand management, opening (in principle at least) the road not only to smart meters and smart grids, but also to smart citizens who are more aware of their energy use and are acting on that information to reduce energy bills and energy wastage in their daily life.

The Research Councils UK, through their Digital Economy and Energy programmes, are supporting a very substantial amount of research on the impacts of digital innovation on energy demand reduction in all aspects of life. In total &amp;pound;22 million has been committed to 22 interdisciplinary research projects under two related calls; 'Transforming Energy Demand through Digital Innovation' (TEDDI, 2009) and 'Transforming Energy Demand in Buildings through Digital Innovation' (BuildTEDDI, 2011). No fewer than 29 universities and over 70 high-profile commercial and government organisations are involved in the (Build)TEDDI programme. Across such a large programme there are many potential opportunities for collaboration, including knowledge sharing, pooling of resources, collaborative data mining etc. But with each project team needing to focus on the delivery of their own research objectives, there is little time and breathing space to explore, build and maintain collaborations across the 21 projects. 

We are asking for resources to create a network for all the (build)TEDDI projects to ensure that all opportunities for collaboration are identified and utilised. Over a 4 year period we propose a range of activities to improve communication and knowledge exchange between research and stakeholder communities (industry sectors and policy makers), to build a strong and cohesive research community and maximise academic collaboration between the 22 (build)TEDDI projects for improved project outputs and increased research impacts. 

We have deeloped plans for a total of 14 different types of activities, including engagement with relevant industry sectors to ensure that research findings, experiments and experiences are stimulating innovations and industrial development; stronger and more sustained debate with policy makers to improve the provision of evidence for policy; a 'single shop front' to present all (Build)TEDDI projects and their outputs to date; a pooling of research data and academic publications; systematic and comprehensive dissemination programme of project findings to targeted audiences and stakeholders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>TEDDINET impacts will be of benefit to many industry, policy maker and public stakeholders including: 
-Department for Energy and Climate Change
-Department of Business Skills and Innovation
-OFGEM
-'Big 6' Energy Companies (iBritish Gas, E.On, EdF etc)
-SME Tech Companies (GEO, Sentec, NI)
-SmartGridGB
-Technology Strategy Board
-Energy Technologies Institute
-Research &amp;amp; Commercialisation Networks (ARCC, MBE KTN, UKERC NERN, Smart Grid GB)
-IT Companies (INTEL, IBM, O2, Telefonica)
-Local Government Organisations
-Housing Associations
-Built Environment &amp;amp; Smart Meter Stakeholders (CIBSE, BRE, EST)

We have put in place a number of activities to ensure that impacts are delivered throughout the network's duration and have a long-lasting influence on the future policy direction and commercialisation pathways. In summary this includes:

- High-profile Annual Meetings to bring together the key stakeholders to discuss emerging High-Level themes in digital innovation and energy demand
- Thematic workshops to explore specific issues within the (Build)TEDDI scope and consolidate expert knowledge in this area
- Final events for TEDDINET including a 'technical commercialisation' event to accelerate uptake of the research outputs
- Three High-Level Theme annual reports for Years 1, 2, and 3 (drawing on Annual Meeting, Thematic Workshops and other evidence-gathering)
- Final report on High-Level Themes in Year 4 (drawing on the Final Meeting, the Technical Commercialisation Event and Thematic Workshops)
- A 'Strategic Research Agenda' report in Year 4 (including recommendations for research funders on future direction and priorities for TEDDI research)

In addition TEDDINET will play a key role in data curation, ensuring this takes place for the (Build)TEDDI projects. EPSRC have recently funded an End-Use Energy Demand Research Centre for Energy Epidemiology (CEE). TEDDINET will work with CEE and others to provide: i) advice on data curation and legacy to the (Build)TEDDI projects; ii) identification of a suitable data archive facility; iii) monitoring on the progress of data archiving within the (Build)TEDDI programme; iv) promoting the Open Access goals of RCUK; and v) dissemination of the archived data to maximise the impacts of the (Build)TEDDI datasets.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>559981</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>first network workshop hosted by a participating project, in Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D8A2245A-FF42-43EB-80D6-9BAFA3EEEF8A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>academic workshop, attended by 44 UK based researchers in the area of digital economy and energy demand

ReCoVER: Research on Changes of Variability and Environmental Risk
TEDDINET: Transforming Energy Demand through Digital Innovation NETwork

The aim of the workshop was to explore themes for research that may in the long term help manage the relationship between variability of weather/climate and of water/energy use and create new links for future collaboration between members of two different disciplinary networks. 
the workshop explored some of the shared research challenges that arise from:
- Relations between weather variability and energy demand.
- Relations between weather variability and renewable energy generation.
