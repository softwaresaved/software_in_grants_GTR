In these texts the theories of cyclical time, in particular, are found in a highly developed form, and there is little trace of the processes through which their development occurred in texts prior to this. Previous attempts to find antecedents for the classical theories have focused on specific features, such as the names of the ages that mark the stages of the cycle, and have yielded relatively few results. In this project I focus on the broader structure of the cycle as the starting point for the search, and attempt to trace a stage in its development by looking at temporal cycles of creation, decline and renewal in earlier texts, particularly the Brahmanas. \n\nIn the course of this, the project also examines the relationship between the theories of time and the doctrine of Visnu's periodic incarnation as an avatara, where he takes an animal or human form in order to establish dharma: the moral, social and physical well-being of the cosmos. My research in this area suggests that the ideas of both cyclical time and the avatara were closely linked in their development and that early statements of the avatara doctrine should be read against this background. Through previous work on theories of time in the Mahabharata, I have come to think that the relationship between time and the king is a crucial point of entry for the development of both ideas. The Mahabharata contains many statements that 'the king makes the age' and in my analysis of these statements (Research on South Asia, 2007) I concluded that the idea of the four ages may have developed within the specific context of the text's understanding of the relationship between the king, time and the cosmos. I also argued that this understanding followed on from that found in the earlier Brahmana texts, where, according to Heesterman's analysis, the king played a crucial role in the ritual regeneration of the cosmos in an annual cycle. This project explores the relationship between these ideas within the context of the development of the classical Hindu theories of time and incarnation. It posits a broad developmental sequence in which an annual cycle of disintegration and renewal centred on the ritual role of the king in the Brahmanas formed the model and conceptual basis for a network of ideas about the nature of the king, time and the cosmos which appear to have been crucial for the development of the classical theories. \n\nThe role of the king, the renewal of time, and the idea of the avatara most obviously coalesce in the Mahabharata in the figure of Kalkin, a king who inaugurates the renewal of the classical yuga cycle and who comes to be identified as an avatara by later tradition. By exploring the nature and role of Kalkin more closely, and connecting it with ideas of kingship, time and renewal found in the earlier texts, the project explores the hypothesis that the avatara's establishment of dharma in the classical yuga cycle is a development of the regenerative role of the king in the annual cycles of the earlier texts.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15205</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Duties of the King and the Welfare of the People: Exploring Issues of Human Rights in the Mahabharata</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:id>C8685074-F375-43F9-A671-BBD444B6D1A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper given at the Sanskrit Tradition in the Modern World symposium, Manchester University, May 2011</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Are Human Rights Western: Unpacking the Issues'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>31F30AE0-C0FA-4471-8CFC-DFB1A1D4E906</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper given at the Social Science Research Seminar, Roehampton University</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Duties of the King and the Welfare of the People: Exploring Issues of Human Rights in the Mahabharata's Rajadharmaparva</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B78BE223-506C-40BA-849E-CE60BB6B2DAA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper given at international conference on Asian Religious Values and Social Justice, Lancaster University, September 2011</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>They have been presented at several conferences</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>605A18D7-EF71-4377-816D-43D6E271FDFC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project set out to explore the relationship between kingship, time and incarnation in ancient Indian text, to test the hypothesis that the classical Hindu concepts of avat_ra (periodic incarnations of the god Vi__u) and yuga (repeated revolutions of cyclical time) may have developed within the context of ideas concerning the nature of the king and his influence on cosmic, social and moral well-being (dharma). These ideas were to be explored primarily in the epic Mah_bh_rata, as well as in some earlier texts such as the Br_hma_as. 



The project began with a detailed study of the section of the Mah_bh_rata most closely concerned with kingship, the R_jadharmaparva of Book 12. This study suggested that a more thorough investigation into the nature of kingship in the Mah_bh_rata was both a necessary preliminary to forging any such developmental links and also an important area of research in its own right, especially given the paucity of existing literature. Consequently, the remainder of the project focussed on establishing more clearly the nature of kingship in the Mah_bh_rata, looking primarily at aspects which were either crucial for the developmental hypothesis put forward, or that emerged particularly strongly from the text. These constituted: the king's relationship to the natural world, moral order, and the functioning and well-being of the cosmos; the sources and nature of the king's authority; the relationship between the king and his people; the use of narrative and metaphor to construct and explore these ideas. 



In regard to the first of these, the key finding was that the maintenance of moral and cosmic order was indeed fundamental to the role of the king, as hypothesised: it provided the foundation for the king's authority; a standard against which his actions could be judged; a metaphysical backdrop underpinning practical details of kingship, polity and governance. In regard to the second, the study suggested, contra existing research, that the king's authority could not be seen as either primarily metaphysical (based on a concept of divine kingship) or primarily political (based on a form of proto-constitutional discourse) but rather blended both: the details of the king's rule could be seen as a foundation for ideas of polity but was always situated against the broader metaphysical backdrop of dharma, as was any understanding of the king's divinity. Perhaps the most important finding lay in the exploration of the relationship between the king and his people. As well as exploring the nature, details and expression of this within the text, the research suggested that this relationship could be explored in relation to attempts at establishing duties and obligations underlying relations between citizens and state. These were further examined in the light of the principles and substance of contemporary human rights, opening up a channel for interdisciplinary study of human rights and culture which is ongoing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Although the study was primarily academic and theoretical, both in terms of the textual study and also in the broader comparison with human rights theory, there is scope for the findings and approach to be expanded into more practical issues of human rights practice . Current discussions of human rights and cultural relativity suggest that the use of 'internal critiques', arising from within the cultural foundations of the society concerned, can be more effective than the imposition of so-called 'universal' principles and practices which are, more often, identified as Western and problematic. There would appear to be some potential for utilising some of the underlying principles of social justice and political obligation found in the textual exposition of the traditional duties of the king as a basis for a tradition specific critique of some key human rights issues. Any such development of the findings would, however, be both complex and sensitive, requiring a more careful interdisciplinary focus than was possible in the original project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0CEFCD7E-9071-4046-8045-3BF7413598B3</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H001786/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>579CC04C-737A-43C0-AA54-29DF21AF2C4D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hinduism</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
