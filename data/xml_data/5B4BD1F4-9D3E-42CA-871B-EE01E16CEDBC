Despite the historical and cultural prominence of the group, there is little agreement on the development of Hausa social and political organisation. The proposed workshops are based on two premises:\n\n1.Religion is key to understanding the evolution of Hausa ethnicity in West Africa.\n\n2.Due to the scarcity of written records on the early history of the Hausa, new work must rely on an interdisciplinary approach. \n\nOur workshops will advance current knowledge of Hausa history and explore changes in the notion of Hausa ethnic identity by bringing together the contributions of scholars from different disciplines. Together we shall consider historical texts, archaeological remains, social customs, and language change, focusing on the central themes of religion and identity. \n\nHistorically, the Hausa heartland of northern Nigeria and southern Niger was divided into separate 'city-states,' which exhibited distinct social and cultural traits. Outside this area, the Hausa became known and influential in the entire sub-region due to their traditional association with manufacture and trade. The recent history of the Hausa has been characterised by a great degree of change, especially in terms of religious identity. It is known that the first Hausa people were pagan, but Islam played an increasing role in society over time. A local historical text, the Kano Chronicle, suggests that traders and missionaries from the West brought Islam to some of the Hausa cities in the fourteenth century, but influences from the east, where some elites had converted to Islam in the eleventh century, must have also been important. The number of individuals who accepted Islam was probably small at first, and traditional religious beliefs and practices continued to exist. But by the fifteenth century Hausa cities were linked to the Islamic world system, and in the nineteenth century Hausaland became integrated, through conquest in the course of a holy war (jihad), within an Islamic government known as the Sokoto Caliphate. Written records shed some light on the last 200 years, documenting changes brought on by movements of Islamic reform and conversion, and certainly in the past century being Hausa has been seen as synonymous with being Muslim. However, many Hausa groups still engage in Animist rituals and beliefs, and some minorities have recently embraced Christianity. Syncretism, the merging of religions, has in fact probably been a characteristic feature of Hausa society for centuries. It has recurrently been challenged by waves of reformism, and the recent radicalisation of certain interpretations of Islam is threatening the capacity of Hausa people to retain different religious practices in a climate of tolerance and respect for religious diversity.\n\nThe workshops will advance knowledge of an important West African society by assessing how people's sense of identity ('being Hausa') has changed over time, and what the impact of Islam has been. We will publish our findings in a volume which will not only contribute to Hausa studies, but will also put forward hypotheses applicable to other parts of West Africa and the world. Today, religion plays a major role in defining, and often dividing, communities. Our workshops will challenge increasing religious intolerance by focusing on the historical roots of religious pluralism, syncretism, and the peaceful integration of creeds in West African society. We aim in this way to advance existing understandings of African history and society, and thereby benefit both specialists and the wider public.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12198</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Collaboration with City Academy, Norwich</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78B78352-7664-41A8-9C19-91A230DEC6DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Depicting identities in Africa and the UK: learning from the Hausa of West Africa.
This project was funded under the AHRC/ESRC Youth Impact Competition. It enabled us to bring into contact secondary schoolchildren from the UK and Niger (West Africa), to help them challenge stereotypes they held about each other and to think more critically about how individuals and institutions make snap judgements about others, especially when it comes to emotional topics such as religion or ethnicity.
The project was based at a local secondary school, City Academy Norwich, involving about 20 pupils in the top set and with a strong focus on cross-curricular integration. Within the existing timetable, classroom and museum-based activities drew out aspects of religion and identity over time. In addition, pupils took part in a series of exchanges with peers in the Lyc?e Ahmadu Kurandaga, a secondary school in the largely Hausa-speaking town of Zinder, Niger. Those students, numbering 26, were slightly older (since their English was thus more advanced). Pupils interacted via Skype, email, and postal letter. Together they created 'fact files' about one another, which they exchanged by email. We encouraged pupils to reflect on two fronts: the way in which their identity is historically constructed, and whether their notions of the others' country might be shaped by stereotypes, perhaps promoted by the media.
The main part of the project ran between March and June 2012, when activities involving the schoolchildren took place. Hannah Swain, my counterpart at City Academy, and I had several planning meetings prior to that period, while I was in continual contact with our Zinder facilitator, IT technician Hamza Amadou. Hannah and I also held several meetings over the late summer of 2012 in order to develop the teaching resource, liaising by email with my former doctoral student Laura de Becker who was assisting with this dimension.
The lessons at City Academy began with four weekly hour-long introductory sessions introducing pupils to the project and beginning their critical engagement with notions of identity and stereotypes. These four sessions ran over March. They broke down roughly into four subject areas - geography, history, religion and citizenship, although we made no attempt to impose arbitrary divisions. Students first looked at preconceived ideas about Africa and the way in which Africa is presented in the media. They created and presented a news report from an African country, which was filmed. In a second session, they investigated a famous African past or present, and created a display to educate the rest of the class; these displays were peer assessed. In a third session, students discussed Christian and Muslim pilgrimage with Hajj and examined the reasons why somebody might want to take part in a pilgrimage. In a final session students were asked to examine the attitude of the media to teenagers, and to debate the ways in which teenagers are portrayed. They were asked whether this is a fair or balanced picture and were encouraged then to relate this to the question of the media coverage generally, linking back to the first session. 
Phase 2 of the project, over April and May, were morning-long weekly sessions. They involved live exchanges, through Skype, with the Lyc?e Ahmadu Kurandaga in Zinder. Each of these sessions was conceived of as a part of a gradually-developing research project led by the students, during which they acquired information about their peers at the partner school. At the same time more formal lessons introduced new aspects and lines of thought. 
To begin with, students exchanged information on what they knew about each other's country, became acquainted with each other, and devised biographies about one another. 
In the second session, Laura de Becker, a former UEA student, delivered a lesson, simultaneously fed to pupils at the Lyc?e Ahmadu Kurandaga, regarding the manipulation of ethnicity by the colonial authorities and the disastrous effect this had in past instances such as the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The idea here was to discuss notions of 'ethnic' versus 'religious' versus 'national' identity. 
The following week, a trip to a Norwich church converted into an art foundation was led by one of its trustees, UEA art history senior lecturer Margit Th?fner. This lesson invited pupils to think about the shared notions of angels and light in Christianity and Islam (and, thinking of the local roots of many of the City Academy children, the role of the production of stained glass in Norfolk in conveying those concepts). The Zinder schoolchildren were obviously not able to accompany their UK peers on that field trip, but they shared commentaries online afterwards. 
In a fourth session, a visiting researcher talked to the City Academy students about the difficulties in defining 'Englishness' or 'Britishness' - this was in essence a counterpoint to the earlier lesson on ethnic identity in Niger. Again this lesson was shared with the Niger students. 
In the final session at City Academy students helped prepare a Nigerian-themed meal, which was a great success. 
After these five sessions the exchanges between City Academy and Lyc?e Ahamdou Kourandaga pupils were formally concluded, but they have informally continued between some pupils in their own time.

The third phase, which ran directly on from the Phase 2 lessons, involved two lessons spent not at City Academy but at the University of East Anglia's Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. During these, students were able to explore the galleries, which include an internationally-renowned collection of European, African, American and Pacific art. They were asked to reflect on how and why particular objects might appeal to them and what they meant to them. They were given a lesson by visiting curators from the British Museum, who brought with them items from the museum's Hausa holdings. The students devised a guided tour of the gallery and delivered it to peers who had not as yet been involved in the project. The aim of these two final lessons was to introduce the pupils from City Academy - a school with traditionally extremely low Higher Education participation rates - to the university context. 
As this project gained momentum, it brought in unplanned participants. The UEA languages department sent an observer in relation with their ongoing project 'Norwich - City of Interculture', while the UEA Outreach office became involved in the sessions held on campus, deploying student ambassadors to talk to the City Academy pupils and to encourage them to consider university application in due course. All of the speakers who delivered lessons, Dr Laura de Becker who helped devise the project teaching resource, as well as Hannah Swain and myself, found the project enriching, challenging us to think more critically about our teaching practice.
A web-based teaching resource was produced. Its aim is to bring to a wider audience the activities of our project. Through its cross-curricular slant linked into Key Stage 3 of the recently revised National Curriculum, the resource is intended to support UK schools in implementing an integrated project which will enable students to make links between different subject areas. Produced by Hannah Swain, Laura De Becker and myself, the website can be found on https://sites.google.com/site/depictingafrica/. We publicised the resource (and the wider project) through internal newsletters and through my blog (www.crossroadsofempires.wordpress.com) and it was discussed in the Times Education Supplement and the LSE Public Policy Group. 









The schoolchildren from Norwich substantially altered their negative preconceptions regarding West Africa; this video, which they made, tells the story in their own words: https://sites.google.com/site/depictingafrica/home/video</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/depictingafrica/home</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4334</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Youth Impact</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F6F72A8A-79F5-4205-8C7B-ADF12317CBED</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The network has led to a landmark publication in Hausa studies featuring papers by participants entitled Being and Becoming Hausa published by Brill in 2010, which has become the fourth bestselling volume in their African Social Studies series.

It also generated follow-on funding from the AHRC/ESRC as part of the 'Youth impact' scheme. It followed up with schoolchildren in Norwich, UK, and Zinder, Niger, West Africa, the problem of negative media representations of West Africa, and the problems of stereotyping generally.

From the fifteenth century onwards, the vast town walls, the network of trade links and the manufacturing activities of the Hausa cities was a source of wonder to external observers. But despite the historical and cultural prominence of the group, there is little agreement on the development of Hausa social and political organisation. We therefore organised two workshops aimed at advancing these questions. They took as a basic premise that religion is key to understanding the evolution of Hausa identity, and used an interdisciplinary approach to unlock new insights on the subject. 

Historically, the Hausa heartland of northern Nigeria and southern Niger was split into separate 'city-states,' which exhibited distinct social and cultural traits. Outside this area, the Hausa became known and influential in all of West Africa and beyond for their manufacture and trade. The recent history of the Hausa has been characterised by a great degree of change, especially in terms of religious identity. It is known that the first Hausa people were pagan, but Islam (perhaps filtering through traders) played an increasing role in society over time. The number of individuals who accepted Islam was probably small at first, and traditional religious beliefs and practices continued to exist. But by the fifteenth century Hausa cities were linked to the Islamic world system, and in the nineteenth century Hausaland became integrated, through conquest in the course of a holy war (jihad), within an Islamic government known as the Sokoto Caliphate. Written records shed some light on the last 200 years, documenting changes brought on by movements of Islamic reform and conversion, and certainly in the past century being Hausa has been seen as synonymous with being Muslim. However, many Hausa groups still engage in Animist rituals and beliefs, and some minorities have recently converted to Christianity. The merging of religions has probably been characteristic of Hausa society for centuries - as has, apparently, a climate of tolerance and respect for religious diversity.

With the above issues in mind, our workshops brought together scholars from different disciplines for two meetings (July 2008, Norwich; November 2008, Liverpool). In the course of these workshops, we considered historical, anthropological, archaeological, museological, economic and linguistic evidence to assess how people's sense 'being Hausa' has changed over time, and what has been the impact of Islam. 

The substantially edited and peer-reviewed papers generated a book, 'Being and becoming Hausa: interdisciplinary perspectives' (Brill 2010). The book inscribes itself in a wider critical engagement with the changing relevance of ethnicity in Africa, taking the bold move of addressing this question from a multidisciplinary and diachronic perspective. It thus confronts long unanswered dilemmas of Hausa history, and enables contributors to think reflexively about the role of disciplinary conceptual frameworks in shaping research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project led to a follow-on Impact project (funded by the Religion and Society Programme). The PI led a session in a local secondary school, in collaboration with a Year 7 teacher there, aiming to challenge pupils' stereotypes of Africa.
