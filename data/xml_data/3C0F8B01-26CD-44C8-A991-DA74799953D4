We have a novel design of Broad Band Sound Attenuating Device, which can be configured to operate in a wide variety of situations. Our small-scale laboratory prototype performs better than conventional barriers, and its performance agrees with our Finite Element model predictions. A very important and beneficial property of our technology is its scalability. It can be tailored to attenuate sounds over the whole acoustic (and indeed ultrasonic) range. This means that it can readily be adapted to suit a wide range of applications. We have identified 2 key markets where legislation requires improved protection from sound pollution in the near future, namely:i) environmental noise from rail/roads and ii) protection from noisy machineryOur first aim is to extend our current models to full-scale simulations involving larger attenuators and realistic simulations of noise pollution. Having optimized the protection systems required for our two identified key markets we intend to build and test a full-scale demountable prototype for demonstration to potential industrial partners. This will be a system designed for protection from machinery noise since size and portability will be required. If time allows it is intended to construct a short section, modular construction barrier for use in road sound attenuation.In laboratory conditions our system offers good attenuation levels beating a mass law comparison. Initial research shows that the sound attenuation mechanism is virtually material independent, and poses a further advantage of blocking out low frequency sound without the need of increasing the mass of the barrier as with current technology (in current systems blocking low frequencies requires massive barriers). A successful outcome will lead to sound attenuation systems with wide applications throughout industry which offer major advantages over conventional systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project builds on work from EPSRC grant EP/F005482/1 whose main research theme is terahertz radiation emitters, filters etc. based on metamaterials and similar spatially modulated materials consisting of resonators. During the modelling work on the project, it was found that an array of acoustic resonators may control sound in a way similar to that in which electromagnetic resonators control, emit and receive THz radiation. We aim to construct acoustic barriers using these acoustic resonators. The key potential impacts of our noise barrier technology will be major new business opportunities, enhancement of competitiveness and the opening of new markets by having a worldwide technological lead. Two keys areas, road/rail noise attenuation in built up areas and attenuation of noise from machinery, have been identified as targets for the new technology. The pre-cast concrete industries, for example, could benefit from a market lead in new noise barrier materials and processes that will substantially reduce material/maintenance costs. British Precast and Tarmac ltd have already expressed an interest in working to evaluate the new technology. This will enhance the competitiveness of the UK. New noise barrier markets will create new jobs, both in the supplier and from new export markets for the UK economy. European Noise Legislation requires each member state to prepare noise maps of larger towns and cities, and to publish action plans that identify noise standards and set out programmes to reduce levels to these standards. A follow on regulation to the Environment Noise (England) regulations, 2006 requires further reductions in noise limits to take effect from 2016. Our technology gives an ideal solution for national governments to confirm to these noise legislations. When full scale prototypes have been successfully realised and tested, key government stakeholders such as the Highways Agency and the Department for Transport will see major benefits. There will be significant potential impact from the substantial reduction of environmental noise. Interest could translate very quickly into active support for commercialising this technology. Tarmac ltd are very well placed as they work closely with both the end user for noise barrier technology i.e. Highways Agency, and to the supplier market, as they are the leading construction material supplier in the UK. The overall benefits of our technology and reduced noise levels are obvious as noise effects are both health and behavioural. Noise pollution can cause annoyance and aggression, hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects. The costs to society of noise were estimated at 42 billion euros per year for EU-15, economic benefits from the reduce health costs are estimated to be 25 euros per household/decibel/year. Noise barrier projects in Europe have suggested that noise barriers can be integrated into the environment and have the potential to reflect current architectural trends. Construction of noise barriers not only benefits the end user, but also benefits, acoustic specialists, architects, construction workers, manufacturers of barrier elements, contractors, installation companies and governments. We plan to maximise potential impacts by: 1. Establishing and maintaining collaborations with developers of noise barrier technology in the UK. 2. The proactive participation of the LU Enterprise Office and our commercial champion to ensure that maximum industry and collaborator involvement is maintained throughout the project. 3. We aim to continue our presentations with industry and policy maker involvement (particularly the Highways Agency) 4. Communicating the results of our work via scientific publications, disseminating our results at international conference presentations, seminars, and discussion meetings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>167749</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>69450</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Loughborough University</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Loughborough University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Knowledge Transfer Account - exploitation</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>74B6612F-7DC5-4EC9-856F-3262CEAC93B7</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>83000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Engineering Enterprise Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7D1CB79A-B6B8-4E11-A4E1-B5B6610487B9</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Across Europe, attention is turning to noise pollution and the detrimental impacts it has on the population. Noise pollution has a wide range of costs including loss of amenity, adverse health impacts, and slower learning rates in children, irritation and effects on local ecology. In response to these considerations there has been a significant movement across the EU towards systematically managing noise.



Work at Loughborough University based on a Novel Noise Barrier Technology enables, in a cost effective and less intrusive manner, sound attenuation systems to be deployed along noisy transport links and around machinery. The barriers are comprised of a series of attenuators, precisely arranged to most effectively destroy sound waves in a specific environment. Additionally these barriers allows light and air to permeate, thus enabling air cooling of machinery enclosed within the barrier to take place and, for road and rail applications, facilitating drainage. They use typically less than 20% of the material required for a solid barrier, significantly reducing costs.



The barriers can be constructed from a wide variety of materials, without compromising performance as the technology is virtually material independent. It can be tailored to an optimal frequency attenuation range, specific to application, and the bandwidth can be increased to attenuate broad frequency ranges. They can compete with mass based sound screens with the advantage of less volume and weight.



This innovative sound barrier technology has been pioneered through a new area of physics called Sonic Crystals - a periodic array of wave scatterers which demonstrates severe and possibly total reduction of sound waves in specific frequency ranges. The ability for a sonic crystal to manipulate sound can be found in the interference of sound waves as they are scattered by the components. Because of the periodic nature this interference is constructive or destructive interference, dependant on the frequency of the incoming sound wave. Constructive interference occurs when the spacing of the crystal a, is comparable to the wavelength, lambda of the incoming sound. This means that our technology can be tailored to attenuate noise in any frequency range by adjusting the crystal's parameters. The novelty of our technology is that we replace the scatterers with multiple, frequency specific, attenuators to gain additional performance over conventional sonic crystals. This incorporates an additional attenuation mechanism of resonance to block out an increased range of frequencies related to the dimensions of the resonators, not the spacing between them.



The purpose of the grant was to develop and test prototypes of this novel noise barrier technology and to identify commercial partners and a viable market for it's exploitation. Prototypes are currently in place and undergoing evaluation at an Alkane energy sites in the East Midlands and an AV access rail depot installation in Derby. Initial results are very encouraging and negotiations are currently under way as to the best means of exploitation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is envisaged that benefit from the proposed research will mainly be concentrated in the areas of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Acoustics. Knowledge of resonators for sound attenuation and the potential use of sonic crystals in this regard are not new but the concept of designing and using multiply resonant oscillators as acoustic barriers is new. The results of the proposed research should prove very useful to Civil Engineers seeking to provide buildings with protection from ambient external noise and to those working in the area of noise protection in general.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5925FE0C-C762-40A5-87A4-8104629198E0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Environment,Healthcare,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sonobex.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/892E89FD-25B8-4B93-BC78-A827DBF38C4D"><gtr:id>892E89FD-25B8-4B93-BC78-A827DBF38C4D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comsol Conference, Stuttgart, Germany, (Oct 2011)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1f990a64785114b1fba9e07c5e48153c"><gtr:id>1f990a64785114b1fba9e07c5e48153c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Daniel Elford (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/85F49340-0734-4B2F-97C5-A79F88EB228D"><gtr:id>85F49340-0734-4B2F-97C5-A79F88EB228D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Matryoshka locally resonant sonic crystal.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f31b862717f1a632e059ba927c1c68eb"><gtr:id>f31b862717f1a632e059ba927c1c68eb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Elford DP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-4966</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/644B07D1-25D5-40B2-9270-1C61DF3D1B6C"><gtr:id>644B07D1-25D5-40B2-9270-1C61DF3D1B6C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Matryoshka locally resonant sonic crystal.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f31b862717f1a632e059ba927c1c68eb"><gtr:id>f31b862717f1a632e059ba927c1c68eb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Elford DP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-4966</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I029001/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B148AA4C-48F9-4B18-90F6-641750F725A1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Acoustics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
