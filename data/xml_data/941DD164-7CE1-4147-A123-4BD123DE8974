&lt;p>Qualitative data will be collected to shed light on a significant social (and spatial) problem and help us understand more about the nature of missing experiences. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The purpose of such an endeavour is to understand more about how people go missing and how the police and families respond to such events (the geographies of searching). Such a focus holds value for both the police and families (the 'left behind') in that it updates and checks current knowledge about the likely spatial experiences of missing people (where they go, how far they get, how they are sometimes relocated for significant periods of time). &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Using police-based time frames, we will compare a range of experiences of short-term (below 14 days) and long-term (over 14 days) missing people, to find out more about how going missing involves different sorts of journeys, different critical uses of space and place, which in turn hold different implications for the identities of those missing. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>420485</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This story is comprised from a narrative interview with people who have been reported as missing and who have returned.

In 2016-17 Hester has sat on a special Advisory Group for the Scottish Government for Return Home Interviews. She has also co-convened 2 national workshops on 'Return of Missing Persons' drawing on high level sector professionals. She will co-fund the launch of the Missing Persons Framework for Scotland in 2017 with the Scottish Government and co-ordinate a launch event.

Our research project has been awarded the ESRC prize for Outstanding Impact on Society for the 2015 impact prize.

Our research project contributed a new and unique resource to police and charity partners in that we were the first international team to recruit and interview returned missing persons. The additional qualitative data collection with police officers, case reconstructions, charity workers and families have revealed important learning points which have been taken up enthusiastically by these groups.

National policy and practice

? The research led to change in the draft UK APP - the new draft (2014-15) Authorised Professional Practice - due to be published by the College of Policing (www.college.police.uk) - comprises operational guidance for all police officers in England and Wales and this has incorporated draft recommendations from the project research directly relating to the experience of families of missing people in section 4.5.1 Police actions in relation to support for families, which highlights good practice. This includes specific links to the research outputs and alerts all officers to the relevant research reports. This will reach all officers in England and Wales who consult the APP.

? The research led to direct changes in Police Scotland's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP, issued 2014). The ESRC reports and recommendations have directly influenced the Standard Operational Guidance (SOP) launched in October 2014 (sections 16 and 19) issued to 13-14000 staff. These sections relate to 'Family Partnership' and 'Management of the Return' where Police Scotland have requested that return interviews take place. In addition there is included a new section on good practice family liaison work.

? Hester and Penny's membership of the Scottish Government led Working Group on National Missing Persons Strategy for Scotland 2014-15. The strategy is designed to focus on creating a framework for partnership agreements between Police Scotland (the new Missing Persons Unit) and agencies responsible for children who go missing from care, dementia suffers from care homes and NHS patients going missing from hospital. Hester's role is to bring a research perspective and remind agencies to keep a wider perspective on missing adults not captured by these services. The aim of the strategy is to take a preventative approach to missing and enables joints responses to missing people. The working group is over-lapping with a steering group to achieve effective national strategy. There will be a formal consultation in 2015 with a launch for stakeholders.

Building on 19 police knowledge exchange events in the UK, EU and US during the life of the project the following legacy is in place and evolving:

? A Knowledge Exchange Agreement between Glasgow University and the UK College of Policing facilitated the impact legacy of the research. The Agreement has a steering group who advised on the placement of the research in existing educational modules but for the purposes of update and enhancement. The modules are available to all police forces in England and Wales. Glasgow University invested &amp;pound;33,000 in a staff post (Stevenson) to enable this work, enhancing and extending the ESRC impact. Linked resources are now available to police officers in England and Wales in courses attracting over 36,000 officers (1 in 4) in the last 3 years.

? We have a branded competent of the CPD courses for POLSA (specialist search) officers with the UK Police National Search Centre (PNSC). We have delivered this to around 300 officers in 2014 and now the PSNC deliver our sessions with our resources to around 90 specialist officers per year in 3-4 courses. We evaluate the contribution at the time of delivery (see attached evaluation samples) and are beginning to follow-up with the officers who have undergone this training and education at 6 months intervals to understand more about the impact on working practices and professional change. We are following the research legacy and the impact. The input is designed to affect professional behavioural change around missing people and families.

? Police Scotland's Senior Investigative Officer Training (starting in 2015) at the Scottish Police College will now have a missing persons element led by Penny Woolnough and featuring project resources on families of missing people. 30 detectives take the 2 week training course (running approx 3 times per year at SPC) to become Senior Investigating Officers. This will be evaluated after course and after 6 months.

Our impact has been pronounced in policing communities where we have engaged in substantial knowledge exchange in police training fora (across the UK, EU and US). The team produced a key report and a resource that is being used by police officers across the UK.

In June 2015 the UKPMPB used the research to brief FCOs for good practice across Europe when dealing with British Nationals who have gone missing.

Policing knowledge exchange I: real-time delivery

The research team have presented at 19 major national UK police KE events since 2010 including to the Society of Evidence Based Policing and UK and EU FBI, and attendance has ranged from 10 to 200 police officers across the events. The research has helped create new EU KE networks amongst researchers of missing people and police via a project event in Brussels, May 2013 (30 attendees from 5 countries). The team have delivered a KE workshop in Washington, US in April, 2013 as part of an International Police and Justice Evidence Based Network and 200 attended this event (supported by the Scottish Government), as part of a new KE network with the Centre for Evidence-Based Crime Policy in George Mason University, Washington. The research findings were also launched at the first International Missing Persons Conference in 2013 via a keynote speech and official launch of the public resource 'Missing People: Missing Voices' (with a co-sponsored reception by the ESRC funding).

Highlights of these face to face impacts include a 'scenario' based case study resource workshop being delivered in July 2013 to 30 specialist POLSAR officers in training at the Police National Search Centre, Bramshill, Hampshire. The police evaluation of the use of this workshop was excellent.

Charity sector impacts:

Missing People Charity, support and public education: The GU team have delivered several workshops to the charity and co-funded the first ever family conference with the charity. 60 families of missing people came together for the first time to listen to research stories and discuss their common experiences. The GU team produced a key report on family interviews and the findings were used by the charity to help an application for funding to the Big Lottery - and this was successful. PI Hester Parr now serves on the advisory board for a new support service in Wales: 'Missing People Aftercare' that was launched with this funding.

Public impacts and engagement

The project has a well visited website www.geographiesofmissingpeople.org.uk has over 120,000 'real people' page hits since 2012 and this site carries 10 'stories of experience' in audio and text form for the purposes of public awareness. 

? The same resources are carried on the UK Missing People charity website: https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/about-us/about-the-issue/research/15-stories-of-missing-people.html

The PI and GU research fellow have now used 45 returned missing people's narratives to form 10 'stories of missing experience': 'Missing People: Missing Voice's' is an audio/text resource (read by actors) and provide a public awareness function for those interested in the experience of missing people.

Channel 4 screened a documentary, produced by RAW TV, who has liaised with the project team for a year for advice, contacts and guidance. 'The Missing' was screened in April, 2104 and reached 2.4 million people on a variety of C4 platforms.

'Missing People: Missing Voices' has been performed or played at a variety of public events, including the 2014 AHRC 'Being Human Festival'.

Public Awards: 

Nominated for 2015 ESRC Impact Awards for Outstanding Impact on Society.

The 'Geographies of Missing People' project has been awarded the 2013 Scottish Policing Award from the Scottish Government for 'Applied Policing Research'. This competitive award (from a shortlist of five selected national nominees) was handed to the team by the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, on Monday 11th March, 2013.

UK testimonial of national stakeholders:

'Until now no research or study has been available to help explain why adults go missing and to explore their experiences. This research report has an immediate relevance and utility in evidence-based operational practice. From a policing perspective, translating the learning from this research study into evidence-based practice and then synthesising it with other practice will lead to huge improvements in safeguarding our most vulnerable people. This is a research study of true value and importance and it is a pleasure to welcome and commend this work'.

 Joe Apps, Manger of the UK Missing Persons Bureau, National Crime Agency

 'I believe the work being done to really understand what happens when people go missing is crucial to improving the police response. Listening to a presentation on the findings so far made a huge impact on me and gave me a greater insight into the psyche of those who go missing, than anything I had experienced in the past 30 years. This work will provide a sound foundation for the future development of police tactics and indeed the way in which the public in general can better understand those who go missing' 

Chief Constable Pat Geenty, Wiltshire Constabulary and UK Police Lead for Missing Persons

The Missing People charity:

'Research is such a vital way to promote understanding and The Geographies of Missing People project has provided valuable insight into the experience of losing someone special, and living with this loss. I wholeheartedly welcome and commend this research. We are grateful to the families who took part in the research and for sharing something so personal for the benefit of others. This report, and its recommendations, will help all of us working with and supporting families of missing people by helping to ground us in the reality of how it feels to lose someone and not know where they are. I pledge that at Missing People we will hear the messages in this report from the families and work with its recommendations. We will embed these in our understanding, our practice, our communication and our development of services'. 

Jo Youle Chief Executive Missing People Charity 

'The stories launched in this project allow us to hear, for the first time, the voices of people who have been missing in the past. [T]hese are stories that we have to hear, and we have to share. We must learn from them. And we owe this team out thanks for bringing us these stories, as we owe our thanks to those people who bravely shared with them their most personal stories.' 

'When making a case for support to funders we need to provide evidence of need, and we have previously found it difficult to find information about the experiences of missing people (particularly adults) and their families. The important work of the Geographies of Missing People project has filled this gap. The research has also been a valuable independent endorsement of our work, while providing evidence for needed services developments. Our Partnerships team also regularly use the findings in presentations and in meetings to illustrate the issue.'
Lucy Homes, Research Manager, Missing People Charity

'I have seen this research have an impact on professionals' understanding of the mind-set and experiences of adults who are missing. I believe it has commenced a change in attitude towards adults whose behaviours while missing now have more limelight than previously. This research has created a framework through which police can discuss how adults behave and think'. 

Missing People's Head of Partnerships and Development 

Police Scotland:

'The main report of the Geographies of missing people has been particularly useful to Police Scotland as this provides an insight into the feelings, emotions, expectations and ultimately the journey of the missing person.

This research has allowed Police Scotland to view missing person investigations from a different perspective, and the recommendations provided will be introduced so to improve service delivery. These recommendations given by the research will be incorporated into policy guidance (SOP) and also operational guidance (training and aide memoire).

The significant changes which have come as a result of the study are those which have already been mentioned; the use of positive and reassuring language with the family, the sign posting towards support the need to conduct return interviews in the right circumstances and for officers to be mindful of their conduct during such interviews. 

 It is recognised that making these changes should improve service delivery and will assist in gaining support from the family during the investigation and also from the missing person upon their return.'

This has been an internationally unique research project - the first we know of that has recruited returned missing persons for in-depth interview focussing on their missing journeys.

By speaking to 45 such people we have filled in the gaps of police knowledge and research and aided their understanding of missing persons. Significant findings include that people do not always know they are missing or what this means; that missing people stay local to points of departure; that return interviews and after-journey talking is critically important to this group and that they lack the opportunity to do so. These findings have been extensively reported to and used by police knowledge-exchange forums and in education and training modules. The research has made a difference to how key figures in UK national policing bodies and Police Scotland think about and act on missing persons enquiries.

Interviews with 25 families of missing people have revealed new evidence of both good and poor police practice in the handling of missing persons cases and family liaison. This has been brought into focus in hard-hitting research reports which have resulted in the findings being included in new police guidance in introduced by Police Scotland in 2014. The Missing People charity has acted on the findings to apply (successfully) for Big Lottery Funding to provide a new aftercare service in Wales. We collaborated with the Missing People charity to bring together 60 families of missing people to hear the research results and share experiences with each other. The charity has committed to using the findings to inform their service development in the future.

23 interviews with police officers and analysis of 12 police case files revealed that responding to reports of missing persons represents one of the biggest demands on the resources of police organisations. The research provided insights into the different stages of the investigative process and some of the key influences which shaped the trajectory of a missing person's investigation. In particular, it highlighted how officers understand and construct investigations, which are often shaped by a mix of police craft, 'science' and 'reputational' issues. These findings have contributed new knowledge to police research.

The interviews with returned missing people and family members have resulted in research findings that have been taken up into new national guidance for police officers in Scotland and have been included in updated training modules by the UK National Police College. 2 members of the research team now sit on a National policy working group in Scotland and are part of a team creating a new strategy for missing people, led by the Scottish Government.

The research was awarded a special category award in the 2013 Scottish Policing Awards for excellence in 'Applied Policing Research'. The presentation was made Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, on Monday 11th March, 2013.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Professional and charitable communities are using the research findings and creative-artistic products to improve education and training provision in the area of missing persons. We are actively shaping these contributions in new collaborative partnerships eg with the Police National Search Centre and the UK National Police College.

The stories of missing people are being used in public (via web and event dissemination) to raise awareness amongst the public about missing people and the experiences they have. 

2 members of the research sits on a National Strategy Working Group for Missing Persons, led by the Scottish Government and here we are pushing for further public education and awareness raising, based on our findings. Police Scotland has also changed its guidance to 14000 officers, based on our research findings.

We have contributed the production of a Channel 4 documentary on Missing People by providing expert guidance and background information. This documentary reached 2.4 million people in April 2014.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4C6E6FCC-75F8-44C3-92F1-C0ED9AAA7728</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.geographiesofmissingpeople.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of Government led National Missing Persons Strategy Group (Scotland)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>44BCDF36-5F54-4CE7-9A47-58C050FA92FF</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guidance committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Input to police training (live and on-line)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3250A558-F0FA-4A45-A67E-F3EC896ABED7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Between 2011 and 2013 we delivered 15 face-to-face knowledge exchange seminars or workshops to police and charitable stakeholders in the UK, EU and US reaching around 500 police officers across the events and 100 NGO workers and 60 families of missing people. We evaluated those events that were specifically part of formal training for serving police officers and received excellent evaluation indicating how our research-led workshops would change or influence future individual policing practice.

In 2014 we began a collaborative agreement - funded by the Glasgow University Knowledge Exchange Fund - with the UK College of Policing and the Police National Search Centre. We have updated several modules that the police college officers its officers in terms of on-line training and education with regards to missing persons. The modules we offered updates on are listed below (with previous figures representing uptake up to 2014). This indicates the potential reach. We are currently waiting for the Police College to make the changes to the on-line modules and deliver on their agreement with us to do so. We have been assured by email from the Director that this is in process.

Missing Persons E-Briefing 704
Public Protection - Missing Daughter 6,022

We have also contribute to live CPD events in 3 locations (with officer numbers and impact evaluation completed)
'Police Search Advisor CPD, (14 - 15th April, 2014, Ryton). reaching 118 delegates, in total 116 evaluations 
Police Search Advisor CPD, (22 - 23rd April, 2014, Tulliallan) reaching 50 delegates, in total 47 evaluations 
Police Search Advisor CPD, (7th - 8th May, 2014, Bramshill) reaching 92 delegates, in total 82 evaluations

There is now an active process in place for the Police National Search Centre to deliver our research workshop based on the findings, and organise officer evaluation. This is successfully happening during 2014. The courses are delivered quarterly and reach around 90 specialist search officers per year. The evaluations ask for self-reported comment on predicated professional behaviour change as a result of exposure to the workshop, and indicative evaluation show that empathetic professional behaviours to both families of missing people and returning missing people are resulting from this knowledge exchange.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of Government Advisory Group on Return Homes Interviews</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AEA573EB-12AF-4D53-B6F0-19192084435F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Guidance will be launched in 2017 - as part of the Framework for Missing Persons in Scotland.
