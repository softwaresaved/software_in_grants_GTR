Many projects in Systems Biology have been funded worldwide. However, it is often not clear how the results are made available to further research. Some result data sets or models are stored in public resources, but not all. Other repositories are ripe for a greater exploitation world-wide. Funding agencies now expect new projects to publish their results using open access and to provide a data management and data sustainability plan to assure that their investment has the desired impact. However, the researchers often have neither the means nor the knowledge necessary to publish and maintain their results according to the necessary standards so that they remain available beyond the end of their project. The results as requested by the publishers are often insufficient to be able to reliably reproduce results. Models and standard operating procedures are often not available or are not sufficiently described to be reproducible. This introduces inefficiencies, as the limited reusability and impact of project results on future projects leads to reinventions of methods and tools and slows the pace of scientific progress. 

Systems Biology projects often have large and heterogeneous data sets, always have mathematical models based on experimental data. Such projects usually have researchers from various disciplines at many locations collaborating, where direct communication is often difficult not just because of the locality but also due to different semantics among disciplines. A shared software interface with transparent data and links to models is essential to allow for interdisciplinary research and to interact among research groups in Systems Biology. The iterative cycle between experiment and models that is typical in System Biology projects, mandates a good versioning system for experiment and model versions as well as investigation-study organisational structures such that the project workflow is clear and reproducible. Furthermore, a strict adherence to community standards and standard operating procedures is important for linking data and models created by different project members. A management platform needs to support experimental workflows and model and data linkages, with good tools for data and model annotation and adherence to standard formats of representation. In order to have all the information for a reproducible scientific process, data for model construction and model validation need to be clearly separated and all data, models and Standard Operating Procedures must be made available for download. Dedicated software platforms and tools are necessary to lift scientific research in Systems Biology up to industrial standards of reproducibility and quality control. 

In this project we will establish a sustainable European data and model e-infrastructure for the European systems biology community with a long-term business model. We will found a European wide Data &amp;amp; Model Management Network to support and promote data and model management and capacity building, using the EraSysAPP ERANet as a seed. We will disseminate knowledge and standards, coordinating with related e-infrastructures such as ELIXIR and ISBE, and interacting with community related policy and standards settings. We will develop the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for Systems Biology projects by combining and further developing/improving the well-proven software platforms SEEK and openBIS with a pool of public tools and resources, working closely with both the user and the developer communities. Finally, we will establish a sustainable training programming on the use and development of the platform and on data/model management practices for Systems Biology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In the course of the ERA-Net EraSysAPP and European research infrastructure project ISBE, three national funding agencies have agreed to support a Data and Model Management Core Project - DMMCore - for the European life science research community. This joint action aims at establishing an internationally sustained Data and Model Management service to the European systems biology community seeded by research projects funded by ERASysAPP. Previous funding programs (SysMO and SystemsX.ch) dedicated support projects (SysMO-DB and SyBIT) have been set up to create the necessary tools and resources, and to interact with the research projects to assure proper data and model management. We are building on the experience and expertise of those projects to:
1) Develop a standards-based Data and Model Management Platform by combining the openBIS and SEEK platforms (openSEEK) with a Core Tool Pool of community software and archives. 
2) Establish a sustainable European infrastructure using the platform, including a community Facility called EuroSEEK to host projects that do not want to operate their own local openSEEK platform. We will establish a Data &amp;amp; Model Management Network of community actions of experts, users and developers, sustainability mechanisms for the EuroSEEK Facility that federates national activities in countries in addition to the DMMCore countries; and a SysBioDMM Foundation to manage future membership funding of the resources and the community networks. We will actively engage in standards and work with standards and policy setting organisations.
3) Provide support and operations for the EraSysAPP projects seeding the European Infrastructure including: support for projects to found their local data management solution based on openSEEK and project-specific data analysis pipelines; a Support Team for technical curation, policy making, advice and training; and a PALs focus group of project representatives to work with the delivery team.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Systems approaches to biology have the potential to transform biology and medicine and provide economic benefits through, for example, industrial biotechnology amd applications that detect drug project failure earlier and speed up therapeutic development: it is estimated that drug discovery costs could be reduced by $390m (&amp;pound;225m) development time to market shortened by three years (Strategy for UK Life Sciences, BIS). The UK alone has more than 50+ research groups and has invested &amp;pound;300m in awards, with an expectation of greater investment. 

This project proposes to raise the capacity and capability of Systems Biology asset management by establishing a management platform for data, models and SOPs, enabling access to and management of results, radically improving the availability of the results and raising the quality of metadata practices. Thus the project has the potential to produce impact across Systems Biology and its application, and across a broad range of the life sciences through better management, quality control, and adherence to standards leading to greater reproducibility and reusability of models and data. 

Our work plan makes a direct contribution towards making the widest possible economic and societal impact of Systems Biology , with dedicated programmes of community engagement and outreach. Specific impacts include:
- An off-the-shelf management platform (openSEEK) for European researchers exploiting prior developments. We have the potential to be the management system for SysBio projects worldwide. The platform has already made an impact internationally with instances in Europe, Russia and South America.
- A EuroSEEK hosted resource built using openSEEK to retain, find, track, and share European research results, thereby ensure a greater impact of Europe's research programmes internationally and to business, and facilitating data and knowledge exchange between researchers. 
- Raised accessibility and profile of European software and data invesents through their integration into the pan-European resource and training programme.
- An established Data and Model Management Facility Network of European Centres using: openSEEK as the flagship platform; EuroSEEK as a directory of researchers and research; and centre members as skilled data stewards. The network will bootstrap a European Research Infrastructure.
- Adoption of the platform, resources and practices by developing a Knowledge Network of early and mid-career researchers, User and Developer Forums and a Systems Biology Developers Foundry. 
- Raised capacity through a training programme with bootcamps, workshops etc, through partnerships with organisations like Software Carpentry and GOBLET.
- Partnerships with scholarly communication stakeholders (publishers and open access repositories) to improve data and model publishing, incentivize researchers and yield better management practices.
- Active participation and leadership in domain specific standards bodies (e.g. COMBINE), selected communities (e.g. Research Data Alliance, BioSharing), and adaptation of our platforms and training to emerging standards and selected Research Infrastructures (e.g. ISBE, ELIXIR,EUDAT).

The greatest challenge to impact is sustaining the DMMCore outcomes and activities for the long term. We will work with funding agencies and the community to develop funding models, infrastructure support policies and contribution mechanisms. We will work with the UK's Software Sustainability Institute on sustainability strategies for the software and software training, and establish a not for profit Foundation as a focus for funding, running the EuroSEEK facility and open source software development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1015804</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Rostock</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Rostock</gtr:description><gtr:id>5A0B74E4-2614-45CF-8506-EB557DDFCFA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CombineArchive with Research Objects https://sems.uni-rostock.de/2015/09/webcat-exports-research-objects/

FAIR stands for &amp;quot;Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable&amp;quot;. FAIRDOM stands for &amp;quot;FAIR Data, sOps, Models&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;FAIR sharing and credit&amp;quot; between researchers. 
The BBSRC grant is part of a multi-award programme with BMBF (Germany) and SystemX (Switzerland). We work closely with these partners as a joint delivery team.

The project has four major aspects:
1. The FAIRDOM Open Software Platform for data and model management (a development of the open source SEEK previously developed by the SysMO-DB1 and SysMO-DB2 projects). An open source development community is being developed around the software. The Platform can be downloaded, installed and managed independently by researchers for their own customised needs.

34 EU projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub. These include all the projects of the ERANets SysMO and ERASysAPP programme as well as projects from the German Bioinformatics Infrastructure de.NBI and independent projects such as the GenoSysFat from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. 
387 users are registered with over 2000 assets.
50% of SysMO-DB projects are still actively posting content many years after end of that programme.

Since January 2016 the software supports independent researchers outside of managed programmes.

2. The FAIRDOMHub public data and model management &amp;quot;Commons&amp;quot; resource based on the Platform. 
21 free-standing SEEK installations are known. Highlights include take-up by: Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility (800 scientists, 1500 instruments) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA; the de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network; two UK Synthetic Biology Centres (SynBioChem and SynthSys); and the DigiSal Norwegian National Project. It has been adopted by large EU consortia (NMTrypl, EmPowerPutid, Mycosynvac) and the German Virtual Liver Network as well as its follow on LiSyM (Liver System Medicine). 

Since January 2016 the Hub supports independent, self-managing projects.

3. The FAIRDOM Services for business analysis and stewardship advice, installation support and hosting, stewardship training, curation support, best practices and standards watch, and trouble shooting.

We balance support for immediate users, investment in bigger users, and the building of the materials that make data management more accessible independently. We are building up a portfolio of projects through: 
? &amp;quot;pre-sales&amp;quot; consultations with strategic projects
? National and Community networks 
? National infrastructures and Centres.

We extended our reach to Synthetic Biology (supporting two Syn Bio Projects in the UK) and are extending to Virtual Physiology and Systems Medicine through new projects. 

We are developing a pilot FAIRDOMHub as a &amp;quot;publisher companion&amp;quot; for manuscripts with mathematical models and/or experimental data, first with those who collaborate with JWS Online's curation services: FEBSJ has already accepted two publications in which we link data and models to the Hub, using DOIs. 

With the European RI ISBE we conducted a community survey in availability and usage of standards, and general data management practices. We have summarised the key findings and published a commentary paper.

We have pioneered the reproducibility of Systems Biology models with the development of the Research Objects packaging and support for the COMBINE Archive file format, model simulation and versioning.

4. The FAIRDOM Community of researchers and developers skilled in stewardship and tool-making, standards, and other stakeholders: publishers, funders and other RIs.
We currently have 11 active collaborations. We have developed a Knowledge Hub of materials, guides; useful sites; data management checklists ; community standards; repositories and commons; specialised software; publications; webinars; reports; presentations; tutorials. A video to promote data stewardship has been completed and we have launched a webinar series in 2016. 
We run two community clubs
? The Samples Club (with RIs BBMRI-ERIC, ISBE and ELIXIR).
? The SysBio Developers Foundry which brings together developers working in the systems and synthetic biology communities. 

FAIRDOMHub Yellow Pages is a &amp;quot;Peoples Commons&amp;quot; with 500+ individuals' profiles that we can develop and exploit. FAIRDOMHub now supports registration of independent individuals. In 2016 we will link with Orcid and LinkedIn profiles, run a &amp;quot;Curate your Profile&amp;quot; campaign, better couple Hub Yellow Pages with the web site. We are working with the ISBE Research Infrastructure Community site and the ISBE web site teams to create a seamless online community presence.

Beyond Systems Biology the platform has been adopted by the EU Biodiversity Portal BioVeL and Manchester's Web Ergonomics Lab.

5. EU RI Impact
Interactions with funding agencies and ESFRI Research Infrastructure include contributions to policy and stewardship advocacy in EU RIs, national councils (SynBio Leadership Council Roadmap) EU initiatives (e.g. ScienceEurope, European Open Science Cloud) and international initiatives (Force11/BD2K DCIP). 
? FAIRDOM is adopted as a core component of the interim phase ISBE Light and leads the stewardship pillar. We authored the ISBE data management strategy and recommendations and serve on the ISBE Light Steering Committee. We represent ISBE at international meetings and are working with the Intergovernmental Working Group to secure sustainability.
? FAIRDOM members have leadership roles in ELIXIR - participating in two major awards: ELIXIR-EXCELERATE and CORBEL. FAIRDOM Services are featured in CORBEL. HITS is a member of de.NBI , the German Bioinformatics Network, which potentially strengthens links with ELIXIR. We do not see much prospect of direct funding from ELIXIR. 
? ERASysAPP we co-authored the ERASysAPP SRA and the data management plan and advised on the follow-on proposal EU Cofund CoBiTe. 

We are establishing a not for profit Foundation for the sustainability of FAIRDOM with Facilities in the USA, UK, Norway, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and potential facilities in Sweden and the Czech Republic.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>372A3EEA-20FA-4743-A8C9-A919B208AF05</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have six major findings:

1. The FAIRDOM SEEK Open Software Platform, pluggable with a Core Pool of specialist software (JWS Online, LabArchives, BioVis, Cytoscape etc), specialist public archives (PubMed, Biomodels etc) and general purpose public archives (e.g. Zenodo, Figshare). An open source development community is being developed around the SEEK software. The Platform can be downloaded, installed and managed independently by researchers for their own customised needs.
The platform supports data from instruments (using our partner's openBIS software) to web-based cross-repository cataloging (using our SEEK software), metadata collection (using our RightField software) and model simulation (using our partner's JWS Online Software).

The platform has been independently installed by over 30 groups and projects in Europe, the USA, Russia, South Africa and the UK. 

2. The FAIRDOMHub is a public data and model management &amp;quot;Commons&amp;quot; resource for projects, based on the SEEK Software Platform. 
A project &amp;quot;Commons&amp;quot; is a key recommendation of the EU ISBE Research Infrastructure. The ERASysAPP, ERASysBIO and SysMO ERANet projects have been consolidated as areas on the FAIRDOMHub, and in January 2016 the Hub was updated to support self-managing independent projects. Currently 58 projects have self-managed spaces on the Hub for managing their research assets either whilst working on them or at the point of publishing. over 700 researchers are registered in the Hub's Yellow Pages from over 190 institutions. 

3. The FAIRDOM Services of business analysis and stewardship advice, installation support and hosting, stewardship training, curation support, best practices and standards watch, and trouble shooting. Services are tiered to range from premium and super premium levels, funded support of specific initiatives and projects such as EU ERANET ERASysAPP to standard level support of independent users through forums and online resources. FAIRDOM aims to establish and facility network of affiliates capable of offering FAIRDOM services, working with funders to achieve this through the FAIRDOM Association.

4. The FAIRDOM Community is a community of researchers and developers skilled in asset stewardship or tool-making, and engaging with communities important to Sys and Syn Bio researchers such as standards (e.g. COMBINE), publishers, funders and other RIs. Activities include face to face meetings and webinars; summer schools and specialist workshops; a BioSamples Club; a SysBio software developers foundry; VIP users (the PALS); and establishing an online hub through the FAIRDOM web site and the FAIRDOMHub &amp;quot;yellow pages&amp;quot; people commons. The team partner with training providers such as Software and Data Carpentry and community networks such as COMBINE, CaSyM, MultiScale Biology Network and GARNet.

5. EU Research Infrastructures - we have developed policy for data stewardship for the EU RI ISBE, and FAIRDOM is now the core data stewardship pillar for ISBE Interim Phase. We also developed stewardship policy for ERANet ERASysAPP programme. We work closely with ELIXIR RI and the VPH Institute. 

6. The FAIRDOM Association e.V., is a legally registered Not Profit Organisation (NPO) Association to further the aims of FAIRDOM and support its products, services and activities, able to have its own employees and able to win and distribute funds. On 12th December 2016 the Association was incorporated in front of a notary in Berlin. A founding member is Professor Andrew Millar (Director of the SynthSys Centre at the University of Edinburgh) who is not funded by the DMMCore award. Having a legal entity has already attracted interests through funding councils (ERACofund CoBioTech) and RIs (ISBE and ELIXIR-Norway). The next steps are to: fully establish the Associations' procedures and in particular its financial regulations; signup institutional members who are on the runway; set up the Linked Third Party Agreement (Art. 14, AMGA) and start operation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The whole point of the project is a public and open source infrastructure and the associated stewardship services to support Systems Biology projects with their data and model management allowing for intensive community engagement, training, advice and support services. Thus the project is all about the use of the platforms, the Hub Commons, know-how and the building of user, collaborator and developer communities. We have established the FAIRDOM Association e.V. which aims to be a member-serving and community-serving organisation.
? Member-serving organizations - benefit a particular group of people i.e. its members; we think of ourselves as a cooperative or a knowledge network of excellence. 
? Community-serving organizations - provide services to the community in general, globally and locally, perhaps at a beneficial level to its members; we think of ourselves as a start-up company.
We only recently incorporated. The next year we will build up the Association.

All the software is open source, with an open developer community. The FAIRDOMHub is a free public Commons resource hosted and guaranteed until 2019, and we are building a Facility Network and Knowledge Hub to support the Commons through partnerships and membership of the FAIRDOM Association e.V.

This project includes establishing a sustainable European infrastructure to extend the network services to the wider European systems biology community and seed a European wide Data and Model Management Network to support and promote data and model management and capacity building, disseminating knowledge and standards, coordinating with related e-infrastructures such as ELIXIR and ISBE, and interacting with community related policy and standards settings. 

This also means developing the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for Systems Biology projects working closely with both the user and the developer communities. 

We also document and disseminate the outcomes and activities especially to funding agencies, projects and centres, assuring the success of the sustainable business model and funding models for the long term. Provide training in the usage of the tools and platform, as well as in its operations and further development.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7960AEA7-A8C2-407C-8A04-7FEC37009585</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.fair-dom.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>ERACoBioTech Data Management Planning</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B570D03-591A-452F-8A56-E6D01A784A24</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.cobiotech.eu/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EU's Targeted Stakeholders' Consultation on Long Term Sustainability of Research Infrastructures (January 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CCC52AB3-2F27-4261-B22D-5E2AF78CA56F</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Science Europe</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DE295F21-673B-4917-A2EC-62CE44514D35</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The former Science Europe Scientific Committee for the Life, Environmental and Geo Sciences organised a workshop in Brussels on 1 and 2 December 2015. Representatives from Science Europe Member Organisations (both research funding and research performing organisations), the publishing community, various research organisations and universities, evaluators and researchers, were invited to share their diverse perspectives and to brainstorm the issue.

The 'state of the art' in terms of crediting multidisciplinary research, the needs of various stakeholders, solutions, bottlenecks and recommendations for funders, researchers, policy makers and publishers were discussed in-depth. It was universally agreed that systems such as crediting appropriately, supporting data re-use and rewarding multidisciplinary science need updating. There is a need to determine standardised criteria for evaluating multidisciplinary science, and a need to apply them successfully in evaluation panels and in recruitment. In order to achieve this, guidelines should be provided for researchers, funders, evaluation panels and publishers on how to credit and to cite 
specific contributions, data, tools and software in an improved way. Data and tools were especially highlighted; informal mentions of software and datasets should end and proper citation should be used in the future. Individual researchers should take steps themselves to ensure that they highlight all of their contributions. In addition to the typical peer-reviewed publications, researchers should disseminate their 'other research outputs', such as collaborative work, shared data, new methods or 
techniques, software, media outputs and other such contributions. These should in turn be evaluated along with the traditional outputs. 
The full list of recommendations are listed at the end of the report, and include further suggestions about how to more accurately credit and better evaluate multidisciplinary research. Some of the promising new tools and methods being developed, were presented and discussed. The benefits of applying new methods for assessing the specific contributions of researchers and accurately awarding them for their scholarly input to the data-driven multidisciplinary research of the current and future scientific 
landscape would be wide-ranging. Collectively, such new approaches will foster multidisciplinary science and support research-driven innovation.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.scienceeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SE_LEGS_Careerpaths_Workshop_Report.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>ERASysAPP Strategic Research Agenda - Systems Biology in Europe 2016</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36D1EBF4-CEFD-4D11-9F9F-D1B97B2BAD82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Strategic Research Agenda - Systems Biology in Europe 2016 addresses five key issues.

Construct your own model
With the new JWS Online model builder you can build a model from scratch using a simple interface. Models can be simulated directly in the JWS Online simulator. The builder adheres very closely to the SBML model specification and supports the MIRIAM and SBO standards for annotation, and provides a useful online annotation tool.

Simulate models
Simulate curated kinetic models from the JWS Online database, or non-curated models built or uploaded to JWS Online. JWS Online supports time evolutions, steady-state simulations, structural analysis, metabolic-control analysis, parameter scans, and reaction plots.

SBML compliant
JWS Online now uses a database implementation with a native format that mirrors the SBML specification. This minimises changes in SBML structure during the upload-edit-save cycle. JWS Online supports uploading and modification of existing models in SBML or JWS format.

Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.
SEEK is incorporating semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FBD8A75D-2D18-4743-B496-DC7EE5660B18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The SEEK4Science platform was adopted by the all of the ERANet SysMO I and II projects it was designed for and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the German Virtual Liver Network and its follow-on Liver Systems Medicine project, ERANet's ERASysBio+ projects, and ERASysAPP. 
The Platform is now developed under the FAIRDOM Initiative (funded by the DMMCore project partners, including the BBSRC) http://www.fair-dom.org.

The software platform has been independently adopted by 30+ groups in Europe, Russia, South Africa, USA, and the UK. EU Projects that adopt the platform include: EmPowerPutida and Mycosynvac; national projects include the German Systems Medicine for Liver project and the de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network, and the Norway's Digital Life programme. The platform has been adopted by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA. Combined with the openBIS system, it is the platform for two UK Synthetic Biology Centre's data management (SynBioChem and SynthSys). 

58 projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub.org Commons, a centralised public community instance of the SEEK4Science Platform. 
Work on the SysMO-DB project and the SEEK directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE Light - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. 

The SEEK4Science software and associated software, FAIRDOMHub Commons and its support services form a core pillar of the ISBE Light Interim phase. 

Commercially, SEEK was the prototype component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's eaglecore platform and is currently being reviewed by 3 commercial organisations.

Practical evaluation of SEEK and openBIS for biological data management in SynthSys; first report (https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/12236) recommended the platform.

The SysMO-DB project also directly lead to the FAIRDOM project, a consortium of 4 EU funding councils to: Establish a sustainable European Infrastructure to extend the network services to the wider European systems biology community; Develop the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for systems biology project, building on SEEK and openBIS (SystemsX); and document and disseminate the outcomes and activities to funding agencies, projects and centres with the goal of establishing a sustainable business model for this infrastructure. 

FAIRDOM is funded by the UK through the BBSRC BB/M013189/1 DMMCore: Data and Model Management Core for ERASysAPP and Europe project.
