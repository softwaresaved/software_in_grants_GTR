As a method to solve disputes outside of the courts, ombudsman systems deal with many cases per year in both public and private sectors. Although originally established in the public sector, as a link between citizens and government institutions, the ombudsman model has, in many countries, now been adopted by the private sector too. 

The ombudsman landscape throughout EU member states presents a variety of institutional and jurisdictional arrangements, operational styles and decision-making processes. Although this poses some challenges in being able to conceptualise a unified ombudsman institution, it offers distinct advantages for the study of the relationship between decision-making practices on the part of ombudsmen and perceptions of procedural justice and levels of trust on the part of users across different jurisdictions and cultures. 

Despite the significance of ombudsmen to our constitutional and civil justice landscapes, very little is known about users' perceptions of the fairness of their procedures and practices and the significance of these perceptions for levels of trust in particular ombudsman offices. 
This project will fill this gap, providing important data and knowledge which will be directly relevant to the development of national policies and EU level multiple networks of policy-making.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Because the research addresses public attitudes to and use of ombudsmen, it will impact on and be pertinent to the public, to consumer groups, to ombudsmen, and to policy makers at national and EU level. Academic debate will be encouraged to engage in collaboration with practitioners and representatives of the public. This is very important for countries such as Germany and Greece where private sector ombudsmen are not noticeably established yet.

Academic impact

This project will contribute to further understanding of and advance the academic debate about the importance of the role of the Ombudsman and users' perceptions of the complaints process. It will create new datasets that the applicant will make available for further research in this area. 
This project will progress the applicants' career by providing an opportunity to share and disseminate the findings to a broad audience, enhancing the chance to become a future leader in this field of expertise.


Policy makers

EU level requirements for member states to have alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in place to ensure consumer protection (ADR directive and ODR regulation, proposed 2011, will be passed late 2012) are a high priority. Therefore, this proposed study will feed directly into the needed knowledge base about different ombudsman systems and their users.

Business 

This research is of benefit to business as it could help reduce costs associated with litigation, reduce potential reputational damage due to litigation, and provide a possible route through for their disputes with government and EU regulation. The applicant will elaborate on how these stakeholders will learn about this research in the impact plan.

Public

The public dissemination of the research will continue to inform public debate and awareness of how best to use an ombudsman. This will contribute to and improve conceptual impact as well as instrumental impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>43912</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My work changed the way that ombudsmen understand consumers and as a result have changed their approach to improve their services. 
BIS found that most consumers in the UK feel confident when purchasing goods and services, however it is estimated that a total of 18.7 million problems were experienced in 2014. The financial detriment in the UK population for consumer problems was over &amp;pound; 4.2 billion (2014). Despite the scale of this issue, pathways to resolve consumer complaints, outside of the courts, are under-researched.
For the past fifty years, Ombudsmen schemes have given consumers free, accessible and informal methods to resolve disputes with public bodies or businesses, but little attention has been paid to how the schemes themselves are experienced by consumers. My study achieved this and provides a source of benchmarking opportunities. My work is timely as EU- wide legislation on alternative dispute resolution (e.g. ombudsmen) was passed (2013) and implemented (2015) during my research, therefore it attracted a lot of interest from ombudsmen and policy makers. 

My ESRC FRL project on impact and legitimacy of ombudsmen in Europe (https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/trusting-middle-man-impact-and-legitimacy-ombudsmen-europe) allowed me to collect a unique and rich dataset of experiences of recent users of ombudsmen. I designed a consumer satisfaction survey to measure public trust in ombudsmen and received just under 3,000 responses. It is the first study that brought together 14 different ombudsman schemes consumers' complaints data. I engaged in continual knowledge exchange (focus groups, facilitated sessions) with ombudsmen and the public throughout the research process with the objective of sharing ideas, research evidence and skills that could be transferred into practical outputs. 
 
A real strength of my project has been the networks and collaboration between ombudsmen schemes, and across countries, that I built. I involved the ombudsmen in my study from the outset; this gave me exceptional access to gather data and improved not only my research and findings but also ensured future collaboration. Through meetings, workshops and conferences I extended networks of German ombudsmen: Prof Hirsch (insurance), Herr Kipp (energy), and engaged them in collaboration and exchange of best practice with their UK counterparts: Lewis Shand Smith (energy), Carolyn Wayman (finance), for the first time. As a result of ongoing collaboration, my research has had instrumental and capacity building impact with a range of organisations.

Utilising networks I have built, and the current strong appetite for evidence, my work has started to influence the development of policy and is altering behaviour. Through my research ombudsmen were able to better understand their consumers' needs and make changes to their service charters and procedures. My findings helped to address the misconception that most people complain because they want compensation; this supported the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) in encouraging local authorities to take a less defensive and adversarial approach to complaints. 

New European legislation requires ombudsmen to report their annual statistics; some ombudsmen did not have these measures in place and were keen to participate in my study. German ombudsmen decided to adopt my survey for their reporting requirements. I have also worked with them to develop resources and tools for use in practice and to improve the existing ones. Building capacity amongst staff in the Ombudsmen organisations has been crucial for progress to be made on improving customer service. The LGO and Ombudsman Services have applied my findings and used them to train their complaint-handling and management staff, with the aim of improving the consumer experience. 

I ran into unexpected challenges when collecting my data. Some of the ombudsmen tried to monitor and control the sample. My method relied upon keeping the anonymity of the subjects by asking ombudsmen (staff) to send out surveys to a random, representative sample. I managed to overcome this by communicating that their actions would bias my findings and I could not use them, if not collected properly.

My findings are published as open access reports on my project website and have had 951 downloads &amp;amp; visits. My work has influenced the discourse on complaint handling with practitioners through presentations at the Ombudsman Association (OA) and National Energy Ombudsman Network. Reaching out to this wide and diverse audience, my research on consumer perceptions has provided a benchmark that will be built upon in the future, in order to provide a more effective service.

ESRC FRL funding enabled my original research and building on that, the ESRC IAA Award helped extend the impact to highlight a special phenomenon, that of online activists, so-called 'ombudsmen watchers', who, based on negative experiences with ombudsmen have set up online protest groups to campaign for change. Such activism has the potential to damage the reputation of ombudsmen. Supported by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) we facilitated two knowledge exchange workshops that first brought ombudsman watchers together to voice their problems; in a second workshop the ombudsmen got a chance to respond to this. The resulting report was picked up by the UK Administrative Justice Institute website, OA, and was posted on ombudsman watcher sites (https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-and-subject-groups/online-critics-ombudsmen). The ombudsmen usually don't engage with their critics - we provided a unique platform. 

In the longer term, we aim to benefit citizens of the UK by suggesting how ombudsmen schemes can better respond to users and improve the consumer experience. Building on success to date and appetite for my insights, there is more to come. Networks will be kept alive after the project is completed to continue collaboration and exchange. I have been invited by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education to deliver a seminar for their complaint-handling staff on the outcomes of my research. I have been asked by the LGO to deliver a follow-on project, looking at their vulnerable customers. Dame Julie Mellor DBE (PHSO) asked to discuss my project and lessons learned for their complaint handling. The OA has asked me to lead a seminar for their members to strengthen the links between the ombudsman community and the academic community, hosted by the Financial Ombudsman Services. This will shape and lead the future research agenda.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AB81E026-0E04-464C-AB6B-1184C84B12DC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Electronics,Energy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Some of the key findings of my research are that people who use ombudsman services are more satisfied and trust the institution more, if some key criteria are met:
- Clear communication at initial contact to set expectations; 
- Giving people the chance to voice their story;
- Keeping people informed along the complaint journey;
- Resolving matters efficient, fast and reliably;
- Feeding back information to help improve the system.

The first contact with the staff is of uttermost importance and therefore the recommendation is to train staff accordingly so consumer confidence and trust is enforced.

Further my study found that the demographics of ombudsman users were quite specific: male, over 50 years old, educated, white, and British. This leads to more questions about access for more vulnerable users of the ADR system. I also discovered in my data that there is a cultural specific approach and expectation of the ombudsmen in the countries I studied.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Most of the ombudsmen in my study are either fully or partially implementing the consumer satisfaction survey I designed and have taken on board my findings to improve their services. They also mentioned my study in their annual reports (2015) and commented on how they implemented the findings in their work.
My project has reached a Europe wide recognition as I have been approached by academics and non-academic stakeholders to present my findings at conferences, visit their ombudsmen offices throughout Europe. Further, the Department for Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy has asked my input on their ADR implementation.
Further, we won a tender that Citizens Advice had encouraged academics to apply for to conduct research comparing the performance and consumer experience of ADR schemes in selected markets.
The methodology that I developed throughout my project has attracted wide interest and will help gather information about the German residual ADR body to help the government transition into a new system.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D4237878-48AE-4BDE-89F1-E44E3E8DEC9D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/trusting-middle-man-impact-and-legitimacy-ombudsmen-europe</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/374595F3-E6E4-4995-BB6B-85B39A28BB93"><gtr:id>374595F3-E6E4-4995-BB6B-85B39A28BB93</gtr:id><gtr:title>A voice for change?
