(a) Automatically releases ribosomes wastefully sequestered by mRNA-ribosomes &amp;quot;non-stop&amp;quot; complexes, which often result from the overexpression of synthetic biology proteins
(b) Accelerates the degradation of mistranslated proteins resulting from non-stop complexes and thereby the recycling of the amino acids sequestered by these mistranslated proteins
(c) Improves host cell fitness, thereby improving both growth and protein production rates, by automatically increasing in response to burden the degradation rate of proteins overexpressed from synthetic DNA.

Our synthetic resource recycling system relies on the modular re-engineering of the ribosome rescue mechanism naturally used by bacterial cells to detect and alleviate the wasteful sequestration of two of their most important cellular resources, i.e. ribosomes and amino acids. To do this we will re-engineer the primary ribosome rescue mechanism, i.e. the tmRNA mediated trans-translational system, to create a modular system that automatically detects mistranslated proteins and adds a variety of tags to them (e.g. mf-Lon, his, HIV-tat tags) or fuses mistranslated proteins with other proteins (e.g. GFP, BFP, mCherry). Through this system, mistranslated proteins can be easily quantified or quickly degraded to efficiently recycle their constituent amino acids.

Our novel synthetic ribosome rescue system will allow us to easily quantify the occurrence and impact of non-stop complex formation and amino acid consumption imposed by synthetic biology constructs on their host cells. This will provide the research community with a deeper understanding of the core feedback interactions between synthetic biology circuits and their host cells and of the main mechanisms responsible for these interactions. In particular, this system will allow to test whether the main cause for the stalling of ribosomes on mRNAs and the formation of non-stop complexes is the lack of charged tRNAs (due a severe depletion of free amino acids) and whether this can be alleviated by increasing the recycling rate of amino acids sequestered in overexpressed or misfolded proteins, thereby reducing the formation of &amp;quot;non-stop&amp;quot; mRNA-ribosome complexes.

We will demonstrate the gain in fitness and production capacity of E. coli cells equipped with our synthetic resource recycling system and the associated increase in production yields of antibody fragments, which account for nearly 40% of the global biopharmaceutical market.

Another exciting direction of this research is that an understanding of how to control ribosome rescue and the re-use of amino acids will also allow us to purposefully design systems that have a controllable fitness disadvantage. This could be used as a novel biosafety mechanism for synthetic biology, as cells could be designed to predictably perform below the level of their natural counterparts, thereby offering a direct means of controlling bacterial colonisation capability. The construction of a controllable resource recycling system could therefore also be beneficial to those seeking to have greater control over genetically modified technologies.

In summary, through this project, we will make a crucial step forward in the creation of engineered cells that are &amp;quot;more fit for purpose&amp;quot; by equipping them with a controllable resource recycling system which will (a) increase host cell fitness while maintaining synthetic biology functionality and protein production yield, (b) improve biosafety through the control of the ribosome rescue mechanism, which is essential for host cell viability, (c) improve reliability and portability of synthetic biology constructs across different strains of the same or even different bacterial hosts, and (d) provide a deeper understanding of resource allocation and how it impacts host fitness and productivity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project, which is aligned with the EPSRC strategic priority in Synthetic Biology and the UK Synthetic Biology Strategic Plan (Biodesign for the Bioeconomy), will directly contribute to the growing excellence of synthetic biology in the UK and facilitate its industrialisation. Biotechnology companies use single cells (bacteria, yeast, or mammalian) as 'cell factories' to produce molecules of use in many different sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, enzymes, biofuels, cosmetics or fragrances. To date, innovation in biotechnological processes has focused on maximising output, but now the challenge is to use cell factories more efficiently by reducing the required input of energy and nutrients and maximising efficient (re-)use of internal cellular resources.

Impact on Society. Synthetic biology's considerable anticipated impact in biotechnology, biomedicine, energy, food technology, and society in general has been acknowledged worldwide by the OECD and UK, EU and US policy makers. The availability of controllable cellular mechanisms that automatically detect and alleviate the main causes of wasteful usage of precious cellular resources constitutes a crucial, open problem in the field. Solutions to this problem are key to increase the predictability, reproducibility, performance, and portability of synthetic biology constructs. This project will offer such solutions by re-engineering mechanisms that control the efficient (re-)use of the costliest gene expression resources, i.e. ribosomes, and the recycling of essential protein building blocks, i.e. amino acids. An important deliverable of this work will be engineered cells with improved fitness and tolerance for functional synthetic biology constructs. This will open up avenues for new research and world-leading developments in the UK lasting well beyond the project duration.
 
Impact on Economy and Industry. The biotechnology and nascent synthetic biology industries constitute the main target for economic and industrial impact. With large amounts of money spent on the development of high-performance cells capable of robustly and efficiently producing biofuels, commodity chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc., the economic impact of resource-efficient whole-cell biosynthesis can be very large (see also letters of support from identified industrial collaborators). The results of this project will have an important impact on (a) the creation of host cells with improved performance in terms of their gene expression capacity through automatic recycling of their translational resources, (b) the implementation of new biosafety mechanisms based on the control of our engineered resource recycling system, and (c) the increased portability of synthetic biology constructs across different host strains. As a first example of improved performance, we will use engineered E. coli strains to demonstrate increase in the production yields of antibody fragments. Antibodies represent 40% of the global bio-production industry with numerous applications in research and medicine, including novel immune-system-based cancer treatments.

Impact on Knowledge and Training. Synthetic biology is an increasingly popular subject with students, specifically because of its multidisciplinary nature and its anticipated significant impact on the future. I play an important role in the training and education of the next generation through synthetic biology teaching at Imperial and intend to incorporate the findings, models and genetic designs of our novel recycling system into examples for courses such as the &amp;quot;MRes in Systems and Synthetic Biology&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Modelling in Biology&amp;quot; that I teach at Imperial. The UK has had remarkable success in teaching parts-based synthetic biology, producing many world-class undergraduate projects, so investment in further research in the UK is critical to retaining the best students in the country and building a successful UK-based bioeconomy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>445501</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P009352/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF4CD176-73D5-4039-BBC7-28D33DC364DD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Synthetic biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
