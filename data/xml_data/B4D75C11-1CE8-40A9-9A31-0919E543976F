The project will provide information about the investments of time, effort and money that families make to access higher quality educational opportunities. It will also help with understanding how children from different backgrounds have different levels of access to educational opportunities, and how this influences segregation on the basis of race and class. &lt;br />&lt;br />We will use data from the Birth to Twenty cohort study, which has followed over 2,000 children born in the Soweto-Johannesburg metropolitan area of South Africa since 1990. Combined with information on a wide range of topics, including health, education and family circumstances, we can determine how far each child travelled to reach their school during each school year, as well as whether they were attending their nearest school or not. The project will shed light in the distribution of opportunities for schooling across a rapidly changing society and contribute to a better understanding of the implications of school choice in the developing world. These findings are of relevance to researchers and policy makers alike.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50363</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9880</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Newton Mobility Grant Scheme 2015 Round 2</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Academy</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1FE5C483-E5B6-4767-8A9D-912A2A277D1E</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The most immediate beneficiaries of this project were the members of the research team, from the two Universities involved. Impact from these benefits relates primarily to skill transfer and to research and knowledge capacity building. In addition, dissemination of findings from this project has targeted both academic beneficiaries, and non-academic beneficiaries. Academic dissemination included presentations at 3 conferences, as well as the publication of journal articles in two international peer-reviewed journals (one published and one currently under review). Our first publication at the Journal of Children's Geographies is available as an Open Access article and has been viewed almost 1000 times (DOI: 10.1080/14733285.2013.812304). A second publication has been submitted to an International Journal and is currently under review.

To ensure that non-academic beneficiaries can benefit from this project, we also organised a small 2-hour dissemination event in Newcastle and a significant half-day briefing event in Johannesburg, South Africa. The first event was organized on 2nd November 2011 by Northumbria University to coincide with the visit of Julia de Kadt to Newcastle, UK. The event was entitled &amp;quot;School choice and children's travel to school&amp;quot; and supported by the ESRC Festival of Social Science 2011. The second event entitled &amp;quot;Education Research at Birth to Twenty Meeting&amp;quot; was hosted on 3rd May 2012 by the University of the Witwatersrand and attracted fifteen high-level attendees from various Universities and organisations, such as Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), South Africa. The event was timed to coincide with the visit of the PI, Seraphim Alvanides to South Africa for the purposes of this project. The event targeted those involved in educational policy making and the provision of educational services. Representatives from government, civil society, local institutions and selected secondary schools, and donor organizations active in the area were invited. 

Post-completion, a senior researcher from the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), Dr Alastair Van Heerden expressed an interest in the findings of this project and we applied for and secured Newton funding from the British Academy. We are currently working together on two more publications. It is important to stress here that we are committed to publishing all project outputs as Open Access publications and also place them on the Birth to Twenty website, to ensure that they continue to be accessible to interested individuals and organizations over the longer term.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7749797-7EC9-4F5B-8CCA-619170AE1D5A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1AB02EAE-8BC3-4C26-97A0-0F54DA596123"><gtr:id>1AB02EAE-8BC3-4C26-97A0-0F54DA596123</gtr:id><gtr:title>Proximity to sports facilities and sports participation for adolescents in Germany.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b65eecf988a45c4b9fcea93bbd4bb71a"><gtr:id>b65eecf988a45c4b9fcea93bbd4bb71a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Reimers AK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7C3E9EF3-4AB1-4680-8AFB-1C17F5364E8C"><gtr:id>7C3E9EF3-4AB1-4680-8AFB-1C17F5364E8C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Children's daily travel to school in Johannesburg-Soweto, South Africa: geography and school choice in the Birth to Twenty cohort study</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Children's Geographies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ad6fa843726fd445dad2a5148d0eefcd"><gtr:id>ad6fa843726fd445dad2a5148d0eefcd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>de Kadt J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-238-25-0047</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I035206/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
