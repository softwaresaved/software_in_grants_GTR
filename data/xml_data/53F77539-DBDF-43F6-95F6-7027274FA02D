Although a vaccine is available, there are still millions of children and adults living with a long term (chronic) HBV infection. As current treatments for those chronically infected with HBV are limited or ineffective, developing more successful therapies is extremely important. This requires a greater understanding of not only the virus but also of how the immune system responds to this viral infection. HBV does not directly cause the liver disease seen with chronic infection. This liver damage is thought to be because of the immune response elicited by the virus. Natural Killer (NK) cells are cells of the immune system whose function is to locate and kill infected or damaged cells. NK cells are a large population found within a normal liver, but little has been done to identify what role this cell population has on HBV liver disease. NK cells could contribute to liver damage in two ways: (1) by the production of cytokines, chemicals of the immune system which influence the function and recruitment of other immune cells, and (2) through direct killing of the infected liver cells. We aim, therefore, to identify the role of NK cells in liver disease and determine by what mechanisms they contribute to liver damage in chronic HBV infected patients. Blood samples will be taken from chronic HBV patients with varying degrees of liver disease with full informed consent and liver samples used will be surplus from those taken for diagnostic purposes. A better understanding of those mechanisms that are instrumental in the onset of liver disease should allow for the development of better therapies for treatment and prevention of HBV liver disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a non-cytopathic virus that is a major worldwide cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver damage is thought to be mediated by an influx of non-specific lymphocytes into the liver, with recruitment mediated by cytokines and chemokines. Our data from the longitudinal study of HBV patients undergoing hepatic flares of liver inflammation have revealed a close temporal correlation of flares with large increases in interferon-? and interleukin-8. We have shown that these cytokines can activate NK cells and increase surface expression of the death ligand TRAIL. As hepatocytes are resistant to perforin mediated lysis, receptor mediated cell death has been implicated as a major cause of lymphocyte induced liver damage. Our preliminary data have shown TRAIL expression to be confined to the CD56bright NK subset, a minor subset responsible for the majority of NK derived cytokine production. We have also observed this subset to be highly activated and enriched in the livers of HBV infected patients. Although NK cells have been shown to be involved in liver inflammation in various mouse models of liver inflammation and in Hepatitis C Virus infection, little has been done to identify the role of NK cells in chronic HBV liver disease. We hypothesise that the CD56bright subset contributes to liver damage by two mechanisms: (i) TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of hepatocytes and (ii) the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN? and TNF-? which could further increase the potency of this subset, contribute to non-specific lymphocyte recruitment and exacerbate liver inflammation. In a cross-sectional study we will assess activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and TRAIL expression of the CD56bright NK subset isolated from the liver and periphery of HBV infected patients and correlate these data with the degree of liver inflammation. To determine hepatocyte susceptibility to TRAIL mediated cell death, we will examine TRAIL receptor expression on freshly isolated hepatocytes from HBV infected and uninfected patients. Finally, using uninfected or HBV infected cultured primary human hepatocytes as target cells, the ability of the CD56bright NK cell subset to induce TRAIL mediated apoptosis will be assayed. These data will define the role of NK cells in HBV related liver damage and, by identifying NK cell involvement, direct future therapies with the aim of controlling chronic liver disease.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-02-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-02-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>315042</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/31864F5E-EB5E-4A24-97BC-9087E4FFAE2C"><gtr:id>31864F5E-EB5E-4A24-97BC-9087E4FFAE2C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Temporal analysis of early immune responses in patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Gastroenterology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5a10439eb35b6873208116977e652748"><gtr:id>5a10439eb35b6873208116977e652748</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dunn C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0016-5085</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/125630F9-2E44-4BE7-9319-4F285FF7FC7A"><gtr:id>125630F9-2E44-4BE7-9319-4F285FF7FC7A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cytokines induced during chronic hepatitis B virus infection promote a pathway for NK cell-mediated liver damage.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of experimental medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5a10439eb35b6873208116977e652748"><gtr:id>5a10439eb35b6873208116977e652748</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dunn C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1007</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0501132</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
