It will be of three days duration and will focus on Computational Aero-Acoustics (CAA) with particular application to aircraft noise.The necessity and urgency of reducing the environmental impact of air transport, including the impact both of noise and emissions, underpins the current workshop. This is a major technology challenge in pursuit of environmentally acceptable commercial aviation and a critical issue for the continued health of the aviation industry in the UK and elsewhere. The availability of affordable and convenient mass passenger air transport depends on the development of new technologies to reduce noise and increase fuel efficiency.The aim of the symposium is to bring together researchers, developers and users of CAA from academia, research institutes and industry for the purpose of assessing the current capabilities of CAA for aircraft noise prediction, reviewing the extent to which CAA has been validated, and discussing emerging techniques and their potential impact on CAA.A group of 40 experts and early career researchers, drawn from industry, academia and research establishments in the UK, Europe and North America, have been invited to participate. The workshop will be fully residential and the attendees will be accommodated at the venue for the duration of the meeting. This will permit a very full programme including evening discussions. There will be no parallel sessions and every participant will have the opportunity to give a presentation.The target audience for the workshop is the aeroacoustic research community, and noise specialists in the aircraft industry who are involved in aircraft noise prediction. The workshop will result in an agenda for further research and development in CAA which will accelerate the use of CAA in designing the next generation of quiet fuel efficient aircraft. The content and outcomes of the workshop will be communicated by publishing electronic proceedings freely available to researchers in industry and academia.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries of the workshop will be the invited researchers, the early career attendees and the industrial representatives on the industry panel. Those who will benefit from the outcomes of the workshop, and specifically the e-proceedings will include most CAA researchers in industry and academia. The workshop will have a number of distinct benefits, for the attendees and for others: - It will act as a reference point for CAA researchers, both those who attend the workshop in person and those who access the proceedings on-line, by defining the current state of the art across a complete range of aircraft noise computations. - It will raise awareness among academic researchers of industry requirements for improved aircraft noise prediction and will guide them in formulating research programmes which will attract industry support and funding. - It will educate industry participants on the capabilities of current CAA methods and draw their attention to future developments which may impact on noise prediction capabilities. - It will identify critical areas across the whole spectrum of aircraft noise prediction where further development of CAA will lead rapidly to improved aircraft noise predictions. By bringing together leading researchers and a panel of industrial experts, the focussed nature of the workshop will also provide an ideal opportunity for the participants to establish closer working relationships and will facilitate future collaboration between industry and academic participants. In the longer term the impact of the workshop will be: - To facilitate the more rapid industrialisation of CAA methods leading to the design of quieter aircraft. - To further strengthen existing collaboration between researchers at the University of Southampton and the UK aerospace sector. The final beneficiaries of the workshop will be the general public who may enjoy the benefits of quieter more environmentally acceptable air transport. The authors of this proposal already have extensive collaborations with industry partners such as Rolls-Royce and Airbus, not only on CAA but on more general issues related to aircraft noise. The current workshop will strengthen and consolidate both of these relationships, and will ensure that any benefits that arise from the workshop are captured immediately by two major UK stakeholders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36470</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rolls Royce Group Plc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Support of Rolls-Royce for the Workshop on Computational Aero-Acoustics for Aircraft Noise Prediction</gtr:description><gtr:id>849F60A6-1DE9-43E7-A0FA-6F0583935998</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Proceedings were edited by the workshop organisers and published online by Elsevier.

This workshop has helped develop a consensus between academics and industrialists working in the field of aircraft noise concerning the areas of future research that should be tackled to push forward the state of the art in prediction methods for aircraft noise.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A5025F23-184C-4525-AB63-52235DD83C01</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The objectives of the symposium were:
- To review and assess how Computational Aero-Acoustics (CAA) contributes to the prediction and reduction of aircraft noise.
- To identify the state of the art in CAA across the full spectrum of aircraft noise sources and transmission paths.
- To define the limitations of CAA and to identify unfilled gaps and challenges.
- To review the extent to which current CAA can be regarded as a validated technology for aircraft noise prediction.

The symposium extended over three days and was attended by forty one invited participants (42 invitations were sent out and only one invitee declined). Additional participants were also selected to contribute to the discussions on specific topics, bringing the total number of participants to 58. These included established researchers, promising early career researchers and industry panelists. There were no parallel sessions. The programme was organised under four subheadings; Jet noise, propagation and liners, turbomachinery noise, and airframe noise. At the conclusion of presentations on each subtopic, a discussion took place in which all of those present joined with an industry panel to comment on the material presented and to formulate a collective response to four general questions. These were:
- To what extent does CAA contribute to aircraft noise prediction at the present time?
- What constraints, if any, limit the application of CAA to aircraft noise prediction?
- What research is needed to expand the role of CAA in aircraft noise prediction ?
- What impedes industry take-up of current and future CAA prediction capability?
Each plenary discussion was led by a rapporteur who produced a short summary of the discussion.

Overall, the material which was presented at the symposium has emphasised the large discrepancies which exist between the relative effectiveness and utility of CAA methods in different areas of aircraft noise prediction. In the case of (tone) source and propagation models for fan noise, the subject is quite advanced and close to robust application in engine design. In the case of jet and airframe noise, the obstacles to the application of CAA are more substantial. Many are associated with limitations of current computer performance, but these also disguise associated problems involved in handling the very large quantities of data which would occur if such calculations were possible. A common thread running through all of the applications is the need for better validation data against which the effectiveness of CAA methods for aircraft noise can be evaluated.

Drafts of the symposium papers were provided by the authors before the event and made available on the web site of the symposium to facilitate discussions during the symposium by providing early access to the papers. Final versions of the paper were received within a month after the symposium. These proceedings will be published in electronic form by Elsevier as the first issue in the newly created &amp;quot;IUTAM e-procedia&amp;quot; series. In addition to the 31 contributed papers, the proceedings also include a foreword and commentary summarising the discussions of the three plenary sessions held during the symposium.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The presence of industrial participants during the symposium means that they benefited from the technical discussion, and developed a better vision of the current research activities in aircraft noise prediction.
