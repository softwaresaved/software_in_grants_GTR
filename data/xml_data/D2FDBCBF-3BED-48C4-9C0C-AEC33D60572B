Conceptually at its broadest level it combines 'feeling good' with 'effective functioning'. This has prompted attention to a variety of facets, from macro level (e.g. OECD's focus on economic indicators of well-being such as GDP and the current UK Government's creation of a 'national well-being index') to concerns over individual physical, mental, spiritual and emotional well-being. This seminar series will focus on a key aspect of well-being, that of well-being in the workplace, often termed employee well-being. 

A plethora of research evidence indicates that poor well-being at work can lead to adverse physical and mental health consequences for individuals and negative organisational outcomes such as increased sickness absence and reduced productivity of workers. In particular, stress and mental health issues are now cited as the primary cause of long-term absence from work. As such, this seminar series will focus predominantly on psychological well-being, aiming to add insight and understanding into the ways employee mental health and well-being can be managed and sustained.

The increase in interest in employee well-being sits within the context of changes to working lives and experiences. Globalisation, work intensification and increased job insecurity are all indicative of 21st century work. Furthermore, we are changing how we work (i.e. the increased use of mobile technologies and less face to face interaction), where we work (an increase in home or mobile working and an increase in the geographical mobility of workers), when we work (e.g. flexible working regulations and work life balance issues) and who works. For example, there are now more female workers, more international workers and more older workers in the UK. In addition, the economic downturn has also contributed to the challenges in managing well-being at work, as employers, HR managers and occupational health professionals are being expected to deliver more, in less time but with fewer resources. 

Given the significance of the topic, a seminar series which highlights the importance of sustaining employee well-being is justified and timely. The series aims to provide greater understanding of the nature of well-being, how well-being can be measured and how it can be fostered. In doing so, awareness will be raised of ways in which employee well-being can be managed in a holistic and sustainable way. The series will draw upon international, sector and life stage differences to consider ways in which the needs of employees can be balanced with organisational performance. It will also bring together non-academic stakeholders from diverse backgrounds with both early career and established academic stakeholders from a range of disciplines, thereby offering opportunities to bridge the gap between academic research and organisational practice, as well as facilitating research capacity building.

Eight of the one-day seminars will each focus on distinct, but inter-related, aspects of sustainability of employee well-being. The themes will encompass: reconsidering the nature of well-being; reviewing current opportunities and challenges in sustaining employee well-being; exploring mechanisms for sustaining well-being in the workplace; learning from international approaches; revisiting ways in which well-being is measured and ways in which workplace interventions are monitored and evaluated; and thinking about challenges associated with well-being extending across a longer working life. The final seminar will take the form of a one day mini conference, the purpose of which will be to utilise more formally the inter-relations between the previous seminar sessions by inviting delegates to reflect on the discussions from the previous seminars and to work together to forge new partnerships to take the employee well-being agenda forward.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In terms of academic impact, the breadth of disciplines involved and the international contributions naturally leads to a broad scope for publications. Endorsed by the CIPD, the Human Resource Management Journal will be targeted for a special issue on sustaining employee well-being in order to maximise readership across practitioners too. Palgrave Macmillan publishers will also be approached with regard to publishing an edited book. In addition, it is anticipated that a number of papers arising from the seminar series will be submitted to journals such as Human Resource Management, International Human Resource Management, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, BMC Public Health, Journal of Health Economics and the European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology. 
The anticipated engagement with multi-disciplinary stakeholders at the seminar sessions also highlights the potential for impact beyond the academic setting, and for creating exciting new research collaborations. In order to promote knowledge exchange, leaflets targeted at HR professionals on best practice for managing employee well-being will be created and distributed via the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development network. 
Given the potentially broad appeal of the well-being agenda, press releases will be targeted to mainstream media outlets (such as daily local or national newspapers) and to more specialised publications, such as People Management and OP (Occupational Psychology) Matters. As the seminar series will run over a three year duration, there is scope for the development of a website to promote the Seminar series which will provide relevant information for all contributors, delegates and other interested parties. This is also a medium by which international contact can be initiated and subsequently where cross-discipline and cross-cultural working relationships can be fostered. The information below gives a summary of potential stakeholders and how they may benefit from participating in the seminar series.

Employees - Greater awareness and understanding of how work affects well-being and the responsibility of organisation and employees themselves for well-being. This can lead to better individual health outcomes.

Employers - benefits include minimising costs in terms of sickness absence, turnover and lost productivity, maximising organisational performance and attracting and retaining top talent. Organisational level interest in employee well-being may also increase morale amongst workers.

Policymakers - Case studies and academic research findings can be drawn upon to direct future policy and highlight priority areas for concern or for future research e.g evaluation and audit of workplace interventions to improve employee well-being. ONS well-being report highlights that government want to measure what matters - increased awareness of evidence on what these issues are will help direct future government research and policy.

HR professionals - increased understanding of employees and learn how to best manage well-being, advise on how to train line managers on dealing with employee well-being issues. Learn most appropriate ways to improve well-being in their organisation and context specific barriers to uptake of interventions. 

Trade Union representatives - To increase awareness of trade of current concerns experienced by employees which could lead to an uptake in Union membership, and could also direct priorities and initiatives that may further the interests of existing and future Trade Union members.
Independent bodies (e.g. CIPD, MIND, ACAS) - Raising awareness of mental health issues at work and the relevant sources of advice and support may encourage individuals at risk to seek advice/treatment earlier leading to better prognosis. This awareness could also help these organisations to identify key issues to lobby round or to develop as initiatives for future campaigns.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29090</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000946/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>D2FDBCBF-3BED-48C4-9C0C-AEC33D60572B</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000946/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>29090.24</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-01-17</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>5F7A15B5-2CB7-4FA0-BEAD-B9A5925BACC4</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000946/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>16723.31</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-01-18</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-10-17</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46FB536B-9B51-49F1-B2DF-5A14789705F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Resource Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>44154EBB-A654-4E26-A79F-AB885BFC3D5F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Industrial-Org/Occupational</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
