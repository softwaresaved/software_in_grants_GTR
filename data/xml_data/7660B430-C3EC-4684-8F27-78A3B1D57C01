&lt;p>To pursue this aim, the project has set the following specific objectives:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>To track changes in poverty broadly defined in China before, during and after the current economic crisis, using longitudinal household survey data that covers urban residents, rural residents and rural-urban migrants, as well as recording labour market outcomes; incomes; and education and health.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;To estimate using longitudinal data the impact of adverse movements in wages and employment on the key outcomes of interest - including income poverty, growth, inequality; and social indicators.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To identify policy options and make recommendations about how to monitor and alleviate poverty in China in the event of the present and similar economic crises, whether international or domestic.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The project will use data from the Chinese Household Income Program Surveys (2008-2012). This longitudinal data allows tracing changes in income and employment, mapping their impacts on poverty and welfare due to the economic shocks since the fall in China's massive exports.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84911</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our key findings from the three papers to date can be summarised as follows:

Income inequality in China over the past two decades has risen sharply. 2008 saw the highest wage inequality compared to that of the previous years. Using quantile regression analysis, we find that compared with 2002, wage returns to education fell; this is particularly true for both higher end wage earners and the lowest paid. The gender wage gap enlarged between 2008 and the previous years; the gap between 2002 and 2008 becoming larger as we move up the wage distribution. The wage gap between blue and white collar workers deepened from the previous years to 2008. Turning to firm related characteristics, by 2008, apart from the very top-end wage earners, the wages for workers in private and foreign invested firms have fallen relative to those in the state sector.

Applying decomposition analysis, we find the rise in wage inequality was almost entirely due to changes in the structure of the labour market: that is to say, due to changes in the returns to worker and firm characteristics rather than to changes in the characteristics themselves. China's transitional market economy is still not perfect. The large monopolistic state owned enterprises play a dominant role in the current labour market by paying their employees high salaries and welfare, which have led to the rise in urban wage inequality. 

Rural-urban migration in China is primarily motivated by an expected income gain and thus should reduce income poverty. However, migration to a non-sustainable environment may increase health risks, and health may be traded off with expected income gains. Using pseudo panel data constructed from three national representative household surveys (1994, 2002 and 2008), we identify the effect of migration on health in general. We analyse migrants' health behaviour - inter alia, whether relentless effort in pursuit of income contributes to a decline in migrants' health status; and whether relaxing the income constraint improves their health care and medical treatment. We find that although the majority of rural-urban migrants have been covered by all types of social insurance, the funding, in particular of medical care, is not sufficient. Therefore when jobs in the urban formal sector became scarce due to the 2008 financial crisis, social safety nets designated for rural-urban migrants could not meet their needs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In August and September 2012 when the two Chinese research counterparts visited the UK, and our tentative findings were produced, the research team organised research workshops in the University of Oxford, Aston University, School of Oriental and African Studies, the University of Manchester and the University of Nottingham for disseminating the research findings and seeking feedback from academics. 

The drafted papers will be soon uploaded as the working papers on the website of the Institute for the Study of Labor in Bonn, Germany; and on the website of University of Nottingham's China Policy Institute. 

Members of the research team were invited to attend many academic events for disseminating the research findings. The PI and the research assistant attended the international conference organised by the University of Southampton in October 2012. 
Professor Lina Song was invited to give talks by British Council at EU-China Conference Budapest on 4th November 2012; she also attended EU-China Dialogue Brussels on 28th November 2012; through her talks she disseminated the findings from this project. 

As the expert consulted by the Europe China Research and Advice Network (ENCRAN), Lina Song has presented the research finding to brief various EU agents throughout this project period. 

Officials of DfID consulted with Lina Song in Beijing in July 2012 about the issues related to this project, and China's labour market and economic policy in general. The meeting has resulted in an agreement that Lina Song is to provide scoping work for DfID on evaluating the lessons and transferability for low income Africa to learn from China. 

In October 2012, the PI went to the head-quarter of Herbert Smith Law Firm LLP in London to advise the firm and its association on issues of Chinese economic environment based on the latest findings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AC8514DF-BAA2-468E-ADC7-D112A7783A66</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/93C93EE1-1EAD-4483-B65C-B2FABF15442E"><gtr:id>93C93EE1-1EAD-4483-B65C-B2FABF15442E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding Urban Wage Inequality in China 1988-2008: Evidence from Quantile Analysis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>World Development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7b9ed1a98bcbb96b77713744cfe5e557"><gtr:id>7b9ed1a98bcbb96b77713744cfe5e557</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Appleton S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E445343D-6302-4F06-B856-561D38E17FED"><gtr:id>E445343D-6302-4F06-B856-561D38E17FED</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effect of the state sector on wage inequality in urban China: 1988-2007</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Chinese Economic and Business Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0accd2d12fe7267a0a4142e04cddbf38"><gtr:id>0accd2d12fe7267a0a4142e04cddbf38</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xia Q</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I035079/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-238-25-0035</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
