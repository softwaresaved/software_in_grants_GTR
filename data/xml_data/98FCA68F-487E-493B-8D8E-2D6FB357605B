These calculations can capture very fine levels of detail in the definition of the aircraft geometry, but the nonlinearities inherent in the mathematical model of the flow, and the lack of sophistication of many popular approximation techniques mean that including these finer levels of detail doesn't necessarily lead to greater accuracy in the simulation. The most widely-used numerical models are typically based on one-dimensional physical phenomena (representing the solution by a series of local Riemann problems aligned with the edges of the computational mesh) and fail to build genuinely multidimensional features into their design. It is easily shown that such models can misinterpret even the simplest of flows if they are not aligned with the mesh, so although the methods are extremely robust and often provide plausible representations of the large scale flow features, the fine detail cannot be relied upon to be accurate. Fluctuation distribution schemes have been specifically designed to address these issues by building genuinely multidimensional physical processes into the discrete form of the conservation laws. This improves the approximation of the fine detail (at the expense of some of the robustness) and consequently provides a more accurate representation of the global flow. Despite considerable success, the original framework was based on a continuous representation of the flow, and this constraint is a little restrictive. Allowing discontinuities provides more flexibility and has the potential to improve both the accuracy in the simulation of genuinely discontinuous flows and the efficiency of the method, especially since it simplifies the application of adaptive techniques. For time-dependent problems, there is an additional benefit in that the discontinuous representation can be used to avoid the expensive step of inverting a ``mass matrix'' at every time-step. A framework for discontinuous fluctuation distribution has recently been proposed, which combines multidimensional physical modelling, inherited from the continuous upwind fluctuation distribution schemes, with the flexibility of the discontinuous representation. This project will attempt to exploit the potential of this approach and apply it to a wide range of fluid flow problems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>336353</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Residual distribution schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0C9E65A-1241-43E4-84E6-573A83A47FEF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This presentation gave an overview of the current status of residual distribution schemes, placing particular emphasis on the recently developed discontinuous schemes.

The findings can be summarised as follows:

 -- By allowing the approximation to be discontinuous in time, we were able to develop a scheme which is both second order accurate and unconditionally positive, i.e. it does not generate spurious, unphysical, oscillations, whatever size of time-step is used in the simulation. This significantly improved the efficiency of these schemes for both scalar conservation laws and nonlinear systems of conservation laws.

 -- These unconditionally positive residual distribution schemes were modified to satisfy hydrostatic balance exactly and geostrophic balance approximately. The resulting schemes provided excellent approximations to balance-driven ``shallow water'' flows relating to meteorology and oceanography (flow over variable topography and in a rotating frame of reference).

 -- Residual distribution schemes were also successfully combined with multi-stage (Runge-Kutta) time-stepping to create a framework which can achieve higher order accuracy in both space and time. These have been successfully applied to the Euler equations of gas dynamics.

 -- Residual distribution schemes for which the approximation is discontinuous in both space and time have been developed and applied to scalar, hyperbolic conservation laws. This provides the potential to capture discontinuities exactly when they are aligned with the computational mesh on which they are approximated.

 -- Preliminary results have been obtained for combining the space-time residual distribution framework with mesh movement to improve its efficiency. When combined with the aforementioned discontinuous scheme, this provides the potential to fit exactly to moving shock waves.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Ultimately, any industry which relies on fluid flow simulations might benefit from the developments made during this research, since it aims to improve the accuracy and the efficiency of such simulations. The aim of this research is to produce more accurate and efficient algorithms for the simulation of complex, multidimensional, fluid flow. As such it has the potential for use in any field in which the prediction of fluid flow is important, e.g. aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, meteorology, biological fluids.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5AA0F272-AAE8-482E-BB31-A5FAA93B726D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D79C470A-7338-459C-84E4-6BD4F1FFC0CE"><gtr:id>D79C470A-7338-459C-84E4-6BD4F1FFC0CE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Discontinuous upwind residual distribution: A route to unconditional positivity and high order accuracy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Computers &amp; Fluids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/35ba7b515572c373f5fe6a164392f31f"><gtr:id>35ba7b515572c373f5fe6a164392f31f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hubbard M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3580F954-2677-4C76-981B-CE0BC1808365"><gtr:id>3580F954-2677-4C76-981B-CE0BC1808365</gtr:id><gtr:title>Upwind residual distribution for shallow-water ocean modelling</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ocean Modelling</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/522641eaaacc5a0155751f156e41690f"><gtr:id>522641eaaacc5a0155751f156e41690f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>S?rm?ny D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7E7063E9-C6FC-49A2-B353-D1F3B75ADB76"><gtr:id>7E7063E9-C6FC-49A2-B353-D1F3B75ADB76</gtr:id><gtr:title>Runge-Kutta Residual Distribution Schemes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Scientific Computing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d25e0b9806145b31a3c605432d612703"><gtr:id>d25e0b9806145b31a3c605432d612703</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Warzynski A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4DE8AB99-A100-4BD9-9AD2-27393CD0AF0C"><gtr:id>4DE8AB99-A100-4BD9-9AD2-27393CD0AF0C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unconditionally stable space-time discontinuous residual distribution for shallow-water flows</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Computational Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/522641eaaacc5a0155751f156e41690f"><gtr:id>522641eaaacc5a0155751f156e41690f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>S?rm?ny D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/96FA9773-6B22-4D49-9036-EC86F140DC76"><gtr:id>96FA9773-6B22-4D49-9036-EC86F140DC76</gtr:id><gtr:title>Discontinuous residual distribution schemes for time-dependent problems</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fec3f072cd8fc77e2f984c2a1920ddec"><gtr:id>fec3f072cd8fc77e2f984c2a1920ddec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Andrzej Warzynski (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G003645/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CFBD6626-50CB-4AA6-8B49-9A76519BA91F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Numerical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
