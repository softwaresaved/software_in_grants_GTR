To examine these issues, we will conduct a 30 month, five wave comparative panel study in Britain and the Netherlands.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The panel will feature a series of embedded survey experiments designed to test the impact of diversity, austerity, and various moderators on political attitudes. Identical experiments will be conducted simultaneously in the two countries, which will enable us for the first time to examine how national context mediates the effects of these factors on public opinion. We will also capture attitude change over time by surveying the same voters repeatedly, and we will examine the impact of the most powerful source of political information - election campaigns - by timing these repeated survey waves before and immediately after European Parliament and national elections.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The data generated by the project will be made publicly available and will provide a valuable resource to the research community: comparative panel surveys are rare, and to our knowledge none has ever incorporated simultaneous comparative embedded experiments.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect a high level of interest in our research findings from policymakers, stakeholders and the wider public. The welfare state is one of the central institutions in modern Western democracies at present, and the strains it faces in an era of rising diversity and economic austerity make questions about public support for the maintenance or reform of central welfare policies highly salient. 

The beneficiaries of this research will include national and local government policymakers working in departments dealing with welfare and welfare reform, including (inter alia) the Department of Work and Pensions, the Department of Communities and Local Government and the Department for Education, as well as a range of charities, trade unions think tanks and NGOs interested in issues of poverty and welfare reform, for example the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Centre for Social Justice. A key focus of the research will be the impact of diversity, including discrimination against ethnic minority or immigrant welfare recipients, which will be of key interest to the Government Equalities Office and key stakeholders working on equality issues such as the Runneymede Trust and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. 

Our aim will be to disseminate key findings to a broad non-academic audience. Dissemination to non academic users will proceed through three channels. Firstly, a project website will be created and updated by the core research team. These will include blogs and plain language briefings detailing some of the key emerging findings from the research. Secondly, briefings on key results relating to migration and diversity will be disseminated through the Migration Observatory at Oxford (MigObs), with the assistance of Project Associate Scott Blinder. The Migration Observatory is a highly respected website committed to disseminating key research and information on migration and diversity issues to a wide audience, which has built up a strong profile with media and policymakers interested in these issues with the assistance of Project Associate Scott Blinder. Thirdly, the core project team all have close links with think tanks and third sector organisations interested in diversity, poverty and public opinion. We will recruit suitable partners to organise joint events publicising and debating the key findings from our research with policymakers, journalists, and activists interested in the fields of diversity, welfare and austerity. 

The chief benefit of our research to these stakeholders will be the provision of robust high quality data and analysis focussed on some of the key questions at the heart of debates over the welfare state. We will be able to provide those concerned about the impact of rising diversity on public attitudes towards welfare and its recipients with the best possible data on how welfare attitudes are influenced by factors such as the ethnicity and migration status of recipients. We will be able to provide those concerned about how changes in the way elites discuss welfare policies influence public views of welfare recipients with robust experimental evidence on what effect (if any) different elite &amp;quot;frames&amp;quot; have on welfare attitudes. We will be able to inform stakeholders on how evolving party positions and campaign messages, through two very different election campaigns, are influencing public views on the welfare state. And we will be able to provide a comparative overview of how these effects vary in two very different societies, providing insight into how Britain's institutions, values, and political parties, shape public views. These are a selection of examples of possible public debates our research will be able to contribute evidence towards, others will doubtless arise during the course of the project, as new issues and debates emerge to which we can bring our data to bear.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>137629</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Utrecht University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Welfare State Under Strain research team</gtr:description><gtr:id>641242C2-AF67-4E82-A09C-F13816CB2F27</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have developed and fielded two of the five planned waves of the WESTUS panel study, in February/March and May/June 2014.

These surveys were conducted in two countries - Great Britain and the Netherlands - and timed to span two sets of election campaigns: European Parliament elections in both countries (in 2014), and national (Britain) and regional (Netherlands) elections in 2015. This is an important new research resource with a rich range of data which we will be analysing further in coming years. 

The primary focus during the grant period was on survey development and data collection. As such, we are still in the initial stages of data analysis, although key findings are already emerging. Some examples are outlined below. We will update the detail of the findings as the research analysis continues. 

1. Immigrant and ethnic minority welfare claimants face a disadvantage compared to identically described white native claimants

2. This disadvantage is contingent, not absolute. Migrant and ethnic minority claimants with positive characteristics such as a long work history are not discriminated against. Conversely, however, migrant and minority claimants with negative characteristics, such as a short work history or little evidence of effort to improve their position, are judged much more harshly than white majority claimants with the same characteristics. 

3. The public are much less willing to support policy that is targeted on ethnic grounds than on class or income grounds

4. The willingness to support any major target group for welfare policy, such as pensioners or the unemployed, falls sharply if such groups are specified as being &amp;quot;immigrant&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ethnic minority&amp;quot;. The panel data enable us to show exactly which individuals change their minds when the target changes. The pattern of attitude shifts also appears to be different in the two countries, with smaller drops in the Netherlands than in Britain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The British dataset has made available via the UK Data Service, along with a detailed codebook. The Dutch dataset will be made available as soon as the Dutch investigators are able to release it.A series of peer reviewed academic publications drawing on the project is now coming through, with several more planned for the coming year. 

Findings from the study will be presented to non-academic audiences in coming years once we have had time to fully analyse the data. The findings are likely to be of broad interest to policymakers from across the political spectrum given the very high political salience of immigration and welfare reform in both of the countries covered by our study.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A17E175C-BF4F-4A26-8435-073A2D3465D8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The second wave of the WESTUS panel, collected in May/June 2014.
