However claimants seek to chip away at this traditional abstentionist policy, in pursuit of extended protection for their competitive edge. Essentially this process seeks to create protection against 'misappropriation', based on the rationale that successful ideas or images 'deserve' legal protection against 'free riding'. To this end, the action for breach of confidence has caught the imagination of claimants, beyond its traditional protection of trade secrets and personal confidences. Their aim is to fashion protection against 'unfair' economic activity more generally (and indeed the leading modern commentators on Intellectual Property Law, Bently and Sherman, note that the action for breach of confidence 'has done some of the work that unfair competition does in other legal systems'). Having originated in the nineteenth century, this action has an unclear juridical basis, the better view being that it is not a tort but is based on an 'equitable principle' of good faith. As such the remedies available are fluid, as is the reach of the action. It is also useful in that there is no limit in principle to the types of information covered nor is there a need for complex or innovative ideas to be involved. In recent years the courts have reacted favourably to the quest for a wider coverage to be afforded to this action. So the previous belief that no duty of confidence could arise without a prior relationship between the parties has now been rejected. As importantly, the concept of 'information' has been expanded to include 'valuable intangibles' which the claimant has deliberately kept under wraps in order to increase their value. Thus far those 'valuable intangibles' have involved photographic representations of an image that is commercially exploitable: the surreptitious photographing of such images in an effort to free-ride on the claimant's success will now be protected by the action. The highest profile example of this involved the litigation brought by the Hollywood actors Douglas and Zeta-Jones against Hello! magazine. Added to this expansion is the development of this action where personal confidences are involved into an action that protects areas of privacy. An important development in its own right, for those interested in the commercial impact of this action the key issue is whether the emergence of a privacy action will spawn a separate publicity right ( to prevent the unauthorised commercial exploitation of the claimant's personality) / as happened in 1950s America and has been happening over the last 15 years or so in Europe. Given these extensions in recent years it is hardly surprising that the House of Lords will be hearing an appeal in the Douglas case to react to the new developments and to assess whether confidential information is now to be regarded as property / an issue of immense importance in terms of the reach of the action. \nAll of these developments need to be assessed. At the same time the uncertainties thrown up in case law over the years need to be discussed. So the concepts of 'confidential' and 'protectable information' have been the subject of judicial debate in recent years, as has the basis of liability of third parties and the nature of the 'public interest' defence in this action. The aim of the project is to chart these developments and uncertainties to highlight the need for a clear rationale and to analyse the potential for the development of commercial confidences law into an action for misappropriation (including a right of publicity). Part of this analysis will involve a comparison of the American and Commonwealth law on the protection of commercial secrets/confidential information.\nThis project will provide structure and coherence for both academics and the courts. The courts welcome such acedemic work, while the common law itself is enhanced by a measured reaction to expansion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14230</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E002951/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6F2E89E-46FA-4084-B88C-26D28FC989C6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Common Law inc.
