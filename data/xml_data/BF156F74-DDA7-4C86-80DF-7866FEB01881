This equipment enables the visualization and manipulation of objects, ranging from individual atoms and molecules to complex pharmaceutical and biological materials, to the nanometre scale. These are complemented by the available fabrication facilities which allow the construction of structured objects, also at this scale.Collectively presented as a 'Centre for nanoscale analysis and fabrication', access to this equipment will be made via a single-point contact within the Nottingham Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Centre (nnnc). The contact will be supported by a strong management and technical team to provide an efficient service that is easy to access for UK academics, and able manage and locate the resource available within the Schools and Centres involved. This single-point contact will also provide means to provide and receive feedback from users, to coordinate training activities and to make the most of any future opportunities for research collaboration and exploitation of the gathered data.The service offered includes 80 days of access, supported by 25 days training and analysis per annum. Following analysis/fabrication the centre will help prepare a short report of the involved work for the both the user and for the Centre's records. This report, together with any feedback received will be catalogued and used to produce a 6 six monthly report summarizing equipment usage and the Centre's activities. This, in turn, will be used to inform the Management Group Meeting.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>162862</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project proved successful at both attracting high quality researchers to the University and allowing them to use the advertised facilities, and others (such those on the related 'materials equipment' access project). We are also aware of the possibility of further collaborative research as a result of the project (and indeed we continue to receive requests to use the service), and have kept in touch with the visiting researchers for follow-up discussions and inquire as to outcomes. Several of our users returned to use the service again. To our knowledge, all of the requests were for quick, pump-priming type projects. Table one provides a summary of the users of the centre by institution and funding information. The data below also includes information on the outcomes of the project that have been communicated to us thus far.

The project proved successful at both attracting high quality researchers to the University and allowing them to use the advertised facilities and others (such those on the related 'materials equipment' access project). To our knowledge, all of the requests for access to the facilities were for quick, pump-priming type projects. The work performed has resulted in various outcomes including at least 5 publications in refereed journals (with several more to follow), presentations at UK and international conferences, valuable contributions to PhD student theses, fellowship and research grant applications and industrial collaboration. We are also aware of the possibility of further collaborative research as a result of the project (we continue to receive requests to use the service), and are still in touch with the visiting researchers for follow-up discussions. Several of our users returned to use the service again.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The funds received only enabled access for researchers based in academia.
