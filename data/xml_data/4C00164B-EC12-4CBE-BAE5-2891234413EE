accountability for hunger</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J018317/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The challenge of world hunger is not only about growing more food but about ensuring access to it. How can governments be made more accountable for ensuring access to food?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research addresses this question by comparing two approaches people have been taking to making governments more accountable for food security. Focusing on the ?food crisis? since 2007, it will examine right-to-food movements and riots over food prices in Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Mozambique. The research asks:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How well do officials and policymakers understand how food price rises affect people? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do people view government responsibilities to protect access to food? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Under what conditions do riots and right-to-food campaigns make governments more accountable for hunger? &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The research will involve interviews with activists, protestors, affected groups (particularly women on low incomes), key officials and policymakers, and secondary analyses of media accounts of protests and activism, and official policy changes and statements. It will improve understanding of how to hold governments to account over hunger, enable policymakers to better anticipate and monitor the effects of food price volatility, and create opportunities for activists to engage with policymakers and government officials.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims for impact on policy and practice among civil society organisations and social movements focused on accountability and rights to food (e.g. the Indian Right to Food Campaign, Oxfam GB's Grow Campaign); officials and policymakers in Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Mozambique, specifically food security units and social protection agencies; and sections of bilateral donor and multilateral agencies (e.g. FAO and World Bank) responsible for food security and social protection. The project will also engage researchers interested in the politics of accountability for hunger. 

The research aims to contribute to strengthening accountability for food security by i) improving understanding of the grievances people have for mobilising around food, to help activists and civil society groups link with popular concerns, provide officials and aid donors with more sensitive indicators of food crisis, and enable donors to promote 'politically-optimal' social protection responses; ii) generating knowledge of how governments respond to mobilisation, to enable more informed political risk analyses, set more realistic parameters for donor technical advice and policy conditions during crises, and inform food security accountability initiatives (e.g. the Hunger Reduction Commitment Index); and iii) amplifying voice for right-to-food activism, by creating new platforms and spaces for constructive policy engagement by activists.

Potential political sensitivity around food security suggests the need for close and sustained engagement with key actors rather than a more public engagement. The strategy will be delivered in two ways. First, by creating a Reference Group comprising representatives of the audience groups identified above, to be invited to engage at key stages: the inception stage workshop (Phase 2), findings workshop (Phase 5), and final international and/or national workshops (Phase 6). The Reference Group will create a receptive environment for the research findings and a space for open engagement between activists and policymakers. It aims to ensure the relevance of the research, provide feedback, and facilitate connections to aid data collection and policy influence. 

The second element of the Impact Strategy involves communicating with a wider set of key stakeholders and opinion leaders on food security and economic crisis, rights, civil society and protest. A database will be constructed from the teams' in-country networks and the IDS contact management system. This group will be contacted through regular brief email updates on progress throughout the project, and policy briefing notes when results are available. 

Research outputs will include individual country case studies, to be disseminated to a national audience, and a comparative synthesis report, to be disseminated at an international workshop in Phase 6. To ensure the research remains connected to the concerns of food insecure people, findings will also be disseminated through at least one local level workshop to which participants from the communities in which focus group discussions were undertaken will be invited. 

The Impact Strategy will be managed by a dedicated team member with extensive international expertise in facilitation of multi-stakeholder engagement processes in policy and civil society networks. The costs will include staff time, travel and subsistence costs for five Reference Group members to participate in three stakeholder research workshops; and the costs of national and local research workshops. 

The impact of the research will be monitored quantitatively by tracking communications and interactions with key stakeholder groups, and qualitatively, through discussions with the Reference Group members, feedback from community level workshops, scrutinising statements, documents, media coverage and public discourse, and evaluating changes in the policy space for civil society engagement over the right to food.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>433706</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung:</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Global Platform on Participation and Protest</gtr:description><gtr:id>59DDB761-150A-4995-8569-D57A0ACD6B6A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An online platform has been produced and will be regularly updated, and new projects being curated at the time.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Indirectly, via myself.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I am acting as an advisor to the ongoing project of compiling data about popular protests and political participation</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Coventry University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Proposal on the impacts of conflict on food security for marginalised communities</gtr:description><gtr:id>85F4FBF0-62A2-4277-9F3E-EB82878AE440</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A research proposal in the areas of food security and conflict is being developed.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This is an ongoing process, and the results of the proposal are not yet known</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A new research proposal is building on the work done under the Food Riots project between one of the Indian team members, one of our research advisory group, and colleagues in Coventry University</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Commission (EC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:department>EC FP7 Collaborative projects</gtr:department><gtr:description>Country Strategic Food and Nutritrion Security Review, Bangladesh</gtr:description><gtr:id>5D2F337B-AF8F-4952-9B99-DAC8E7B0F86C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None so far.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Colleagues from Ulster University, the International Center for Diarrhoeal DIsease Research, Bangladesh, and the International Food Policy Research Institute are also part of the team, which is working closely with the World Food Programme in Bangladesh to prepare this Review.

Price volatility and financial markets - current debates and implications

Financial players such as investment banks, and financial instruments such as commodity indexes, seem to play a larger role in the global economy today than just a few decades ago. A number of international organizations and scholars have voiced concerns over the risks associated with this larger role, especially as financial capital and actors enter commodity markets such as those for food commodities. The debate peaked in the aftermaths of the 2009-2009 &amp;quot;food crises&amp;quot; which saw rapid increases in food prices globally, and food riots in Haiti, Egypt, Burkina-Faso, Malaysia and others.

But did financial actors really contribute to the last &amp;quot;food crises&amp;quot;? What is their role for price volatility in commodities in general? How do increased prices and price volatility affect food security around the world? And how do high and unpredictable food prices affect overall well-being and development in poor or vulnerable communities?

Invited speakers
We are very proud to present Professor Christopher L. Gilbert, from the SAIS Bologna Center, Johns Hopkins University (Italy), and Dr. Naomi Hossain, Institute of Development Studies (IDS) (United Kingdom) who will share their insights on the topic, and take part of a moderated discussion.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.changingplanet.se/price-volatility-and-financial-markets</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Reading University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>684FAFD6-2123-4DE7-92A6-BDEC0432B8FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 30 students and scholars were present, including many international scholars from Asia and Africa.

However, our project has made a demonstrable contribution, beyond that to scholarship, in two ways. The first has been in challenging the mass media to reflect on its reportage of protests. Part of our research involved compiling political events based on newspaper reports. Comparing national with international press and national coverage with local interpretations of events made it clear that coverage of so-called 'food riots' by the international mass media was distinctly unreliable, and that national press coverage was typically uneven and biased. In at least two countries, these findings have been considerable interest to members of the media. In Kenya, colleagues have engaged with journalists in a workshop to discuss the challenges of protest coverage. In Bangladesh, journalists have been involved in guiding the project itself, and coverage of the findings has reflected the media's interest in considering its own role in publicizing popular struggles, for instance, around the right to food. It is clear from the Indian case, that the mass media plays a major role in turning a food crisis situation into a political event. We will continue to engage with members of the media on the coverage of 'food riots', in particular when we publish our methodological paper on the issues uncovered in using newspaper reports to compile events catalogues. 

The second way in which our work has influenced 'the real world' has been through connecting different activists linked to issues of food in the global north and south. Through public events in London and Sussex as part of the project, we were able to bring prominent writers, activists and speakers like Raj Patel, Professor John Bohstedt, Salil Shetty of Amnesty International, members of the Indian Right to Food movement (who were part of our team) and of FIAN together to debate progress towards the right to food, challenges and the connections between struggles around food in north and south, situated, as they are, within an increasingly globalized food regime. In each of the countries, in addition, we were able to bring together activists, policymakers and practitioners in new spaces, to discuss the connections between human rights, protest and the politics of food in ways that had not been possible before. This has created the bases for new coalitions and started new conversations that we will continue to track. 

Since the completion of the project, 11 months ago, a number of interesting and significant spin-off activities have taken place in each of the countries. In Mozambique, a book about the food and fuel riots is being written based on the research conducted there. The research generated a great deal of critical interest and discussion among donors, civil society actors and academics, including around issues such as the causes of the riots, and the problem of the right to food. Presentations at the IESE Annual Conference in 2015 and in a smaller more specialist workshop sparked off a great deal of discussion and there have been written outputs in the annual report on Mozambique's development challenges. All of this has been helped by the Portuguese translation of the country study from the report. With additional funding from elsewhere, the team has also been preparing briefing papers on key findings from the research. 

In Bangladesh, the research has sparked interest among the younger researchers involved to produce an edited volume focusing on the right to food and subsistence protests. There has been considerable interest in the media, signalling that these are issues that people consider to be important and worthy of research, including two lengthy articles in the English and Bengali press. A book proposal has been prepared and a publisher has been preliminarily approached for the work. Given that there has recently been a major regional conference on the right to food in Bangladesh, it is clear that there is much interest in this area. A second research spin-off has been meetings among academics from history, the social sciences, and arts and culture as well as journalists to discuss the famine of 1974. Findings from the Bangladesh study encouraged the team to recognise that the famine had had significant and lasting impacts on the social contract in that country, and a major research proposal is now underway. 

In India, an article from the study is being prepared for Economic and Political Weekly. Additional research is being planned and a proposal developed by other researchers and involving the original team and its advisors is to look at the effects of conflicts among marginalised communities on food security in India. 

In Kenya, there has been a workshop and follow-up work is ongoing with the civil society organisation Bunge La Mwananchi, or the Ordinary People's Parliament, to build on the themes of the right to food.

Our findings have also been sought out for publication on the openDemocracy website, where an article reached audiences in Arabic as well as in English, and was shared almost 500 times on social media. 

At the invitation of a major academic publisher, we are now finalising a proposal for an edited volume about the research findings, along with some other authors. 

Since the last submission, the findings from the research have also been used in a major high-level report on food and nutrition security in Bangladesh. A monograph that was stimulated by the research findings in Bangladesh has been published by Oxford University Press. And the manuscript for an edited book is to be submitted in March 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>71B18020-5CFF-438B-B988-9FC61250BB4B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research confirms our hypothesis that popular protests around food -food riots - happen because for the precarious urban poor, these are the best means of getting governments to respond to food price rises or shortages. Popular protest usually elicits a response, but not always. The case of Kenya - where protests were ignored by the press and political elites - is instructive: elite groups gain little from policies to tackle food crises, and electoral success does not depend on whether the urban poor think the government is legitimate. The social contract has been eroded by years of food crisis that the government has been slow and uneven in addressing. In Bangladesh, despite international press statements to the contrary, there were no 'food riots' in 2007-12. This was because the moral and political economy worked sufficiently well that in general, people did not need to take to the streets - the government responded, reasonably effectively and in time. A difference between contemporary 'food riots' and historical protests is that 21st century people see elections as an incentive for governments to respond - people claim to be willing to vote against governments that fail to act. The willingness to at least attempt to protect people against food price rises or shortages is foundational for public authority and legitimacy.

The project produced four rich case studies of struggles over food at a time of concern about commodity price volatility, climate change, land grabbing, and population growth outstripping agricultural productivity. These provide in-depth analysis of issues typically excluded from research into food security issues, including the moral and political economy of food crises, which help to explain why governments respond in the ways that they do (for instance, by banning exports), even when doing so is so often counter-productive. The cases illustrate the importance of context, and comparatively, reveal the common factors underpinning popular and policy responses to food shocks. 

Our political events catalogue has produced several methodological advances including in a) the use of online news media in developing countries and b) the construction of event catalogues for political analysis. Our use of in-depth qualitative work to enrich our quantitative case analysis has given us insights into the limitations of news reporting of protest. As most protest analysis depends on news reporting of events as data, our findings present a crucial challenge to the validity of much of this research beyond a very basic understanding of the politics behind protest.

A very exciting aspect of the research is that we have been able to build bridges across disciplines, in particular to bring together historians of food riots in Europe with a focus on contemporary societies through development studies, political science and sociology, and anthropology. This has been a most productive engagement, bringing social history to the heart of the analysis of food politics in contemporary development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research outcomes are being taken forward by researchers at country level participating in policy spaces and debates around food and popular politics. Insights from Indian and other experiences with mobilization around the right to food are being shared with activists, scholars, policymakers and practitioners in each country, and results used to plan and organise. At global level, researchers have been involved in the Committee on Food Security at the Food and Agricultural Organisation, been interviewed by the UK-US Taskforce on Agri-food System Resilience, and participated in an expert meeting on protest by the Fiedrich Ebert Stiftung/Carnegie Council, among others. 

The project has been successful with mass media coverage. The Indian newspaper Down To Earth ran a special issue on the research. A leading Kenyan newspaper ran an op-ed and several Bangladeshi newspapers ran stories, including a full business page article in the leading English daily. One of the most influential development bloggers, Duncan Green, reviewed the research. 

The next step is funding proposals for meetings to support preparation of a book manuscript. Other academic outputs are in process. A plan to follow up the research in Bangladesh with a study of the effects of the 1974 famine there has emerged from the project, and a meeting is being held this year to develop proposals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C79AF385-FF79-4596-A9F3-FEB24BF34BF6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://foodriots.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A set of research guidelines, event catalogues based on news media analysis, and textual and pictorial data from focus group discussions.
