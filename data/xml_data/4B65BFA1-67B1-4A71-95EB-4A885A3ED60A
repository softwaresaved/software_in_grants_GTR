This cell contains all the information necessary to generate the complex body of the adult organism, containing many diverse cell types such as muscle, blood, nerve cells etc. The various cells of the embryo all contain the same genetic information. However, not all of this genetic information is used in each cell-type. Each cell-type is characterized by a different pattern of gene activity which is necessary for them to fulfill their various functions within the body. As developmental biologists we are interested in understanding the mechanisms involved in generating these diverse patterns of gene activity. Work in recent decades has shown that the cells of the developing embryo communicate with each other via secreted proteins known as growth factors. Signals passing from cell to cell play a key role in directing which cell types will eventually be formed. During development such signals act to change cell fate by activating or inhibiting groups of genes within a responding cell. These genes act as internal switches directing development of a particular cell types. The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a related group of signaling proteins which are present in all animals. Our laboratory is interested in understanding the role of the FGFs in regulating gene activity in early animal development. The animal of choice for these studies is the frog Xenopus. The embryos of this organism are ideally suited for these studies for a number of reasons. The embryos are large, can be obtained in large numbers and develop rapidly outside the mother. Furthermore, there are excellent techniques available for analyzing and manipulating gene activity in the developing Xenopus embryo. We have recently undertaken a study which has enabled us to identify many of the genes which are regulated by FGF signaling in the cells of the early embryo. One of the genes that we identified as being a target of FGF signaling is Lin28. Our preliminary experiments, which have led to this proposal, indicate that Lin28 has a critical role in early frog development. If we inhibit lin28 function the head-to-tail pattern of the embryo is severely disrupted. Interestingly our experiments suggest that part of Lin28 function is associated with modulating the response of embryonic cells to growth factor signaling. Recently there has been considerable interest in Lin28 because it appears to be important in regulating how stem cells behave in culture. We believe that investigating how Lin28 functions in early development will have great benefits in understanding Lin28 function in stem cells. We plan to investigate in detail the role of Lin28 in frog development and have designed experiments which will allow us to determine how Lin28 regulates growth factor signaling. Lin28 codes for a protein which binds to and regulates the activity of various RNA molecules in the cell. These RNAs fall into two broad classes 1) protein coding messenger RNAs and 2) regulatory microRNAs, which regulate the activity of other protein coding messenger RNAs. The identification of these targets will greatly increase our understanding of how Lin28 functions during early development. We plan to share our observations with our collaborators working on human stem cells in culture. This will eventually allow us to test whether conclusions made about Lin28 activities during early development also apply to stem cells in culture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of signalling molecules plays multiple roles in animal development and has been shown to regulate embryonic stem (ES) cell behaviour in culture. The target genes which mediate the biological activities of the FGF pathway are of considerable interest. We have undertaken a microarray based screen in Xenopus which has indentified a well validated set of candidate FGF targets. Amongst these genes is Lin28a, which was originally identified as a regulator of developmental timing in C.elegans. Recently there has been considerable interest in the role of Lin28 as a regulator of stem cell properties. Two closely related genes, Lin28a and Lin28b, are present in the Xenopus genome. Initial zygotic expression of both genes is within the early mesoderm, a known site of FGF activity. Our preliminary data indicate that morpholino oligo knockdown of the Xenopus Lin28 genes leads to derangement of normal development, characterized by loss of axial structures. Our experiments suggest that this phenotype arises from disruption to the response of embryonic cells to growth factor signalling during germ layer specification. We will undertake a detailed investigation Lin28a and Lin28b function in early development, with particular reference to their role as regulators of the response to growth factor signalling. We will determine at what level in growth factor regulated pathways the Lin28 proteisn act. Lin28 genes code for RNA binding proteins which have previously been shown to potentiate the translation of target mRNAs and negatively regulate the biogenesis of mature microRNAs (miRNA). A major aim of this project is to identify both mRNA and miRNA targets of the Xenopus Lin28 homologues and begin to investigate the role of these target RNAs in development.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>415891</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The role of post-transcriptional regulation by maternal Lin28b protein Lin28 RNA proteins have attracted considerable interest in recent years in relation to their use in the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) and regulating the properties of mammalian stem cell properties in culture. In addition, there is an emerging body of work indicating that Lin28 proteins play important roles in the post birth maturation programme of mammals and regulating homeostasis in the adult organism. Furthermore, there is evidence that mis-regulation of Lin28 gene expression is associated with development of disease; increased expression of Lin28 genes has been shown to be associated with the development of cancer. 
The proposed project addressed a largely unexplored area of Lin28 research and will be of interest to a wide range of academic and non-academic beneficiaries. The main non-academic beneficiaries are school age students and lay persons. The nature of the research programme provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how basic research, using a model organism, can inform our understanding of processes relevant to such news worthy topics as stem cells and regenerative medicine. We continue to inform and generate interest in this exciting area of research, with the aim of attracting the next generation of biological researchers required to meet the needs of the UK economy in the 21st century. 
Impact of the project on the employed researcher: The training provided by this project and the environment of the York Biology department makes a considerable impact upon the employed post-doctoral worker and will have made long term benefits to the UK economy through the development of a highly skilled biological researcher. The project, by its nature, is multidisciplinary, providing training in wide range of technologies. Furthermore, the University of York supports the 'Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers' and provides opportunities for training and promotion for Research staff to secure their long-term career. In addition, all Research staff participate in annual performance review, in a discussion that includes aspects of career development. The Department of Biology provides additional support to Research staff and students through the employment of an in-house training and careers post that provides a range of personal and career development advice, training opportunities and non-academic careers information. Engagement with the activities described below will have made valuable contributions to the career development of the post-doctoral researcher. 
Commercial exploitation: The project was aimed at gaining knowledge about a fundamental process in animal development and immediate commercial exploitation was not anticipated. However, a full understanding of Lin28 function is highly relevant to the areas of stem cell culture and regenerative medicine. The potential of our findingsare kept under review in consultation with Jim Walsh, who is the University Biomedicine, Business Development Manager (http://www.york.ac.uk/biology/working-with-business/contactdetails/jimwalsh/) .
Outreach activities: Co-hosting of a Sixth form work experience student (Charlotte Dearlove) from a local school for 1 week in July 2010.
The one area of activity that I have been disappointed with during the course of this project was my normal level of engagement with outreach activities and dissemination of this research to the wider non-scientific community. At the start of this project I was appointed to be chair of the York Biology examinations committee. This is considerable administrative burden and has seriously impacted on the amount of time that I had able to devote to these key activities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3140BF0B-47F2-437F-82F6-E1039E6D603D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Results in relation to aims

Aim 1 Determine where and when Lin28 proteins are found in the developing Xenopus embryo 
Lin28 antibody development 
We have made affinity purified antibodies for lin28a and b. These antibodies recognise lin28 proteins in embryos with high sensitivity and specificity. These antibodies have been used to determine the temporal an spatial expression of lin28 proteins in early development. These antibodies also demonstrated that our knockdown effectively reduces the levels of lin28 proteins.
 
Aim 2 Determine the role of Lin28 in the response to growth factor signalling in vitro
Knockdown of lin28 proteins reduces the ability of pluripotent cells from blastula stage embryos to respond to FGF and activin. Of particular importance is that we have shown that Lin28 knockdown reduces the phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase/erk in response to both FGF and activin ligands at gastrula stages. Our data support a model, in which lin28 is a competence factor regulating the timing of responses to endogenous mesoderm inducing factors, and, in particular the FGFs. 

Aim 3 Determine the requirement for Lin28 function in early development 
Analysis of single and compound knockdowns reveals that knockdown of Lin28a and Lin28b are characterised by reduced dorsal axial development. The severity and penetrance of this phenotype is increased significantly in compound Lin28a and Lin28b knockdowns. Detailed analysis of gene expression in lin28 knockdown embryos shows that, expression of a wide range of mesodermal markers is down regulated. The phenotype of axial deficit in later development is likely to result from a failure of normal germ layer specification. 

Aim 4 Determine the mode of action of Lin28 proteins in early development 
Identification miRNA targets 
We have carried out experiments designed to identify both RNA targets of the lin28 proteins. We demonstrated lin28a and b proteins bind to let-7 precursors but knockdown does not affect the abundance of mature let-7 miRNAs in germ layer specification, indicating that the effects on mesodermal gene expression that we observed were independent of the biogenesis of let-7 miRNAs. A microarray based screen of miRNA abundance in knockdowns confirmed the lack of effects on let-7 miRNAs but revealed striking effects on the abundance of many miRNAs from the mir-17~92 family of clustered miRNAs. Interestingly, our preliminary experiments show that in28 proteins are able to physically interact with mir-363, which is a member of the paralogous 106~363 miRNA cluster. Moreover , in electromobility shift assays our Lin28 antibodies are able to supershift the Lin28-mir-363 ribonuclear complexes. Our data support a novel model for lin28 function, in which they physically interact with mir17-92 cluster precursors but, rather than inhibiting mature miRNA biogenesis, as if the case with let-7 miRNAs, instead promote biogenesis of 17-92 cluster miRNAs. 
Identification mRNA targets 
We have attempted lin28 bound mRNAs in lin28 riboprotein complexes in the embryo. However, our analyses indicate that the epitoped tagged lin28 proteins and wildtype proteins are interacting with almost all mRNAs tested. At first we were concerned that this was a technical issue but emerging evidence from recently indicates that lin28 bound mRNAs are extremely widespread.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) Our findings that Lin28 proteins interact with the novel miRNA, miR363 is likely to be of interest to a wide range of workers in the field. 
2) Our demonstration that the early function of Lin28 in development is independent of its known role in regulating the the biogenesis of let-7 family miRNAs is of considerable to interest to other workers in the field.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E75C48B2-82B8-492A-B9C0-58A192633F1F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Exiqon miRNA microarray based analysis of changes in miRNA abundance in Xenopus tropicalis embryos in response to compound knockdown of lin28a and lin28b. .
