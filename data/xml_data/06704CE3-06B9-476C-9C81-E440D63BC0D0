Identifying the conditions associated with paternal involvement</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N011759/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>One of the root causes of persistent gender inequalities in economic and political life is that women carry a heavier workload in the domestic domain where they still do most of the work involved in looking after children and other family members. Women's engagement in employment has risen over the last four decades but men's contribution to childcare and housework has grown more slowly. Sen's (1992) 'capability framework' elaborates how state and organisational policies, social norms, and household economic and demographic circumstances shape men and women's options, decisions and behaviours. This framework suggests there are many social, economic, demographic and cultural factors, which exert logistic pressures on the arrangement of the domestic division of labour in households. Yet the relative importance of these factors in shaping men's involvement in childcare remains under-researched and largely based on small-scale qualitative studies or cross-sectional survey data (Norman 2010; also see O'Brien 2005). 

Our earlier research (Norman 2010; Norman et al 2014; Norman and Elliot 2015) used the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) to develop measures of paternal involvement in childcare when the child was aged nine months and three years old. We found the mothers' employment hours had the strongest association with paternal involvement: if the mother worked full-time both nine months and three years after the child's birth then the father was more likely to be an involved parent when the child was aged three. Fathers were also more likely to be involved when the child was aged three if (i) they worked shorter hours in employment and (ii) if they were involved in childcare nine months after the child's birth; but the effect of both these variables was significantly weaker than that of the mothers' employment hours. 

This research project will build on this analysis, using the MCS, by developing more measures of paternal involvement in childcare to establish which employment and socio-demographic characteristics shape paternal involvement as children age from nine months to eleven years old. Part of the analysis will focus on intact households to remove the confounding impact of relationship breakdown. We will also analyse the relationship between paternal involvement and the probability of households remaining intact given previous research has found a correlation between paternal involvement and the quality of a couple relationship (e.g. Poole et al. 2014).

The research questions to be addressed are:

1. How can we develop measures of paternal involvement over time as the child develops?
2. What are the key employment, socio-demographic, and attitudinal characteristics of fathers in the UK who report involved parenting behaviour when their child is aged 9 months, 3, 5, 7 and 11 years old?
3. Do trajectories of paternal involvement over the child's lifecourse vary between fathers and if so, what are the predictors?
4. Does paternal involvement when the child is aged nine months predict whether a household is still intact when the child reaches age eleven?

In examining these questions, the project aims to contribute to scholarly and policy debates about what encourages or impedes fathers' involvement in providing care for their children. It will make an original contribution to the literature on parental involvement by using a representative sample of fathers to develop measures of paternal involvement, identify differences among fathers and explore how their involvement develops as the child grows older. This is particularly relevant in light of the growing attention to fathers within policy debates about work-family issues across Europe (e.g. European Union 2013), including UK policy, where the introduction of shared parental leave is the most recent reform designed to provide better support for fathers and their involvement in childcare (BIS 2014).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed study will generate impact based on being the first UK longitudinal analysis of paternal involvement in childcare spanning a ten year period. Our analysis of whether paternal involvement in the first year of a child's life affects fathers' behaviour when their child is older, and the impact that paternal involvement has on a household remaining intact, will inform social policy debates concerning parenting, child wellbeing and development, the rights and responsibilities of fathers and 'work-life balance' in the UK and the rest of Europe (e.g. BIS 2013; EIGE 2012). We will also contribute to employment policy and workplace innovations by generating new knowledge about how men and women's employment hours and schedules can enable or hinder father's involvement at home. 

The three main constituencies for our research are:
i) Government bodies and policy makers. The results of the longitudinal trajectory mapping will be relevant to the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) who ran the Modern Workplaces Consultation on flexible parental leave, and are responsible for extending rights to flexible working to support gender equal roles in work and at home (BIS 2014). We will alert BIS and the relevant Minister and Shadow Minister to our findings through our policy briefing notes, and they will be invited to take part in our practitioner focused workshops.
ii) NGOs. The cross-sectional and longitudinal results will be of interest to UK NGOs concerned with improving parents' and children's wellbeing, such as the Family and Childcare Trust, and the Fatherhood Institute; and NGOs that campaign for gender equality, including the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and the Trades Union Congress. We will invite these NGOs to discuss our findings at our practitioner focused workshops. The results will also contribute to European policy debates around men, fathers and gender equality (e.g. see EIGE 2012) so will be disseminated through organisations outside the UK via Fagan's links with the European Commission, EIGE, European Trade Union Institute and the European Women's Lobby.
iii) Employers, trade unions and families: Our results will be relevant to employers seeking to enhance their employees' wellbeing and productivity. Likewise, families who face juggling employment and childcare demands will be interested in the results, and what employers might do to help. Working Families provide direct help and advice to employers and parents (see http://bit.ly/1S7t5DM) so are well-placed to tailor communications to reach the ears of employers to disseminate through their existing channels. 

We will build on our track record of knowledge exchange activities from our gender equalities research to create a platform for securing impact with this new project focussed on fathers. The PI will be supported by Fagan who has long-standing research experience on employment and gender equality (see http://bit.ly/1EIrwFr). Guided by our project partner Working Families and supported by the University of Manchester's Policy@Manchester network and its Press Office, we will produce relevant and accessible outputs to target our findings at the intended audiences. We will produce four policy briefing bulletins, one infographic, three media articles and a quarterly blog.

The Project deliverables will be fully integrated into the calendar of dissemination and engagement activities that Working Families organise. This includes two practitioner focused workshops to discuss our findings, drawing on our practitioner engagement networks secured through our current ESRC Work-Life seminar series and contacts at the EHRC. We will organise a panel discussion at the Policy@Manchester annual 'Policy Week' of events in 2016 (see http://bit.ly/1ulYlXE), and during the ESRC's Festival of Social Science (see http://bit.ly/ZM462l). We will target additional dissemination in Europe by drawing on existing networks, as detailed at ii) above</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>158775</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4EFAA11-B351-48F5-AF63-F8F6BEB87C5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our project website 'Which fathers are involved in looking after their children?' was launched in February 2017.
