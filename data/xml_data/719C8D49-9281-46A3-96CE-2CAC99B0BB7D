Natural killer cells are important in this immune response. In particular they are part of the immune system that is the first line of defence to infections. They can also marshal other components of the immune system. Recent work has shown that different individuals have different killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes controlling the functions of natural killer cells, and that these genetic differences cause different responses to viruses and some cancers. In particular the outcomes of hepatitis C virus infection, HIV infection, influenza infection, cervical cancer and liver cancer may all depend on which KIR genes an individual has. To date it is not clearly understood how these genes work in order to generate these different outcomes of disease. However we have recently shown that small peptides (protein fragments) presented by MHC class I on the surface of target cells can efficiently induce activation of NK cells that express these genes. The aim of this project is to address this issue in a detailed study of both natural killer cell function and the effects of influenza and hepatitis C virus on cells leading to them being recognised as diseased and distinguishable from healthy cells. In particular we will study whether peptides derived from viral or self proteins can lead to recognition of infected cells by NK cells. We will also determine how quickly this may occur, and the mechanism that underpins this recognition. The more we understand about natural killer cells, the more we recognise that they can have many different and unexpected roles to infection and cancer. Hence they could participate in responses to vaccines, as well as to responses to immune therapies for individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, HIV and also cancer. Thus the research impacts on our understanding of these diseases which affect many millions of people worldwide, and could lead to novel strategies to combat them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Natural killer cells are key components of the immune response to viruses and tumours. Their functions are controlled by activating and inhibitory receptors including the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Traditionally it has been considered that down-regulation of the MHC class I ligands of the KIR was a major mechanism for NK cell recognition of infected and cancerous cells. However we have recently demonstrated that natural killer cells are exquisitely sensitive to changes in the peptide content of MHC class I. This follows from our original observation that specific MHC class I bound peptides can antagonize KIR-mediated NK cell inhibition. The aims of this project are to understand the mechanism of this inhibition and to determine its relevance for viral infection.
We will use the TAP deficient T2 and the NKL cell lines to dissect out the mechanism by which peptide antagonism of NK cell inhibition occurs. This will be performed by confocal microscopy to assess NK synapse formation; standard biochemical techniques to assess NK cell signalling; and single chain MHC class I-B2m-peptide trimers to assess how much change in peptide is required to antagonize NK cell inhibition.
We will then use influenza and hepatitis C to assess how the peptide repertoire changes following viral infection. This will be performed in two stages. The first is to define the time-frame in which peptide repertoires change and hence define the earliest time point at which this mechanism could be relevant. The underlying hypothesis for this is that the peptide repertoire is made up of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) which can change within two hours of viral infection and this could be highly relevant to NK cell activation. Peptides will be eluted from MHC class I and the peptide repertoires analysed by HPLC. The second stage will be to sequence peptide repertoires from infected and uninfected cells. This will be performed by stable isotope labelling of the infected cells and sequencing the peptides by mass spectroscopy. We will then synthesize key peptides for use in assays of NK cell function to determine the relevance of any changes in peptide sequence that we observe. 
These experiments will define the mechanism underlying the loss of NK cell inhibition in the presence of a normal levels of cell-surface MHC class I expression. The project is therefore important in defining the immune response to viral infections and tumours that do not down-regulate MHC class I.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>344911</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>STOP-HCV</gtr:description><gtr:id>029A3D06-A318-430C-83FA-FEF269D3C398</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stratified Medicine award from MRC</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>We will be using information from this consortium to inform experiments of HCV derived peptides</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have become part of the recently funded STOP-HCV consortium which is a strategic medicine award from the MRC led by Oxford</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>investigation of NK cell receptors in hepatitis C replicating cell lines</gtr:description><gtr:id>181AFABB-76C5-4C85-B459-A5828A6498B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>we have submitted a substantive manuscript &amp;quot;A human natural killer cell receptor for viral RNA helicases</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>MRC-Glasgow has made the doubly transfected cell lines and tested replication competence of the mutant viruses expressing a variant peptide which we would predict would not bind the natural killer cell receptor KIR2DS2.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have been making cell lines expressing both the hepatitis C replicon and HLA-C.
