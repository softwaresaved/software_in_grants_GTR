Since 1998, outbreaks of Bluetongue have spread Northwards in Europe and last year the disease reached Holland. The problem of BTV is clearly growing and the use of modern genetic methods to improve vaccines as well as to understand every aspect of the replication cycle is required. A significant bottleneck however, is the inability to recover BTV from sequence defined clones. As a result, the ability to change or delete essential genes in the virus with a view to producing attenuated strains as candidate vaccines is currently impossible. This project seeks to rectify this and produce a 'reverse genetics' system for BTV. Within the last year the research team has discovered a way to recover Bluetongue virus starting from just the viral genetic material isolated from the virus. The proposed research builds on this success to test ways in which the virus can be constructed completely from cloned gene copies and then deliberately weakened to make better vaccines. The research will specifically target the strain of virus that was the cause of last year's outbreak in Holland to make new strains that can be used to protect UK livestock against this disease. If successful it may be possible to also apply the research to make better vaccines for other viruses which cause disease in human and horses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an insect-vectored emerging animal pathogen with the potential to have a severe economic impact in European agriculture. BTV causes high morbidity and mortality (up to 70%) in sheep. The geographic range of BTV has extended into Europe with regularity since 1998, and BTV may now be considered endemic in Europe. In the last year there was a BTV outbreak that reached as far north as the Netherlands, thus the virus can be considered a genuine risk to UK agriculture. The central objective of the project is to develop a system for the introduction of specific mutations into the genome of BTV; a reverse genetics system Two approaches are proposed: 1. An infectious RNA approach which takes advantage of our recent finding that BTV + ve sense RNA alone is sufficient to initiate an infection (1). 2. The system in approach 1 will be used to facilitate the development of an entirely plasmid-based system that uses T7 RNA polymerase to synthesize viral +ve strands. Due to the pressing need for improved vaccines to BT disease, the project will target the production of attenuated virus that could be used as a vaccine against the virus strain that caused the 2006 outbreak in the Netherlands. This attenuated virus will be used along with strains containing nucleotide modifications and epitope tags as proof-of-principle for the system. The development of reverse genetics for BTV will be a tool that accelerates basic research in BTV molecular biology and pathogenesis. The techniques developed for BTV are likely to be transferable to other members of the Reoviridae, including African Horse Sickness virus and rotaviruses. 1. Boyce, M., and P. Roy. 2007.

International Application Number: PCT/GB08/03945
The invention relates to a method for producing a modified viral strain of a virus which is a member of the Reoviridae family and, in particular, relates to vaccinal viral strains of the Orbivirus genus.

The method comprises:
- Introducing a mutation into the Reoviridae virus so that the function of an essential gene is destroyed; and
- Transfecting a cell with viral single stranded RNA (ssRNA) derived from the virus genome and comprising the mutation;
and
- Culturing the transfected cell under suitable conditions in order to lead to the production of the vaccinal viral strain,
- Wherein the cell complements the function for the essential viral gene thereby allowing the vaccinal viral strain to replicate
in the cell.</gtr:description><gtr:id>66445BC7-E719-4134-96CA-A7020065E06F</gtr:id><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:patentId>PCT/GB08/03945</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Method for producing vaccinal viral strain of a virus of the Reoviridae family&amp;quot;</gtr:title></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Bluetongue virus is a disease of sheep and cattle across the world, which can cause a high level of mortality leading to severe economic loss in countries with large sheep farming industries. The virus is transmitted from animal to animal by biting midges. The geographic range of Bluetongue virus is determined by where the biting midges live; typically in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes. Since 1998 outbreaks of Bluetongue virus have reached Europe almost every year, with a 2006 outbreak occurring in Holland, France, Belgium, and Germany. One reason for the northward movement in the range of the virus is global warming which extends the northern limit at which the biting midges can live during the summer. Another reason is the transmission of the virus by species of biting midge which live further north than the species which normally transmit the virus. 

The main aim of this project was to develop a Reverse Genetics system which would allow the researchers to make changes in the genome of BTV. This has been successfully achieved during the project. The newly developed reverse genetic system was used to study the importance of a number of viral proteins during different stages of the replication cycle. During this project the influence of certain genes on different stages of replication was confirmed and determined including egress and packaging of the virus genome. 

Furthermore, using the system the virus was modified such that it can only replicate in a particular cell type (cell line) - designed by the researchers - by removing a gene from the virus and placing it in the cell line. This allowed for the generation of a replication deficient virus that was only able to complete part of a single cycle infection in normal cells. The reason for making the virus dependent on the designed cell line was to make the virus incapable of completing its replication in a vaccinated animal. This should prevent it from causing disease in the animal or being efficiently transmitted by the midge vector to another animal. 

 The practical benefits of this research are that they have allowed us to progress towards the creation of &amp;quot;weaker&amp;quot; strains of the virus that can be used to vaccinate and protect sheep flocks from the virus. So far the vaccine strains developed as a result of this research have given sheep complete protection against virus infection. These vaccines will be highly safe and will protect these animals from infection without the side effects. The techniques developed in this research are potentially transferable to the related rotaviruses which cause life-threatening diarrhoea in humans in undeveloped countries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The replication deficient virus strains are currently being tested as an alternate vaccine to the live and attenuated vaccines. This has great potential for industrial scale up and commercialisation as the cell systems to produce vaccines from mammalian cells already exists. The RG system allows for greater research into the replication and function of BTV proteins during the virus life cycle and the system is such can be adopted by other reserach groups studying BTV. This has already been the case with a number of research groups successfully using the system.

The development of the replication deficient viruses as potential vaccine candidates was investigated in further grants (European Commission: Orbivac project)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>04EBE01F-CDFB-4E04-99F8-C686578CF49B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture/ Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A primary replication stage and a secondary replication stage for BTV were established and the essential components for each stage in virus life cycle were determined.</gtr:description><gtr:id>64077242-3A6B-4D30-8AF8-5787973B7CDC</gtr:id><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Replication</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>More efficient recovery of BTV by transfection of mammalian cells twice with all ten T7 transcripts.

The NS1 protein was identified as sufficient for this effect, and was found to act through the transcript rather than the fusion protein. Deletion mapping studies have been performed using segment 10 sequences fused to a Renilla luciferase reporter, identifying the 3' end of the transcript as the major determinant of NS1-dependent upregulation of translation. Fine mapping

has identified a sequence conserved at the 3' end of all ten viral transcripts as the minimal sequence through which NS1 can act to enhance viral gene expression, and this sequence has been shown to be responsive to NS1 only when located at the 3' end of the reporter RNA. Our findings are consistent with NS1 having a role in upregulating the expression of the viral transcripts through the conserved 3' ends in preference to polyadenylated cellular transcripts, allowing the expression of viral proteins to dominate in infected cells.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1BE096D6-98F8-47FE-B67F-F2AB96D5F222</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Understanding the mechanism of BTV replication has important impact on the development of antiviral strategies</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>NS1 translation enhancer - Viral Transcripts</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - in vitro</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The exact copy of BTV genome segments cloned into a vector to produce T7 mRNA transcript that are a mimic of the core transcripts</gtr:description><gtr:id>C4E694D2-7AFB-4F4B-B9EF-AD6D40E4A764</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These construct were regenerated in order to develop a reverse genetics system for BTV.

Using the RG system a series of targeted mutant viruses were made to disrupt these interactions. Each mutant virus was rescued and analyzed for protein synthesis and by electron microscopy. In particular, two viruses that prevented interaction of NS3 with VP2 (CT4) and Tsg101 (GAAP) were examined thoroughly. A significant reduction in the relative release was observed for both mutant viruses. The GAAP mutant was found tethered at

the plasma membrane, apparently arrested in the process of budding. VP2-NS3 interacting mutant virus, CT4 virus, completely lost the budding process and all progeny particles were arrested within the cytoplasm. These data suggest that NS3 is responsible for intracellular trafficking and budding of virus particles.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4CAEC4C7-062F-4331-915E-574CF4997BD9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Understanding the mechanisms of virus release has a potential for development of antiviral strategies</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Virus Release</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - in vitro</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>BTV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) driven reporter gene construct to quality the effect of the protein on viral protein translation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BBAB9F00-EFAF-4A4C-8AA9-D13817B339E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This system was designed to study the function of NS1 during BTV replication cycle</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Renilla luciferase reporter gene construct</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - in vitro</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>T7 mRNA and nascent African Horse Sickness Virus core transcript based system that allows for the specific recombination of a synthetic gene into the AHSV genome</gtr:description><gtr:id>8CAC421B-9AAA-4FA0-917E-E2A135FE5B9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This system will have an important impact in understanding replication and pathogenicity of AHSV and will also be essential in the development of a new generation of vaccines for this disease.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>AHSV reserve genetics system</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>T7 mRNA and nascent AHSV core transcript based system that allows for the specific recombination of a synthetic gene into the AHSV genome</gtr:description><gtr:id>7557EC2B-6B4B-429D-94B7-8B1CBBC219E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No actual Impacts realised to date</gtr:impact><gtr:title>AHSV reserve genetics system</gtr:title><gtr:type>New Material/Compound</gtr:type></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Development of a plasmid and T7 RNA based system that allows infectious BTV to be recovered.
