Bringing together Radick's theoretical and conceptual work on IP over the long-run of the history of science and technology, Kochupillai's legal-empirical studies of IP and innovation concerning plant varieties in India, and the resources of the Art of Living Foundation, this project will study a sample of innovative Indian farmers in order to explore the comparative advantages and disadvantages of two ways of organising innovation in a developing nation. 

Indian farmers have traditionally participated in an informal culture of keeping seeds season after season (seed saving) and of swapping seeds (seed exchange), and under this system, new varieties have periodically emerged and been cultivated. More recently, the Indian government has promoted a different system, changing the law to give enhanced IP protection to scientifically derived varieties from state-run institutions or private firms, and encouraging farmers to replace their seed stocks regularly (seed replacement) by purchasing seeds from the marketplace. A key question is whether this increasing promotion of policies of seed replacement and IP regimes that have &amp;quot;exclusivity&amp;quot; as their basic underlying rationale could have a negative effect on cultures of sharing, and therefore on seed-related innovations, among farmers in rural India. The possibility of such an effect was dramatized by the case of the Indian farmer Dadji Ramji Khobragade. Collecting seeds and replanting them year on year, he eventually developed a new rice variety which became popular throughout the region. As is typical of the culture among small farmers of the regions, Khobragade was happy to share his seeds with farmers from other villages. But when university researchers took his seeds to conduct experiments, and four years later released an improved variety, they did not credit Khobragade. Furthermore, under a law governing intellectual property (IP) and plant varieties, Khobragade was not entitled to any share of the profits from the sale of this new variety.

The project will have three phases. In the first phase, a project researcher based partly at the University of Leeds and partly at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition in Munich, will undertake systematic background study of the relevant scholarly literatures while at the same time using the Plant Variety Application database (freely available from the Plant Authority of India) to identify Indian farmers for interview. The second phase will be a two-month field study in India, travelling from region to region in order to conduct in-depth interviews with innovative farmers - that is, farmers who have registered new plant varieties - in order to learn their views and experiences regarding the different cultures of IP surrounding Indian plant-variety innovation, as well as the related impacts on agricultural biodiversity. The researcher will also speak on local/regional radio in India to publicise the project. In the third phase the researcher will return to Leeds to process the interview data and produce a journal article, one or more articles for trade journals etc., and a report for the Foundation. Throughout the project the researcher will use social media, the Foundation's website and related means to promote the project's findings. 

The project will end with a conference taking place in Bangalore and involving the project team, farmers, policy-makers and plant breeders. With the UN having recently released a report (http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ditcted2012d3_en.pdf) stressing the importance of small-scale sustainable farming to the future of agriculture and the environment around the world, this research is particularly pertinent, and has relevance for small farmers and agriculture internationally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will engage with a broad range of non-academic audiences through a variety of channels and outputs:

(1) Small, marginal and medium land-holding farmers: Farmers and farming communities ultimately comprise the most important audience for our research. During the research phase the Postdoctoral Research Assistant (PDRA) will invite selected farmers to the end-of-project conference - for which a fund will be available to assist with their travel and accommodation. One focus of this conference will be to help farmers to better understand what an &amp;quot;exclusive rights regime&amp;quot; entails vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the socio-cultural practices they are used to and how this affects them as farmer-innovators. The PDRA will investigate the practicalities of securing the assistance of Indian legal experts practicing in the field of plant variety protection law so that we will be able to provide training in the legal situation around IP as it relates to the production and registration of new plant varieties. This will increase farmers' awareness and understanding of these laws, helping to ensure they can secure legal protection over plant varieties they may produce, or have already produced. The PDRA will also investigate how best to disseminate the research findings to a broader segment of the farming community - especially bearing in mind that many small farmers will not be literate. For example the PDRA might arrange to be interviewed on local radio with a translator. Depending on interest, and with the help of the AOL, it might be possible also to get regional or national radio coverage.

(2) Government officials and policymakers: Representatives of local and regional government will be encouraged to attend our workshop; our project will benefit this group by helping them to better appreciate the impact of IP protection regimes and associated policies on farmer cultures such as seed saving and exchange, and on farmer level innovation. This can then inform their policy decisions.

(3)Plant breeders (industry representatives) and scientists: The project will also engage with and benefit those engaged in formal seed innovation research. In addition to using professional mailing lists to draw the attention of this audience to our research, and encouraging attendance at our end of project workshop, the PDRA will reach out by writing a non-academic article in a trade or in-house journal or some other suitable medium as appropriate, to be identified by the PDRA during the interview stage of the project.

(4) Non-governmental organisations, esp. AOL: Our collaboration with AOL will benefit the organisation and its trainers as we will be able to provide a training session based on our findings at our workshop to supplement their existing knowledge. For continued reference, a report of the project findings will also be provided to the AOL. Through the AOL, an international organisation, the project research can also reach international audiences and benefit small farmers in other Low/Middle Income Countries.

(5) General public: We will reach out to a broader and -- given the scale of the farmer suicide problem and the wide interest in solving it -- international audience of people interested in organic farming, traditional agriculture and issues of sustainability; this might include, for example, guest posts on relevant blogs, public talks, and radio programmes. A page will be created within the AOL's social projects website giving details of the project and encouraging public comments and discussions. The PDRA will also maintain a Twitter account and a Facebook account to regularly post project updates. In addition, the PDRA will also investigate ways in which we could engage in outreach and education activities, for example by producing schools' resources about agrobiodiversity and sustainability. Such an initiative might form the basis of a follow-on project from this research to increase the impact of the project work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80852</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P007775/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>085E9E17-60A5-4B2D-B9C5-F950A45872C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law and economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
