Papers aimed at policy and practitioner audiences have also been produced, for example:
 
? Harris, N. and Riddell, S. (2010) Is Mediation in Need of Promotion? Tribunals Journal, Spring, 1-4.

A summary of our research was also published in the journal ADR Now, which is aimed at professional mediators: http://www.adrnow.org.uk/go/SubSection_38.html

Sheila Riddell has contributed to policy discussions in Scotland which have had a direct impact in terms of legislative changes. In particular, the Scottish Government has committed itself to the future funding of advocacy services in Scotland and a 2009 Act has strengthened the duties on local authorities regarding information provision and collection. 

Neville Harris met by invitation with senior tribunal officers of the First-tier Tribunal Health Education and Social Care Chamber (HESC) on October 13th 2009 to discuss project findings. 

A dissemination conference was held on October 28th 2009 at the University of Manchester. Two briefing papers summarising research findings were disseminated (see creid.ed.ac.uk for full details of conference). Speakers included Jessica Burns, President of ASNTS, John Aiken, Deputy Chamber President of HESC ; Brian Thompson and Sue Davis, Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council; and Robin McKendrick, Scottish Government . The 50+ delegates who attended the conference included a wide range of professionals, officials and academics.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>80A67E5C-444F-424D-A21C-6113D522B071</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Findings from the key informant interviews were written up in two published papers:

? Harris, N. and Smith, E. (2009) 'Resolving Disputes about Special Educational Needs and Provision in England', Education Law Journal, 10 (2), 113-132.

? Riddell, S. and Weedon, E. (2009) 'Approaches to dispute resolution in additional support needs in Scotland' European Journal of Special Needs Education 24, (4), 355-369.

Whilst a range of actors believe that mediation has a role to play in dispute resolution, it has not yet had the significant impact anticipated by policy makers. Various reasons for this are identified. 

Findings from the parents' survey undertaken in Scotland only are reported in:

? Weedon, E. and Riddell, S. (2009) Additional support needs and approaches to dispute resolution: the perspectives of Scottish parents Scottish Educational Review, 41, (12), 62-81.

Most parents were satisfied with the support provided for their children, but a significant minority were highly dissatisfied with the quality of support and assessment. Parents were highly critical of low-level dispute resolution at school level, believing their concerns were disregarded and responses to difficulties were deferred. The new forms of dispute resolution were used by very few and were seen as problematic by about half of all users for various reasons. 

Data from the LA surveys and official statistics for England and Scotland were reported in the following paper:

? Riddell, S., Harris, N., Smith, E. and Weedon, E. (2010) Dispute resolution in additional and special educational needs: local authority perspectives Journal of Education Policy, 25, 1, 55-71.

Professionalism and bureaucracy were the dominant policy models in SEN and ASN until the early 1990s. The Education Act 1993 in England shifted the policy discourse in the direction of consumerism and rights. Recourse to the tribunal has exceeded the anticipated level. Partly because of highly restrictive access criteria, the ASN tribunal in Scotland has been much less used, English local authorities perceive the tribunal as biased against them, much more so than mediation, while acknowledging its benefit as an end point to otherwise intractable disputes. Local authority officers in Scotland, however, remain highly resistant to the tribunal's existence and accountability function.

Findings from parental case studies have been written up in:

? Riddell, S., Stead, J., Weedon, E. and Wright, K. Additional support needs and social justice in Scotland submitted to International Studies in Sociology of Education

The case studies revealed that parents, generally mothers, go to great lengths to achieve justice for their child, but are often frustrated by teachers' refusal to take their concerns seriously and by authorities' emphasis on limiting expenditure. Utilisation of formal dispute resolution mechanisms is more common among those from socially advantaged backgrounds, but parents of children with ASN tend to be from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Disadvantaged parents are less astute than middle class parents in their dealings with professionals and tend to be labelled as 'problem parents'. There is no evidence that mediation is more successful than the tribunal in allowing parents from poorer backgrounds to challenge decisions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Interest in our findings has been expressed by various official bodies, including the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, the First-tier Tribunal, the Additional Support Needs Tribunal, the Scottish Government and the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Unfortunately the Government-commissioned Lamb Inquiry report was published (2009) before our work was completed. Nevertheless, our research backs up Lamb's conclusions regarding the barriers faced by many parents in England in utilising the redress mechanisms. Neither Lamb nor, especially, the Government's formal written response to it, addresses the issue of mediation. Our research reinforces the need for further policy consideration and several of the above bodies are likely to refer to it in pressing the case for future reform. 

Ours is the first piece of socio-legal research on the use of mediation to resolve citizen-v-state disputes outside the context of the courts. We believe that through the various outputs to date and planned the research has made and will make a significant contribution to understanding of the problems regarding the use of alternative dispute resolution for such disputes. It will provide empirical evidence to inform what have thus far been largely theoretical academic debates about the role of mediation in administrative justice.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AEE05960-5B72-4DBA-8442-7850AC8ECB8D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/education/rke/centres-groups/creid/projects/dispute-resolution-avoidance-edu-england-scotland</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A17456F7-A823-49F1-A651-02AA9C4E914F"><gtr:id>A17456F7-A823-49F1-A651-02AA9C4E914F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dispute resolution in additional and special educational needs: local authority perspectives</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Education Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/66ec073df80e7460bedc78e86e5ccc83"><gtr:id>66ec073df80e7460bedc78e86e5ccc83</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Riddell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/85101D65-3511-4658-A3EF-5F5C19EF6E02"><gtr:id>85101D65-3511-4658-A3EF-5F5C19EF6E02</gtr:id><gtr:title>Accurate vehicle monitoring based on wireless sensor network</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/917fedf7d4ac4a5d4fbb9db6070723d7"><gtr:id>917fedf7d4ac4a5d4fbb9db6070723d7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-84919-239-2</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E39E89BD-E91C-4DF4-841A-663BE2705202"><gtr:id>E39E89BD-E91C-4DF4-841A-663BE2705202</gtr:id><gtr:title>Additional support needs and approaches to dispute resolution : the perspectives of Scottish parents</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scottish educational review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a4b34c991a1c1fb0e32b911a0263b414"><gtr:id>a4b34c991a1c1fb0e32b911a0263b414</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Weedon, E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C1DF9BA1-AA51-4DA2-80E1-06D8E379E8CF"><gtr:id>C1DF9BA1-AA51-4DA2-80E1-06D8E379E8CF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social justice, equality and inclusion in Scottish education</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/66ec073df80e7460bedc78e86e5ccc83"><gtr:id>66ec073df80e7460bedc78e86e5ccc83</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Riddell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C070CD2B-53EA-4560-99AA-C265BFD314B0"><gtr:id>C070CD2B-53EA-4560-99AA-C265BFD314B0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social Policy Review</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3b8179bf6aa17d392e8a5f377204ce1e"><gtr:id>3b8179bf6aa17d392e8a5f377204ce1e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holden, Chris;
