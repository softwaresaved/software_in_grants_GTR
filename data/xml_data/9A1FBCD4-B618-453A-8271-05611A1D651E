Warmer and wetter conditions in the
Arctic, where extensive moss dominated habitats are found, could lead to melting of permafrost and an increase in moss
growth whilst forests decline. Our existing work has included developing innovative models which use the stable isotope
composition of organic matter to provide information about moss growth. This work incorporated both moss preserved for
thousands of years in Antarctic peat-moss banks, and desiccation-tolerant mosses that commonly grow on roofs and paths
and are rapidly activated following a rain shower. Our previous work has shown that the stable isotope composition of
carbon provides a reliable indicator of moss growing season, and the impact of climate change. However other naturallyoccurring
stable isotope signals in water (e.g 18O in water), associated with precipitation inputs and water vapour exchange, have until now been less well defined as markers of evaporative demand.

In this proposal, we will increase our understanding of moss growth dynamics to include how plants respond to different
evaporative conditions, how different types of moss grow, what conditions are best for the fixation of carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere and growth through the synthesis of organic matter. These developments in moss physiology will be
integrated with local weather conditions in models of moss growth that can be applied across large areas to predict periods
of plant growth. We will carry out laboratory experiments in which moss growth is manipulated, monitored and measured,
using isotope labels and growth responses under different temperature, humidity and drying regimes. We will work on moss
species that grow in a range of habitats from wet bog Sphagnums, through hummock forming Polytrichales to desiccation
tolerant Syntrichia. At the field scale, the same mosses will be regularly monitored in their natural environment, testing how
the experimentally determined dynamics apply within an ecologically relevant setting. The combination of lab and field
measurements will firstly allow us to determine the controls on moss organic matter 18O composition as climatic conditions
vary. Secondly, remote sensing field measurements will be made from a distance of several metres using newly developed
LIFT (laser induced fluouresence transient) technology. By understanding the link between moss growth dynamics and
photosynthetic activation over this larger spatial scale we will establish a baseline that will allow remote sensing
methodologies, such as measurements from aeroplanes and satellites, to be used to monitor moss performance in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
1. Academics and researchers in photosynthesis research.
2. Academics and researchers in palaeoclimate research.
3. Government and international agencies involved in evaluating ecosystem services, conservation and the impact of
climate change.
4. Postdoctoral researcher employed on the project.
5. The general public and the need for outreach activities to explain the impacts of a changing climate and interaction with
the water cycle
6. The next generation: school children and undergraduate students

How will they benefit from this research?

1. Researchers will receive comprehensive new information about the biochemical fractionation factor of mosses with
different life forms, relative timings of assimilation and growth and the scaling up of fluorescence measurements from leaf
to regional scales.
2. Researchers working on palaeoclimate peat archives will have new tools to facilitate interpretation of both records that
have previously been analysed, and new archives
3. The research will have a major impact on the fundamental understanding that will be essential as novel fluorescence
techniques are scaled up to be used over a large spatial areas to assess ecosystem and habitat change
4. The PDRA will receive a wide training in plant integrative physiological ecology, professional skills and wider training
courses, and the opportunity to interact closely with researchers on an international scale.
5. The research findings relate to issues of public interest including biodiversity and climate change.
6. The research has wide educational value, at all levels through schools and Universities

What will be done to ensure they benefit from this research?

1. Publish results in high-impact journals in a timely fashion. Present research results at international meetings and
institutions
2. Submit data and models to relevant international depositories.
3 Ensure outputs are disseminated for uptake by government and conservation agencies.
4. Provide information and mentoring to ensure uptake of postdoctoral training schemes, including regular progress reviews
and career development plans. Encourage participation in the dissemination of results, and understanding of the wider
implications and applications of the research.
5. Use results as part of our regular engagement with non-academic audiences, e.g. local interest groups, schools, local
and national shows, science showcases, media. Take advantage of the display opportunities at Wicken Fen Visitor Centre.
6. Involve school children and undergraduate students in a practical sense (visits, websites providing teaching resources,
blogging and laboratory summer placements for undergraduates).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>52315</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>50000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Soil security</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>NE/P014097/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>247DBA15-299D-4405-A04B-7FCF6907FE9C</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Former agriculturally used peat fenlands, which are now managed for regeneration, take, however, a long time to start removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere again.
