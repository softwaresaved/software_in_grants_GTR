A relatively frail textile, the original has survived war, upheavals, the elements of weather and changing ownerships. It has enjoyed the protection of 30 successive generations of patrons who saw in it a cultural legacy worth preserving and the narrative told in 50 scenes worth passing on through the ages.

The tapestry makes for one of the earliest serial artworks; an influence on modern and contemporary art forms ranging from Minimalism, comics and movies. While the small image of the comet at first sight resembles a naive child's drawing, it is fact an incredibly sophisticated synthesis of scientific observation and creative imagination which describes the comets speed, direction and luminosity of a moving object 800 years before the advent of photography while adding a level of poetic expression and wonder which also conveys the feelings and experiences of the people who were there to witness it and with whom we can identify today.

The Space Tapestry is an equally ambitious attempt to create a large scale visual narrative, rooted in contemporary technology and perception but with the aim to last for at least another 1000 years ahead, to create a report of our human quest for space, made in our time, with one eye to history and another eye into the future. To simply say, 'We were here, this is what we saw, this is what we knew, this is what we looked for, this is what we believed in, and this is what amazed us'.

The final artwork will be too large to be seen in one venue, so a series of exhibitions are planned. The first two confirmed venues in the UK are Tate Liverpool and the Museum of the History of Science, University of Oxford in 2017 to a combined audience of nearly half a million people. In Liverpool, the learning department will work closely with the Astrophysics department at LJMU to develop learning events around the project and at MHS Oxford, the theme is perfectly suited to create a powerful synergy with the collection, one of the world's finest assemblages of material culture relating to the history of science.

In 1885, Elizabeth Wardle, a skilled embroiderer and wife of Thomas Wardle, associate of William Morris, visited Bayeux and was inspired to create a replica of the tapestry for England. She brought together 35 women to complete the work which then toured all over England and internationally for over a decade before settling into its current and permanent home at the Museum of Reading.

Likewise, I am working with a group of young artists assistants to realise the full scale work. I prepared the designs and my assistants help me fill in the outlines, collectively exploring a world of tonalities and patterns. My process draws on each individual's personality, unique anatomy, shifting moods and energy levels, creating the widest variety of marks, often arbitrary, incomplete or complete with flaws and endless possibilities, displaying a depth of humanity throughout the work.

I never accept unpaid interns but am adamant about paying young people which naturally creates diversity. I recruit from University Arts and give priority to minority applicants who bring a great range of experience to this work which in effect draws on subtle influences from all over the world. Despite being black and white, the drawings vibrate so much with energy they appear to be in colour, an energy I believe will still be vital and evident 1000 years from now.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Aleksandra Mir - Outreach Policy

- My involvement in the Space World proper in the capacity as an artist has only in the past year included my lectures on art at the International Space University in Strasbourg, participation as the only artist speaker among 1000 delegates at the UK Space Conference in Liverpool, invitation to attend the UK Space Agency organised Space Life Science ELIPSE conference at the Imperial War Museum and participation in the last two Reinventing Space conferences organised by the British Interplanetary Society. I see it as part of my mission to reach beyond the art world, to connect and to communicate the work to the many other worlds out there, students, specialists and the general public.

- I regularly promote my work through lectures, workshops and publishing in print and my through my 15 year old web site archive that holds documentation on over 20
 years of work and 600 third party critical texts: www.aleksandramir.info

- I host several gatherings every year for space experts and advisors in my artist's studio to offer a reciprocal view on my work to their and that I am am invited to in the field.

- The completed artwork will circulate in the UK and Internationally for a very long time. Art has a tendency to mature slowly and circulate endlessly so in the context of my existing works in museum collections, together with their respective conservation departments, I am already planning the maintenance and archiving of my work to well beyond my death. The final objective is to make the work last for at least 1000 years and as such the final audience numbers are unpredictably immense.

Tate Liverpool - Outreach Policy:

&amp;quot;Tate Liverpool's visitor figure for our free to enter ground floor Wolfson Gallery for this period is estimated to 293,000 visitors. The number of special events in our Public Programme dedicated to this exhibition would be in the region of two to five, ranging in nature from artist's talks, symposia or seminars, exhibition tours and workshops, to family and early years programming.

The development of this project will be supported in the context of our integrated exhibitions and learning programme by a number of meetings in the coming months, led by the curatorial team working across both exhibitions and learning departments &amp;quot;.
