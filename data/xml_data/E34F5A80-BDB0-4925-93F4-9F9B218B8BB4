infrastructure and health service valuation and delivery (IWUN)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/N013565/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>There is considerable evidence that a healthy natural environment - particularly where people live - and regular access to it, can contribute positively to the health and wellbeing of the population, and that it has the most benefit on those with the highest levels of ill-health. As society looks for cost effective ways to boost mental and physical health and quality of life, it is clear that increased positive interaction between people and the natural environment could be a significant part of the UK's future health care arrangements.
However, this potential is not yet being fulfilled - in part because we do not fully understand how and why people interact with the natural environment, and which aspects of the environment, and people's experience of it, lead to positive health and wellbeing outcomes. Does the biodiversity of a place affect people's health and wellbeing? Why are some sections of society, on whom natural environments could have the greatest positive impact, less likely than average to visit natural places? What part does experience of and connection to nature play? What role does access to a high quality natural environment have in the health and wellbeing of people at particularly significant stages in their lives (when they are most vulnerable to ill-health)? If we understood the physical, psychological and socio-economic reasons why members of black, asian and minority ethnic communities, the elderly, disadvantaged urban residents, and those from lower socio-economic groups (in particular) interact with the natural environment as they do - and how this changes through their lives - it would enable us to design and manage our urban spaces more effectively to generate health and wellbeing benefits, and to engage critically important sections of society more effectively, to great social and economic benefit.

This project will study the interaction within one large city between people, their local natural environment and their health and wellbeing. It aims to:
1. Understand at a detailed level how the health and wellbeing of the people within different neighbourhoods relates to the quantity, quality and distribution of natural greenspaces where they live;
2. Investigate the role that culture, upbringing, social values and norms play in this;
3. Explore how people from different ethnic and socio-economic groups interact with greenspaces and how this affects their connectedness to nature, and mental health and wellbeing;
4. Discover how the biodiversity value of the places that people visit affects their mental health and wellbeing;
5. Develop a way to assess the economic implications of these insights;
6. Develop effective ways to feed this knowledge into the policy, delivery and investment decisions of politicians, planners, designers, developers, land managers, public health commissioners and other professionals, business leaders and relevant voluntary and community organisations.

It will:
1. Explore the relationship between urban natural environments and health and wellbeing across the whole of Sheffield - focusing especially on mental health and using more detailed datasets than those used in previous research;
2. Explore how urban residents from diverse backgrounds (especially differentiated by age, gender, ethnicity and mental health service use) communicate their own stories and values relating to contact and connectedness with nature;
3. Use an innovative smartphone App to record the interactions of a large population sample with Sheffield's natural environment, and its relationship to their nature connectedness and personal wellbeing;
4. Quantify the biodiversity value of different parts of Sheffield's environment and identify the relationship between this and the nature connectedness and personal wellbeing of people experiencing them;
5. Identify the economic, practical and policy implications of these insights, and effective ways of applying them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will produce significant advances in knowledge concerning the value of the natural environment (NE) for human health and wellbeing (H&amp;amp;W), and the characteristics of the NE, and aspects of nature experience that generate H&amp;amp;W outcomes. The project also specifically addresses the diversity of values affecting engagement with the NE, and develops a framework for the valuation of green/blue infrastructure interventions aimed at improving H&amp;amp;W, including their impact on other ecosystem services.

Valuing and understanding the links between the NE and H&amp;amp;W is essential to promote healthy urban populations and urban ecosystems, crucial given the dramatic global shift toward urbanisation, projected to increase from 46.6% to 69.6% between 2000-2050 (United Nations, 2007). 

The project demonstrates the use of innovative research methods across a number of work packages (WPs) e.g. WP2 works collaboratively with stakeholder organisations and mental health service users to co-produce creative outputs that explore the ways in which the NE is understood and experienced in relation to recovery from mental illness. WP3 moves beyond the limitations of cross-sectional and observational research designs (Lee &amp;amp; Maheswaran 2010) by conducting a quasi-experimental study using an innovative smartphone App intervention to evaluate the relationship between NE engagement and H&amp;amp;W. As well as being a novel means of data collection the App will also be developed for use by NE organisations to promote healthy contact with the outdoors and greater awareness of nature and by health care providers as a green health prescription.

The project also develops new levels of interdisciplinary and collaborative working and capability both within and across WPs.

The project will improve understanding of how to plan, design and manage urban green/blue infrastructure for health and wellbeing outcomes. It will inform decision making around how to optimize the quantity, distribution, quality and connectivity of urban green space to boost H&amp;amp;W, and mitigate health inequalities in urban populations. It will help define the role of urban biodiversity, facilitating an understanding of the ways in which planning for biodiversity and H&amp;amp;W may be mutually compatible. It will establish clear linkages between the underlying evidence base and the implications at different urban spatial (city wide planning, site specific design) and temporal scales (e.g. cycles of vegetation growth and succession). As such the project will change the practice of organizations and professions involved in spatial planning, design and management of the NE, including planners, landscape architects, land managers, as well as local authorities and third sector organizations such as The Wildlife Trusts, Groundwork Trusts, and the Natural Trust. Through improving opportunities for contact and engagement with the NE both recreationally and as a green prescription the project will improve the health and wellbeing of urban populations and mental health service users in the UK, Europe and beyond.

It will inform public health programmes and health service provision e.g. through 'green prescribing'. It will impact on the practice of health care and social care professionals. It has the potential to change organisational culture and practice by highlighting opportunities for joined up service provision and cost savings across the NE and health sectors.

The findings will lead to policy changes at both national and local levels e.g. review of the ANGST Guidelines: Natural England's Accessible Natural Greenspace standards for access, naturalness and connectivity of nearby nature 2010; Sheffield City Council's Green and Open Space Strategy 2010-2030, or the Sheffield Strategy for Mental Health and Wellbeing (2009).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1048904</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster at the Urban Green Infrastructure symposium (8th December, 2016: Sheffield)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9333C897-5212-4114-8757-12BE7633BAF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presented at the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) symposium for early and mid-career researchers held on the 8th December, 2016 at the University of Sheffield.
