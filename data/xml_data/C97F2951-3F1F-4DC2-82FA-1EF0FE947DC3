The project team have delivered a highly successful InnovateUK feasibility project demonstrating that existing sound effects libraries can be replaced by sound synthesis techniques that use software algorithms to generate the desired sounds, enabling high quality sound effects across all forms of content creation. But the biggest challenge for professional sound design is the effort required to integrate sound effects into the timeline and story, and synchronise them with video or animation content. 
The Autonomous Systems for Sound Integration and GeneratioN (ASSIGN) project will deliver and validate a prototype sensor-driven sound synthesis service, capable of autonomous decision-making for use by anyone wanting to enhance or interact with sounds. It will allow synthesis of any sound, with integration into existing workflows,. 
The ASSIGN system generates sounds with their context from other sensor data. It uses animation storyboarding and visual object recognition information to automatically synthesize sounds and effects with their correct to drive sound generation, placement and perspective, thus enabling new forms of interaction. 
By exploiting sensors to generate sounds and their context, we give intelligence to the sound effects generation. This fits nicely with computer graphics approaches, where much of the animation is driven by some high level information, e.g., if a man drops a glass, we see it falling in the virtual world of the game, film or augmented reality. The animation is a property of the object, and sound effects should follow this same paradigm, thus enabling synchronisation of sound effects with CGI in immersive, game, film and augmented reality design.
ASSIGN has the potential to revolutionize the sound design process for production of film, TV and animation content. By integrating such technologies with intuitive cloud media production tools developed by the lead partner, RPPtv, we can deliver a novel, sensor-driven SFX synthesis service. It democratises the industry, giving anyone the ability to become a sound designer, giving users control, harnessing their creativity. 
Initial work by the academic partner in this area has shown great promise. A wide range of sounds, including sound textures, soundscapes and impulse sounds covering most popular sound effects can be synthesized in real-time with high quality and relevant user controls. But significant research questions remain unanswered; 

- How rich and relevant are available metadata for control and placement of synthesized sound effects?
- How effective are state-of-the-art object and scene recognition and object tracking methods for extracting details of an acoustic environment?
- How versatile are the sound synthesis models?
- How can the parameters of sound synthesis models be mapped to intuitive controls?
- How should autonomous sound effect generation and integration methods be evaluated? 

The project is industry-led, with an experienced academic partner and validated with industry users. It exploits the outputs of a highly successful InnovateUK Feasibility Study and groundbreaking research from Queen Mary University of London's audio engineering team. It brings together knowledge, skills and technologies from immersive and games audio production, cloud service delivery and academic research excellence. A demonstrator of the service will be evaluated and validated in audio post-production with immersive, object-based and 3D audio specialists Gareth Llewelyn Sound. The business potential is compelling, since the project will demonstrate a disruptive cloud service for a globally used and purchased media resource. The outputs will include a prototype for CGI-linked SFX production, with full market analysis, business models and road map to launch a commercial service.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economic Impacts
This project will result in a new digital autonomous system for creating and delivering sound effects to multiple creative sectors, saving time and money in the content production process. Long term, it enables a full suite of production tools using generative techniques, for commercial deployment in a wide variety of media. A wide range of players from a diversity of markets spanning audio post-production and immersive content creation, game audio, security and health monitoring will be able to offer high quality and perceptually relevant sound generation as part of their products and applications. These impacts will come through both existing and newly developed commercial relationships between such companies and customers and the project partners. In particular, the academic partner has frequent contact with audio production companies through his leading role in the Audio Engineering Society. Additional impact routes will come through exhibition at trade shows such as the IBC, and a focused workshop at Pinewood Studios, showcasing the system to film production professionals.
The research provides a stimulus to the UK visual and sound effects industries by lowering barriers to entry and providing access to scaleable resources. It enables new jobs in an industry sector which traditionally recruits young people and increases the role of the UK in the worldwide entertainment content creation and production workflow and sound synthesis service sectors.
The research will also impact the wider public in the long term by addressing the needs of the market for amateur and homemade media productions. This market is vast. Over 300 hours of new content is uploaded to youtube every minute. The overwhelming majority of this is amateur and would benefit from intelligent and intuitive sound design technologies.

Social Impacts
The project will place greater emphasis on creativity in the sound effects value chain, which will stimulate the need for and value of a highly skilled workforce. It will result in generation of high quality, more interesting and less repetitive content. It enables faster production, less manual labour, and less rote technical work, thus empowering the amateur producer or content creator.
The autonomous system can be used for environment-aware and context appropriate sound generation, e.g., warning and alert sounds for security and medical applications, engine sounds for electric car safety, as well as soothing ambient sounds for various settings. It will also result reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions through deployment of services within centralized low power data centres.

Partner Impacts
Lead partner RPPtv will enter new markets and enhance existing services. They benefit from the transfer of state-of-the-art academic research on vision object recognition, sound synthesis, AI and story board intelligent systems into their product range, thus reinforcing their position as a leading provider of multimedia technology. Mixed Immersion Ltd., representing user communities, will benefit from faster and higher quality sound effect production, and will utilize this in their commercial projects. QM will promote their research excellence to a wide community and engage with a wide range of beneficiaries. QM will benefit from commercial impact arising from their activities, and the QM researcher will gain skills in knowledge transfer and application of research technology in a commercial setting.

Additional Impacts
Academic research in the domain of sound synthesis will benefit from access to a real-life platform and real-life data to evaluate novel approaches. This project will set a precedent for best practice in sound synthesis evaluation, optimization and control, and the transfer of technology between academia and industry in this field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>116427</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R005435/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
