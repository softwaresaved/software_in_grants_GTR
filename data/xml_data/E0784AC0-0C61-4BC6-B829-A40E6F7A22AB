The bacterial biofilm is a persistent factor in causing and prolonging infection in the mouth. We will target its removal through a new generation of dental instruments that will use cavitation to disrupt the biofilm. This work has direct relevance to patient treatment and the commercial development of new instrumentation. New clinical devices will be designed using the specialised technology developed from our research, to successfully overcome the challenges of removing deposits from teeth whether outside (the tooth root surface or implant surfaces) or inside (the root canal). Furthermore there is good potential for further commercial translation of the research findings from this project, illustrated by our relationship with Dentsply USA who contracted Professor Walmsley to deliver fact finding research and publications on their range of instruments. Therefore our research output will be of interest to manufactures of such instruments. Hence, we believe that the predictors for success for this proposal are high. Disruption of bacterial biofilms on teeth will provide a tremendous clinical advantage in periodontal and endodontic treatment, leading to a new range of instruments, which can be extended to cleaning hard to reach places. The results have a potential translational application to non-dental applications where the removal of and prevention of regrowth of the biofilm is paramount to success.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of our work will ultimately be patients who will leave the dentist's chair with cleaner, better treated teeth. This means better oral hygiene and so, in the long term, less dental disease, fewer non-routine visits to the dentist, less loss of earnings and better quality of also gain life. It should make a significant contribution to improving patient treatment. Dental practitioners will benefit from this improved treatment through consequent better use of resources. Further impact of the work will be felt by researchers both in academic and clinical practice. The fundamental science will be applicable in a number of areas, some related such as endodontics and others apparently not directly related such as ultrasonic cleaning of machine parts. Our Advisory Committee and clinical collaborators will be particularly important in ensuring that the results of our work will enter clinical practice. Finally, a successful system would be worthy of commercial exploitation for wealth creation, possibly through the creation of a spin-out company or license from a manufacturer.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>258475</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FCFD0036-1D49-4DF5-889A-02E77B901434</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Filmed for TV programme &amp;quot;Fake Britain&amp;quot; and showed the use of Scanning Laser Vibrometry to determine wether dental drills were cheap fake replacements for the real dental drill.

We have been contracted by industry to undertake research in this area and the activity is ongoing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have moved forward on the research by using high speed cameras from the EPSRC Instrument loan pool. We are now observing how the biofilm is removed from the surface of the teeth. The work of preparing an artificial biofilm is of interest to manufacturers and we were approached by Unilever to look at using these models in evaluating their toothpastes. We have undertaken work for Dentsply on their instruments which showed that their movement was different to what they had envisaged. We have presented our work to clinicians who are the end users of this research and this has led to new avenues of research on the instruments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8E76F286-5C6E-48A9-9870-C03D027C7E94</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0CC63FB1-FE72-4FCA-A8CC-8CB82A161B39"><gtr:id>0CC63FB1-FE72-4FCA-A8CC-8CB82A161B39</gtr:id><gtr:title>The performance characteristics of a piezoelectric ultrasonic dental scaler.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Medical engineering &amp; physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/290917e0b4d481c071bc963bae3b092f"><gtr:id>290917e0b4d481c071bc963bae3b092f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pecheva E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1350-4533</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/46D04E64-9CA7-4D7D-9D26-ED71B7B1AE76"><gtr:id>46D04E64-9CA7-4D7D-9D26-ED71B7B1AE76</gtr:id><gtr:title>A quantitative method to measure biofilm removal efficiency from complex biomaterial surfaces using SEM and image analysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3ab43f4764858f522fe781fb09e9d916"><gtr:id>3ab43f4764858f522fe781fb09e9d916</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vyas N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0C04ABF7-478D-44B5-A212-83DC3AC30C1D"><gtr:id>0C04ABF7-478D-44B5-A212-83DC3AC30C1D</gtr:id><gtr:title>High Speed Imaging of Cavitation around Dental Ultrasonic Scaler Tips.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3ab43f4764858f522fe781fb09e9d916"><gtr:id>3ab43f4764858f522fe781fb09e9d916</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vyas N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J014060/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
