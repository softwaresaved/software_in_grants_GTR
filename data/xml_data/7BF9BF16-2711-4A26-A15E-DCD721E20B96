Overall, the results from the passive interference tasks show small amodal interference effects on the primary visual and spatial tasks suggesting no dissociation of visual and spatial resources. Analysis of the active interference tasks suggest that dependent on the nature of the primary task, there may be evidence of a dissociation between spatial and visual memory, although this was not a consistent finding across all tasks. Furthermore, the 'purity' of these measures is questionable as all tasks were disrupted to a large extent by verbal interference. Finally, measures traditionally used to assess visual (e.g., Visual Patterns Task) and spatial working memory (e.g., Corsi Blocks) were found to have higher attentional demands, suggesting recruitment of cognitive resources beyond their domain-specific requirements. The overall pattern of results indicates that the notion of separable and distinct visual and spatial working memory systems is far too simplistic within the present context. Although memory for visual-spatial information can be clearly distinguished from memory for verbal information, there is no conclusive support for any further visual and spatial separation. The general executive demands of the primary and secondary tasks were found to be significantly more important for understanding dual-task interference than the modalities in which the tasks were performed. A continuum-based model such as that proposed by Cornoldi and Vecchi (Cornoldi, 1995; Cornoldi &amp;amp; Vecchi, 2003) would seem to provide a more useful framework for interpreting task performance than a model which assumes that cognitive tasks can provide relatively 'pure' measures of visual and spatial working memory function.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The concept of a specialised visual-spatial subsystem in working memory has received growing attention over the last two decades, in particular the extent to which visual working memory can be distinguished from a separate spatial component. Our research highlights serious limitations in using visual and spatial dual-task methodology to selectively target separable and distinct visual and spatial components. Established measures such as the Corsi Blocks Task and Visual Pattern Span are demonstrated to be unsuitable as 'pure' measures of visual and spatial working memory. This research has the potential to impact on a wide range of researchers and clinicians who use such tasks in assessments of visual-spatial functioning of participants and patients.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>52B12DF8-4185-4258-9367-7987C6111BE0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3F12FB45-50CA-4C32-BA22-1A63164AB943"><gtr:id>3F12FB45-50CA-4C32-BA22-1A63164AB943</gtr:id><gtr:title>Working Memory: Developmental Differences, Component Processes and Improvement Mechanisms.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e8e0d1bf9d57c22a1adbb8ccb10778ab"><gtr:id>e8e0d1bf9d57c22a1adbb8ccb10778ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hamilton, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-1507</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-000-22-1507</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
