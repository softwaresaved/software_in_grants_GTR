Although there are a large number of candidate therapeutic genes a major problem has been the safe and efficient delivery of the gene into target cells and tissues in order to achieve appropriate levels of the gene for long enough to treat the disease. Once a therapeutic gene has been identified, the first step is to develop an 'expression cassette'. The expression cassette is the gene linked to DNA sequences required to 'switch on' the gene, termed 'transcription'. One of the limitations to achieving successful gene therapy has been how well the gene is expressed once inside a cell. Most genes are expressed at high levels, in all cell types and sometimes this results in gene transcription being switched off because the cell identifies the expression cassette as 'foreign', or transcription is too high and is toxic to the cell because it is expressed all the time, not just when the disease is active. For cells to function normally they use several methods to switch their own genes on and off and this allows different cells in different tissues/ organs to perform their normal functions and respond to changes which make them function abnormally (e.g. disease). The methods used by cells include DNA on/ off switches called 'promoters' which are only found in one cell type (e.g. liver cells, heart cells, or blood cells). Also, recently a new gene expression controlling pathway has been found termed 'RNA interference' which 'tidies up' gene expression to ensure it is even more specific between different cell types. Importantly recent papers have indicated that this pathway is important in controlling cell's own gene expression while they are growing and also during disease. In this proposal I seek to improve gene therapy expression cassettes by using promoters and the RNA interference gene 'on/ off' system, so the gene is only switched on when disease is active in the cells. RNA interference has very recently been shown to be important in the regulation of genes during a disease termed cardiac hypertrophy (heart enlargement). Therefore, as proof of concept for using these identified RNA interference 'switches' I will make gene delivery expression cassettes to express genes only in heart cells undergoing hypertrophy. Importantly, I will use a virus vector which can efficiently deliver genes to these heart cells in vivo and test the concept in an animal model of in which heart enlargement take place. This takes advantage of our recent knowledge of RNA interference and its function in hypertrophy, the availability of an ideal gene delivery vector to deliver the gene to the correct cell type (heart cells) in an ideal model. This work will provide proof of concept for the use of RNA interference to switch on transgene expression in a specific disease situation, however the concepts will be applicable to the development of gene therapies aimed at many different cell types in many different diseases in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Gene therapy is being developed as a therapeutic intervention in many monogenic and polygenic disorders. For gene therapy to succeed there is a requirement to refine gene delivery vectors and expression cassettes to regulate transgene expression in a cell/ tissue-specific and disease-regulated manner. Using viral promoters results in high level transgene expression in most cell types which may be undesirable, (e.g. cytotoxic or cytostatic gene therapies) and viral promoters are sensitive to methylation-mediated transcriptional silencing. There are many candidate cell-specific eukaryotic promoters, although some show low transcription compared to viral promoters or lose their cell specificity once engineered into gene transfer vectors. In this proposal I will take two approaches to develop efficient, cell-specific, disease regulated expression cassettes. First, I will take advantage of recent data which indicates that RNA interference (through the function of microRNAs) plays a fundamental role in the activation/ suppression of gene expression in response to disease stimulation. Second, I will use a cell-specific promoter (which will be improved by randomly combining it with transcriptional response elements (TREs) that respond to transcription factors which are activated in disease processes. MicroRNA target sequneces which regulate gene expression during hypertrophy will be combined with cardiac myocyte promoters and synthetic TREs linked to genes which are activated in response to cardiac hypertrophy. These novel expression cassettes will be tested in the situation of in vivo cardiac hypertrophy in a rat model using the cardiac tropic adeno-associated virus serotype 6. Importantly, this will provide proof of concept for using microRNA to regulate transgene expression in a disease situation using recent data and a relevant vector and model, however the principles will be applicable to many gene therapies in the futur</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>337389</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BSGCT Public Education Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7CFBE82-7F5F-437F-9BEE-E37DE3BCED4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The annual BSGCT Public Education Day presents science in the area of gene and cell therapy to local school pupils in 5th and sixth year.

The gene can be delivered into cells and tissues of the body using a vehicle which can be of viral or non-viral origin. One of the major challenges with gene therapy has been achieving safe and efficient delivery of the gene into the cells that require it and maintaining expression of the gene therapy in only those cells for long enough for the gene therapy to be effective. To deliver the gene therapy the therapeutic gene is engineered into an expression cassette which provides the signals for the gene expression to be switched on once it is inside cells. Since most gene therapies are expressed at high levels in all cells that the gene therapy gets into then there may be safety issues. In this research project we have studied the switches that can be used to control gene therapy expression in order that they may be expressed in only the specific cells in which the gene therapy is required and also only when the pathological process is active. To do this we have studied the normal process cell use to regulated their own gene expression. For cells to function normally they use several methods to switch their own genes on and off and this allows different cells in different tissues/ organs to perform their normal functions and respond to changes which make them function abnormally. The methods used by cells include DNA on/ off switches called &amp;quot;promoters&amp;quot; which can be only found in one cell type (e.g. liver cells, heart cells, or blood cells). Also, recently a new gene expression controlling pathway has been found termed &amp;quot;RNA interference&amp;quot; which &amp;quot;tidies up&amp;quot; gene expression to ensure it is even more specific between different cell types by the cells expression of small nucleic acids called &amp;quot;microRNAs&amp;quot;. As proof of concept we have taken a dual approach by using either different promoters or microRNAs to control gene expression selectively in the main cell type of the heart, the muscle cell called a cardiomyocyte, when gene therapy is delivered from a viral gene delivery vector termed adeno-associated virus. We investigated whether it is possible to control gene expression so that it is only activated when the heart cells are being stimulated and also whether we could prevent the expression of the gene therapy taking place in cells outside the heart where we do not want it, including in other organs such as different muscles or in the liver. We found that although it was possible to regulate gene expression in cardiomyocytes in culture in the lab by inserting microRNA targeting sequences that are active in normal cells but downregulated in response to a stimuli applied to the cells, this was not able to truly switch the gene therapy &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;off&amp;quot;. However using other microRNAs we have been able to generate a gene therapy vector using an adeno-associated virus expressing an expression cassette controlled by microRNA sequences for microRNAs reported to be only expressed in skeletal muscle or liver. This adeno-associated virus can be delivered via a minimally invasive route through injection into a vein. Thus, the work provides proof of concept for using microRNAs to control gene therapy expression in target cells. These findings will improve the safety and efficiency of gene therapy delivery and expression and can ultimately be applied to any gene therapy application.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They provide proof of concept for microRNA targeting sequences for controlling gene therapy expression.
