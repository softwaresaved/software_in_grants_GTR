However, it also undergoes cycles of material transformation, of decay and renewal, which inform the meanings and values associated with it. Indeed, these changes contribute to the experience of authenticity. Decay acts as a tangible mark of age, and the patina produced by everyday weathering and wear provides a sense of connection across generations. At the same time processes of decay and degradation are assessed and arrested by organisations charged with conserving the historic environment for future generations. Much of this work relies on scientific methods and techniques, which have been developed for use in conserving the historic environment. However, by intervening to modify processes of transformation and decay, these techniques can have a powerful impact on the fabric of historic buildings. They can alter their appearance and introduce new materials, as well as affect the cultural meanings and values attached to them by various groups of people.

In this project we use methods from the arts and humanities, including interviews and forms of participant observation, to examine the kinds of value attached to deterioration and decay in historic buildings. We investigate how decisions about the conservation of materials are informed by these values and related ideas of authenticity. We also explore how science-based interventions alter these meanings and values, and impact on perceptions of 'the real' and the 'authentic'. Our partners include the National Trust for Scotland and Historic Scotland, organisations that are involved in conserving and managing some of Scotland's most important historic sites. They provide case studies involving particular historic buildings or monuments that are currently the subject of active conservation. This provides us with the opportunity to study how the science-based techniques they use both inform, and are informed by, cultural values and ideas of authenticity.

Our project brings together researchers from the humanities and the sciences in a cross-disciplinary collaboration. We are also in partnership with the leaders of a European research project (HEROMAT), which allows us to study the values attached to the latest developments in scientific conservation methods. The research will be of benefit to a wide range of academic researchers and professionals involved in conserving the historic environment. The results are intended to inform future conservation policy and practice, ensuring that science-based techniques are used in a culturally sensitive way in conserving the historic environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries include:
- Conservation practitioners and heritage scientists, through the project's contribution to culturally informed conservation of the historic environment. 
- Our partner heritage organisations: through practical involvement at the heart of the research that will feed into their ongoing and future work, informing assessment and decision-making.
- Members of the public: who benefit indirectly through the impact of the research on future conservation, improving interventions sensitive to issues of social and cultural significance
- Academics - see section &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot;

This project will increase knowledge and understanding of the intersection between material transformation, scientific intervention and cultural value. The results will inform the application of heritage science to problems associated with material degradation and decay. Conservation practitioners and heritage scientists will benefit from new insights into the effects of particular kinds of intervention on heritage values. The results of the research should also contribute to the development of professional policy and practice within heritage organisations. An important objective of the project is to provide a model for an integrated approach to managing material degradation in the historic environment that brings together methodologies from the humanities and the sciences thus increasing mutual understanding between science and humanities-based approaches within academic and professional conservation sectors. Both academics and professionals (in the spheres of conservation, heritage science and heritage management) will be able to benefit from the utilisation of this cross-disciplinary methodological approach, through an improved understanding of how decisions are influenced by both values and science based activities.

The case studies involve real, ongoing, interventions such that our findings may have an impact on their eventual outcomes. The NTS and HS will therefore benefit directly from the results of the research, which can feed into their ongoing and future work, informing assessment and decision-making. They will also gain first hand experience of the application of arts and humanities methods in the context of heritage science.

The public will benefit indirectly through the impact of the research on future conservation. The values attached to material transformation by various non-professional audiences will be investigated at the case study sites. Through dissemination of the results to those involved in the conservation of the historic environment we will raise awareness of the relationship between the material and cultural aspects of transformation, facilitating interventions that are sensitive to issues of social and cultural significance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79349</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Novi Sad</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Serbia, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Materials Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>HERICULT</gtr:description><gtr:id>789B318D-CA67-48E0-A91D-ADAADFF69E29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two iterations of a full Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN Action Bid were produced and submitted to the European Commission.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The collaborators performed a similar role to UWS, and the Uni of Novi Sad coordinated the entire effort.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We collaborated with the Uni of Novi Sad, on two submissions of a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action, an Innovative Training Network (ITN) bid under call: H2020-MSCA-ITN-2016.

Dr Douglas-Jones communicated the outcomes of field research that she had conducted at the HIll House and from interviews conducted with scientists, managers and conservators connected with the building.

We worked with two major heritage organisations (NTS and HS) and a range of other stakeholders. The main journal article provides recommendations for practitioners based on the results and we have also published a short piece in a professional conservation magazine. A project workshop in January 2014 brought stakeholders and academics together to discuss the results and wider issues and implications. The interaction with our project partners, sometimes through formal research interviews, resulted in discussion and changes of view amongst the partners with regard to the topic of scientific work in relation to value and authenticity in conservation.

We also collaborated with the FP7 HEROMAT project, attending two HEROMAT project meetings presenting papers on the MAV project. This allowed us to reach a wider European network and to bring MAV results to bear on the development of new scientific conservation materials.

Prof Jones is a contributor to the new Scottish Carved Stone Research Framework, currently in final stages of development: Future Thinking on Carved Stones in Scotland: A Research Framework (Scottish Archaeology Research Framework (ScARF)). In this context Prof Jones has highlighted the outcomes of MAV and has offered to include a short summary case study of the project (TBC).

Dr Hughes is leading an international congress on the Deterioration of Stone in late 2016, which has led him into discussions with the local Renfrewshire Council on the role the Congress can play in the town of Paisley's bid for UK City of Culture 2021. (https://sites.google.com/site/sc16test/) This would have been less of interest but for the outcomes of MAV.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C6BFC0D3-58A9-427C-BB2B-3549F848C107</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The implications of this research can be summarised as follows. 

First, material transformation, including decay, does not merely impact on heritage significance. It is an integral aspect of the values that underpin significance. 

Second, these values are dynamic and contextual. They may vary over time, between and within sites, and between different heritage professionals and stakeholders, in ways that cannot be determined in advance. 

Third, the application of heritage science to measuring, understanding and modifying material transformation is embedded in these values; it both informs and is informed by them. 

Fourth, integrated qualitative research methods can increase our understanding of these important, site-specific conditions and processes, and thus contribute to more nuanced and
productive applications of heritage science, sensitive to the values associated with heritage sites.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Based upon our conclusions we recommend:

That further qualitative research is conducted on the relationship between material transformation, authenticity, value and heritage science. The tendency of heritage science to focus on a specific material or environmental process and to extract data in relation to this, even setting up controlled laboratory experiments, means that 'material/cultural interface' (Cassar 2009) is always in danger of being over-looked.

It is not possible to identify rules or models that can be generalized, because the values and qualities associated with material transformation are complex, situated and contextual. We therefore recommend that qualitative methods, such as participant observation, interviewing and focus groups, should be routinely employed to explore the site specific values and qualities associated with material transformation. Data from
such research could then be taken into account when planning interventions and assessing their future impact. 

Changes in training, expertise and institutional cultures will also be necessary to effectively integrate qualitative methods in such a routine fashion. 

Our final recommendation is that forums are created
to facilitate open-ended discussion of such issues amongst heritage scientists, conservators, managers and other heritage professionals. The promotion of inter-disciplinary dialogue, especially across the sciences and humanities, is a less commonplace, but increasingly important measure.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>051E6E31-7548-4AC4-8307-0FEA945E3F9C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.academia.edu/7866020/Materiality_authenticity_and_value_in_the_historic_environment_a_study_of_the_effects_of_material_transformation_and_scientific_intervention</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/ACB577BA-86D0-4075-848F-5377F9093A65"><gtr:id>ACB577BA-86D0-4075-848F-5377F9093A65</gtr:id><gtr:title>Science, value and material decay in the conservation of historic environments</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Cultural Heritage</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/609cf2d69e3854fdf67e1f37f0fa8bf1"><gtr:id>609cf2d69e3854fdf67e1f37f0fa8bf1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Douglas-Jones R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2AD22EE9-837F-4E46-9640-D992A875B346"><gtr:id>2AD22EE9-837F-4E46-9640-D992A875B346</gtr:id><gtr:title>Claiming and knowing the real: authenticity today</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/609cf2d69e3854fdf67e1f37f0fa8bf1"><gtr:id>609cf2d69e3854fdf67e1f37f0fa8bf1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Douglas-Jones R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/12B6FB71-BCAA-416D-B151-099761804DD6"><gtr:id>12B6FB71-BCAA-416D-B151-099761804DD6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Growing old Gracefully?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/609cf2d69e3854fdf67e1f37f0fa8bf1"><gtr:id>609cf2d69e3854fdf67e1f37f0fa8bf1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Douglas-Jones R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/23E80728-CA32-4A8C-A3F2-7743EC49982C"><gtr:id>23E80728-CA32-4A8C-A3F2-7743EC49982C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Materiality, authenticity and value in the historic environment: a study of the effects of material transformation and scientific intervention</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/609cf2d69e3854fdf67e1f37f0fa8bf1"><gtr:id>609cf2d69e3854fdf67e1f37f0fa8bf1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Douglas-Jones R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/183158A1-AB35-4918-ACEF-11610CBF1C5C"><gtr:id>183158A1-AB35-4918-ACEF-11610CBF1C5C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Materiality, Authenticity and Value in the Historic Environment: A Study of The Effects of Material Transformation and Scientific Intervention</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>AHRC/EPSRC SCIENCE AND HERITAGE PROGRAMME ?
