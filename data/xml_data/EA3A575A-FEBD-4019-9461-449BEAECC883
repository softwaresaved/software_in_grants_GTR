&lt;p>It compares the performance of family businesses which participate in a clientelistic network with that of others unengaged in such relations. Crucial to the analysis are the reasons found for high or low, stable or fluctuated performance of family businesses, and social reproduction or decline of business families over the post-war period and how both contribute to the growth of the Scottish economy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study triangulates archival work in Companies House with findings from five key-informant interviews, oral history interviewing of thirty Edinburgh-based family businesses and three case studies of business families.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study seeks to investigate the extent of the emergence of a new type of clientelism in the post-industrial business family context performing an important function in the flow of societal resources and building a structural advantage across the lifecourse of family businesses. It also aims to offer an understanding of how new family relationships affect family business performance and to add to the debate on the competitiveness of family business in a global economy.&lt;/p>

It illustrated how the post-industrialisation period strengthens a 'working class' sense of family business responsibility and practical assistance giving for their own kin, cumulating to an 'enterprising' rather than 'welfare' network of blood relatives (business families of class origin). It also showed how post-industrial family business owners' destinations, such as high growth networks, enact their elite interest-driven use of 'family' as an ideology (business families of class destination). Moreover, it presented trade networks as providers of collective help towards improving their family business members' market share position (business families of class neutrality). The study was thus part of a qualitative approach that broadened understanding of what goes on in inter-firm networks over time (content and function of a tie) instead of focusing on the structural features of networks such as density, frequency of contact or size.

It also addressed wider debates about clientelism which was conventionally seen as a macro explanation of backwardness and underdevelopment in the political economy literature. By contrast, the study's micro-exploration of the evolving concept of clientelism in the British post-industrial family business context demonstrated that it is no longer an exemplar of an illegitimate reciprocity but rather structures the flow of resources and interpersonal exchange within the family business; thus the focus of such patron-client relationships was shown to have become managerial and on the grassroots workings of individual organizations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The socio-economic impact of this work has come through sustained engagement with research users including family businesses, family business associations, policy makers, business advisors, practitioners and the media. In producing and disseminating new empirical knowledge about the working class origin of entrepreneurial business families, the research also helped to qualify widely held assumptions that uncritically see family enterprising as a route to social mobility. This new knowledge may make social and business policy makers think twice before offering family business support purely based on the circumstances of the 'receiving' groups without taking into account their 'cultures of giving'.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CD8ECA0A-6D49-4D49-9D15-585A299845E3</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/94E60CF0-473C-47B3-B8B2-6B2765273B97"><gtr:id>94E60CF0-473C-47B3-B8B2-6B2765273B97</gtr:id><gtr:title>Business Families: A Working Class Institution?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/39f6a11d2cf562773bde59baed35f7ae"><gtr:id>39f6a11d2cf562773bde59baed35f7ae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bika Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2A45856E-AEE2-4D6C-8E4B-584AAAA00E55"><gtr:id>2A45856E-AEE2-4D6C-8E4B-584AAAA00E55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Against the Norm: The Transitional Symbiosis of 'Grassroots Clientelism' and 'Rural Citizenship'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Sociological Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/39f6a11d2cf562773bde59baed35f7ae"><gtr:id>39f6a11d2cf562773bde59baed35f7ae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bika Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CDD571AF-C4E1-41B3-A327-672F02681E14"><gtr:id>CDD571AF-C4E1-41B3-A327-672F02681E14</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Territorial Impact of the European 'Family Firm Life Cycle'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/39f6a11d2cf562773bde59baed35f7ae"><gtr:id>39f6a11d2cf562773bde59baed35f7ae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bika Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B562FA28-40EE-41A4-BAAE-8C7404E67E1E"><gtr:id>B562FA28-40EE-41A4-BAAE-8C7404E67E1E</gtr:id><gtr:title>From Community to Family Values: Elite Networks and Family Business Ideology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/39f6a11d2cf562773bde59baed35f7ae"><gtr:id>39f6a11d2cf562773bde59baed35f7ae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bika Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6ABB06A8-0353-4A48-BFCE-496B97AEA521"><gtr:id>6ABB06A8-0353-4A48-BFCE-496B97AEA521</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transmission or re-socialization?
