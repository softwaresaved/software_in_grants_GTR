The empire was created and sustained by the violence of soldiers, yet this is often glossed over by those who celebrate the benefits of Roman imperialism, Equally, the realities of the sword are commonly sanitised by military specialists, who tend to focus either on the intricacies of unit organization and frontier systems, or think in idealised terms of 'The Roman Army: war machine', Here the military tends to be treated as a shiny mechanism in a glass box, effectively isolated both from wider Roman society, and even from its antagonists. 
Rome and the Sword seeks to address these shortcomings, initially by foregrounding the sword itself, The book will examine weapons, what they did to people, how, by whom they were wielded, why, and with what wider consequences, Material evidence will be prominent, including skeletal trauma, In contrast to much modern warfare, martial violence was highly personal, comprising face-to-face acts of muscle-powered physical mayhem, Outcomes of conflicts were cumulative consequences of such intimate lethal encounters, To deepen our understanding of what soldiers did-and how they could do it-the book will draw on disciplines ranging from archaeology and ancient history to military history, anthropology, military psychology and sociology to help us understand the mentalities of soldiers and warriors. 
It will also rethink our conceptual framework for dealing with the sword, For example, the wars which carved out the Roman empire cost millions of lives, yet they accounted for only part of the violence meted out by soldiers, Equally significant was 'internal' action: armed oppression of civilians and suppression of resistance, 'Warfare' fails to encompass, all these grim activities; 'martial violence' is a better term for what soldiers were about. 
Centrally, the book attacks the profoundly misleading notion of 'The Roman Army: war machine', Baldly, 'The Roman Army' did not exist: Romans themselves lacked a term equivalent to this modern phrase, because no such monolithic institution existed, They spoke instead of multiple armies, of regiments and, tellingly, of millets, 'the soldiers', Martial violence was dealt not by unthinking cogs, but by men for whom issues of emotion, morale, motivation and ambition were all-important. Soldiers cannot be understood in isolation, but only in the context of their interactions with particular antagonists, and as part of wider Roman society.
The soldiers were also in constant interaction with the warriors of neighbouring societies, in conflict but also through recruitment and mutual imitation, Armed men either side of the frontiers constantly reforged each other's identities in war and alliance; we cannot understand Roman soldiers without considering Gauls and Pannonians, Germans and Parthians. 
Considering the Roman military in Roman rather than modern terms reveals another fundamental truth about 'the soldiers', rendered invisible when they are regarded as cogs in a war-machine, They were often as dangerous to other Romans, not least their own commanders, as to foreign enemies, Rome's famous military discipline was startlingly limited; highly trained, highly motivated and proud, Roman soldiers were also unruly, sometimes murderously mutinous, Their commanders struggled to control them, by rhetoric and persuasion, ritual and bribery, as much as by fear of punishment. 
Rome &amp;amp; the Sword will put the brutality of Roman power back on the agenda-but it will also put it into historical context and seek to reassess its role in Roman civilization, It will explore the implications of martial violence, from the chaos, misery and destruction it left in its wake to its paradoxical constructive and constitutive aspects, For the sword was not simply destructive; it was also central to the creation, definition and maintenance of Roman and other identities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26068</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E504280/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology of Literate Soc.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
