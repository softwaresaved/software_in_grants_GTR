It has been shown that hypertensive people have a high risk of stroke, heart attack, heart failure and renal failure. The Health Survey for England in 2006 demonstrated that the prevalence of hypertension in the UK increased from 17% in the age group 40-49 years to 77% in those aged 70-79 years [2]. 

Hypertensive patients are usually identified by a threshold diagnosis of their systolic or diastolic pressures exceeding 140 or 90 mmHg respectively. However this diagnosis tends to misdiagnose the individuals in the large population in and around the threshold making the selection for appropriate therapy difficult. For example one important determinant of hypertension is the flexibility of the aorta (the first artery leading from the heart), which becomes stiffer with age and arteriosclerosis. However, such &amp;quot;stiffness&amp;quot; is only one among other geometrical and mechanical factors that influence the pressure pulse and thus hypertension. Therefore, non-invasive measurement of pulse pressure waveforms has been of interest for more than 100 years, and includes tonometry, Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Although the non-invasive measurement of waveforms has become fast, the current analysis of the measured waveform data is relatively simplistic. In particular, the analysis of certain waveform features are performed in isolation and are impeded by a lack of understanding of the relative contributions from arterial stiffness/geometry, wave reflection and ventricular/arterial interaction to hypertensive pressure. Over the last two decades, computational modelling has been established as a new discipline to study the interaction of different parameters in the cardiovascular system. These models can help to separate the various contributions to the pressure waveform and elucidate complex interaction of parameters affecting hypertension. More recently, imaging data of the patient's anatomy and physiology has been introduced in numerical simulations to produce patient-specific models. Although, different models have been developed to investigate the influence of geometrical and mechanical factors, a model validation remains challenging since it would require large studies in animals and patients. 

This proposal aims at the identification of high-risk individuals by determining the mechanical factors which cause their pressure to be pathological. This approach would allow a better selection of appropriate treatments for the individual patient. For this, we propose the construction of a comprehensive experimental arterial model with which to determine and quantify main contributors to hypertensive pressure as well as to validate our existing computational arterial simulation frameworks (1D and 3D). Translation of these technologies towards the clinic will be facilitated with the construction of full-scale silicone arterial model, which will experimentally simulate haemodynamics of a hypertensive patient dataset. This will be followed by a clinical validation of a computational analysis tools in volunteers and a small patient cohort.

For this, we will develop novel experimental and numerical models of the aorta using medical measurements (e.g. imaging and pressure). The proposed project has a strong focus on clinical translation of biomedical engineering techniques by exploiting our existing academic and clinical network. Furthermore, we will investigate different pathways to impact of research results for different beneficiaries:

1. Hypertensive patients are usually identified by a threshold diagnosis, based normally on their systolic or diastolic pressures exceeding 140 or 90 mmHg respectively. Advice for these thresholds are based on large population studies such as the HOT study [1] rather than individual assessments. However such a pressure threshold diagnosis creates a substantial grey area of subjects within and around these values, and does not identify the individual causes of hypertension making the selection of an appropriate therapy difficult. This proposal aims to identify high-risk individuals and the determining mechanical factors, which cause their pressure to be pathological allowing better selection of appropriate treatments for the individual patient. 

2. Socio-Economic. Despite progress in recent years in the prevention, detection, and treatment of high blood pressure, hypertension remains an important public health challenge. Hypertension affects approximately 1 billion people worldwide and contributes to approximately 50% of all cardiovascular deaths, (estimated 8 million deaths/year worldwide). The American Heart Association estimated the direct and indirect costs of high blood pressure in 2010 as $76.6 billion [2]. In the UK, the clinical management of hypertension is one of the most common interventions in primary care, accounting for approximately &amp;pound;1 billion in drug costs alone in 2006 [NICE clinicl guideline 127- Hypertension]. Our project aims to develop tools to identify those patients who would benefit from drug treatments. 

3. NHS. Our project aims at assessment through data integration of different clinical measurements using a computational model. The NHS would greatly benefit from a more a patient specific approach to reduce the number of hospital visits and to increase the overall success of treatments.

4. Industry. The demonstration of clinical feasibility of data integration with computational modelling tool has a high potential for commercialization. In addition, the application of the experimental model could be of great interest for device companies to develop and test new devices. The well-defined haemodynamic environment could be also of high benefit for medical diagnostic companies to test the accuracy and reproducibility of haemodynamic waveform measurements.

5. Academia. The UK has a leading international position in clinical research and medical imaging. Over the last decade tremendous achievements in computational modelling were made to describe haemodynamics with an integrative biophysical theory. Our project avoids the extensive use of animal models to study the different contributors and thus follows the NC3R-guidelines. Furthermore, our proposed experimental model can replace partly expensive, and ethically involved animal models in haemodynamic research. Our project will further strengthen and expand the position of UK academia both in biomedical engineering and medicine.

We have designed and built a 1:1 scale cardiovascular simulator rig for validation of different biophysical models and assessment of the main contributors to the healthy/hypertensive pressure waveform through incremental parameter adjustments (WP1). Furthermore, we have produced a computational analysis tool to accurately simulate and analyse blood flow and pressure pulse waveforms in the aorta and other large systemic arteries under normal physiological conditions and with hypertension (WP2). We have tested our new computational framework by comparison against analytical, in vitro and in vivo data.

Using our computational and in vitro tools of blood flow modelling in combination with our novel pulse wave analysis tools, we have uncovered physical contributors to hypertension: theoretically using computational simulations; in vitro using the cardiovascular simulator rig produced during the project; and in vivo in hypertensive patients and controls. We also developed and tested algorithms to infer properties relevant for the study of hypertension that cannot be directly measured in the clinic; e.g. aortic stiffness and non-invasive aortic blood pressure.

An important outcome of this project has been the creation of a population of thousands of virtual (computed) subjects, each with distinctive pulse waveforms. For each subject, blood pressure, blood flow and luminal area waveforms are available at multiple arterial locations, together with anatomical and structural properties (e.g. vessel geometries, vessel wall stiffness), which can be calculated from the parameters of the simulation. The population enables us to test and develop pulse wave analysis tools for the assessment of cardiovascular function. It provides a cost-effective initial step to identify those tools that are more likely to be found clinically relevant when carrying out more expensive and time- consuming testing and development using clinical data. Our virtual approach has been proven to be very useful to develop indices of aortic stiffness/compliance and algorithms for the non-invasive estimation of central blood pressure - which are both very important to assess hypertensive patients - and to uncover the main physical contributors to hypertension. We have made available the complete population to the research community (http://haemod.uk/virtual-database).

Although the project focuses on the important application of hypertension, we have used the cardiovascular simulator rig to study other clinically relevant problems, including aortic coarctation and aortic dissection problems. Furthermore, the in vitro model has been used for training and teaching of BEng and clinical students through lab projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The cardiovascular simulator rig of the aorta and larger branches could be adapted to simulate blood flow in other parts of the circulation; e.g. in the pulmonary arteries. The in vitro model can be used to validate different biophysical models, different imaging and data analysis techniques, to evaluate the design and testing of existing and new interventional devices (e.g. catheters, stents), and for training and teaching of students. Our current in vitro model of the systemic circulation is being used for a BEng student lab-project (part of the Fluids module lead by the PI at King's College London).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>41FF2024-52C4-443C-AB74-64F0B4AB2BA4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://haemod.uk/virtual-database</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/36447CE4-6B47-45AC-A83C-B48E9B3CE756"><gtr:id>36447CE4-6B47-45AC-A83C-B48E9B3CE756</gtr:id><gtr:title>A database of virtual healthy subjects to assess the accuracy of foot-to-foot pulse wave velocities for estimation of aortic stiffness.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of physiology.
