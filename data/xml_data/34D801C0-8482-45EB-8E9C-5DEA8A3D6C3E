These fires were associated with a prolonged period of unusually warm and dry weather that led to flammable vegetation, dry peat soils and the potential for severe ecological impacts. Wildfires can cause significant damage to ecosystem function, particularly in areas of high severity where ground-level layers of moss and peat deposits are extensively heated or ignited. Smouldering combustion in layers of peat releases significant amounts of fossil carbon and can have a profound effect on total UK emmissions. Smoulering and extensive soil heating also destroys belowground plant structures and soil seedbanks leading to fundamental changes in patterns of plant and wildlife biodiversity, the loss of moorland habitats and a potential imbalance between the carbon lost from burnt vegetation and that which can be sequesterd by regeneration. Severe fires are also associated with a range of other environmental impacts such as increased soil erosion. Despite the serious environmental consequences of such impacts, almost all of the scientific knowledge of the impacts of moorland wildfires comes from a single event some 35 years ago. There is increasing concern about potential feedbacks between climate, fire frequency, fire severity and carbon fluxes from peatlands. For this reason there is an urgent need to ensure we develop sustainable management practices with regards to moorland biodiversity and carbon stores. This research will play an important role in beginning to fill this fundamental knowledge gap on the impacts of wildfires on UK moorlands. We will visit and assess the immediate impact of recent severe wildfires across the UK, and collect data to allow an initial comparison to be made of the effects of varying burn severities on the above and below ground carbon balance and ecosystem functioning of moorlands. We will map the perimeter of recent wildfires and the distribution of broad classes of fire severity. In areas of differing severity we will make estimates of the total amount of carbon lost from the system due to combustion and assess differences in vegetation regeneration and carbon fluxes from peat in burnt and unburnt plots. By establishing a network of permanent plots, the project will also create a valuable scientific resource that will allow us to track ecosystem change over time and provide a focus for future research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is a broad consensus among fire scientists and land-managers that there is a research gap relating to fire, biodiversity and carbon cycling in moorlands on peat soils. This community engages both non-academic and academic stakeholders to address fire issues, and as such, is helping to drive science and address societal needs in tandem. Our pathways to impact will therefore address both non-academic and academic stakeholders simultaneously and aims to involve as many of these groups as possible. 

The beneficiaries of the research include: members of the fire service, natural resource managers, statutory agencies, government policy makers, non-governmental organisations, the game industry and researchers of climate, biogeochemistry, and ecology. We are fortunate in having a well developed network of contacts in the fire science community (e.g. both PI and Co-I were involved in the 'FIRES' ESRC/NERC Transdisciplinary Research Seminars) and will seek to exploit these links.

Apart from the impacts to biodiversity and carbon cycling, there is also a financial cost associated with extinguishing wildfires, with productivity lost as a result of these burns and a cost associated with restoring burnt areas. This research will contribute to the understanding of the processes involved in wildfire events and has the potential to identify mitigating effects thus helping to reduce costs to fire services and land-managers. This research will provide societal benefits, contribute to the evidence base, and help in the formulation of policy and best practice by providing data on:
1. How fire management and wildfire influence the capacity for moorlands to sequester C and mitigate climate change.
2. Whether wildfire in moorlands decreases or increases biodiversity.
3. Whether managed fire can be used to mitigate increased severe wildfire risk due to climate change
4. The impacts of fire on moorland biodiversity and C cycling.
5. Fire regulating processes. 
6. GHG fluxes in relation to fire.
The project will also provide a geo-referenced resource for scientists to quantify future vegetation succession and carbon cycling.

We will share and disseminate our findings through a range of mechanisms and activities, including:
1. Already established mechanisms e.g. Scottish and English Wildfire Forums, FireBeaters etc. that consists of key stakeholders (e.g. Fire service, land managers, SNH, NE, Forest Research, GCWT, DEFRA, SEPA and representatives of local community organisations). 
2. Use established interactive websites e.g. FireBeaters; which can host data, a calendar of events, news highlights of key findings, and an interactive forum.
3. Wide circulation of research findings in the format of a summary for policymakers
4. Periodic review meetings; to facilitate on-going communication among end-users and investigators.
5. Presentation at national and international conferences and seminars to disseminate our findings to a broad, multidisciplinary group (non-academic and academic).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51865</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Knowledge for Wildfire talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15BF61A9-A9CD-4E10-86BB-77189851EFD2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion and debate with a wide range of stakeholders relevant to peatland fire management

Our work has, however, been presented a number of scientific and stakeholder events and has attracted considerable interest. This has led to the PI being invited to give keynote addresses at recent and forthcoming conferences. The Project PI has also been invited to usse his expertise to help inform the on-going review of prescribed burning regulations in Scotland as well as to provide advice and input to the work of the Scottish, and England and Wales, Wildfire forums. Research on peatland carbon dynamics in response to wildfire is at a comparatively early stage globally and the work stemming from this project has attracted international interest. We anticipate that our work will continue to inform attitudes to the sustainable use of fire on peatlands and the importance of managing fire impacts with respect to the carbon cycle. Nationally the work helps oush forward the argument that a system to forecast the potential for damaging wildfires could be developed with only moderate research investment.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A6B0B17E-6FC0-4498-8FDF-6B8673CEE0B3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We surveyed the environmental consequences of six recent peatland wildfires. We developed a semi-quantitative methology that allowed us to assess fire severity after the event. 

Fire severity varied significantly both within and between individual fires. Interestingly average severity varied up to two-fold between fires but as much as three-fold within some fires. 

There was a significant degree of variation in fuel consumption. Consumption varied significantly between plots within fires but there was limited evidence of a significance difference in average consumption between fires.

Substantial differences were recorded in average soil temperature between burnt and unburnt plots. Day-night temperature fluctuations in burnt plots were frequently more than twice that seen in unburnt plots. This has significant implications for modelling the lostt of carbon from peatland soils.

Both carbon dioxoide and methane production were noticeably different between burnt and unburnt plots but substantial differences also existed between different fires. Methane fluxes were consistently lower on burnt sites whilst carbon dioxide fluxes were generally higher.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Intense fire behaviour in the shrub and grass fuels that dominate the British uplands has distracted attention from what appears to be the critical issue ? the structure and moisture content of ground fuels. Our work lends support to suggestions that a useful wildland fire dangaer rating system, that forecasts the potential for damaging wildfires, could be developed if models of fuel moisture content can be developed. Such models do already exist and would only need adjustment/ground-truthing for use in peatland conditions</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E6158EAC-2651-4B2F-A2CE-95655462418C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://fireregimes.org.uk/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Review of Muirburn guidelines</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A828F608-9C5F-47CC-BBE0-73506E165B0B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have provided evidence to the Scottish-government's on-going review or prescribed burnign regulations.
