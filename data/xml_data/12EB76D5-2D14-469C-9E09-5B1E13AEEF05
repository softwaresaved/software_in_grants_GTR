From Philip Pullman to Doctor Who, readers and viewers of all ages have become attuned to the idea of other worlds almost like our own, but crucially different. Often this takes the form of 'alternate history', where a particular event is imagined to have gone differently, creating a new timeline. The idea has appeared not only in fantasy and science-fiction, but also in mainstream fiction and cinema, with examples such as Philip Roth's The Plot Against America and the movie Sliding Doors.\n\nModern science appears to offer evidence that these worlds really exist. Physicists including Paul Davies and Michio Kaku have published popular books describing how quantum mechanics and superstring theory imply our observable universe is only a tiny part of a far richer 'multiverse', where every possibility becomes actual. Cosmologist Max Tegmark has discussed 'quantum suicide', a version of the famous Schr&amp;ouml;dinger Cat thought-experiment in which the experimenter takes the place of the animal. Since one's own death can never be observed, it is argued, the only possible result is a universe where one survives. Such speculations sound like plotlines from Jorge Luis Borges or Philip K Dick.\n\nHas science influenced art, or has it been the other way round? This research will explore the history and philosophy of multiple realities through the composition of a novel of ideas.\n\nSurprisingly, the idea of parallel worlds was put forward in the nineteenth century, in Louis-Auguste Blanqui's L'Eternite par les astres (1872). Blanqui used the theory of atomic elements to argue there must be planets where, for instance, Napoleon won the Battle of Waterloo. A communist who spent most of his life in prison for revolutionary conspiracies, Blanqui also speculated on worlds where he was free.\n\nPhysicists completely ignored Blanqui's pseudo-scientific work, but it is remembered thanks to Walter Benjamin, who rediscovered it in the 1930s.Benjamin considered Blanqui's cosmology a manifestation of the bourgeois society he fought against. Capitalism views the world as a casino; the multiverse is a 'phantasmogoria' where everyone can be a winner. In the popular writings of present-day physicists such as Stephen Hawking, metaphors of gambling and winning arise frequently.\n\nThe proposed novel will feature Benjamin as a character, but more importantly, it will reflect on his theories of culture, art and history. Through multiple storylines in several historical periods, the novel will explore how ancient ideas of plurality, found in Plato and revived by Leibniz, have been reinterpreted over the ages. In real life, Blanqui was involved in a masonic secret society (the charbonnerie), while Benjamin was deeply drawn to mystical and esoteric thought. The novel will imagine a secret society whose version of 'quantum suicide' leads them to carry out acts of terrorism. Benjamin committed suicide in 1940 rather than face arrest by the Gestapo. The theory he discussed extensively in his Arcades Project was one that implied his own survival, in another world if not this one.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>When scientific ideas are given creative form they can engage a wide public. The output will be a mainstream adult literary novel rather than a work of genre fiction. Thus the main intended beneficiaries of this research are members of the general reading public with some interest in scientific and philosophical ideas, but not necessarily with any specialist knowledge, who will benefit through experiencing the representation of these ideas in an accessible and artistically innovative way.\n\nMeasurable benefit will take both commercial and non-commercial form, and can be realistically expected on the basis of my previous track record as a novelist. Specific beneficiaries outside the field of academic creative writing are:\n\nNon-academic creative writers (particularly novelists);\nAcademics outside creative writing (particularly physicists);\nWorkers and consumers involved with public-sector outreach (libraries and festivals);\nWorkers and consumers involved with the publishing, bookselling, and media industries.\n\nAs the novel is not intended to be 'commercial' in the publishing sense, but rather a work of literary fiction, its most significant impact will be the non-commercial contribution it makes to the UK's culture ecosystem. This will arise through production of an art work that adds to the national store of cultural heritage; through public engagement; and through professional reflection on artistic and intellectual heritage (specifically through the application of philosophical ideas to creative practise). A measure of this impact will be citation, not only academically but in the media, and in wider public discourse.\n\nPublic engagement will take place before and after publication. During the time of the research project I shall organise, under the auspices of the Newcastle Centre for the Literary Arts (NCLA), an event about science and literature, aimed at a general audience. I will present my work in progress and seek participation from writers and scientists in order to generate cross-disciplinary dialogue. I have previously been involved in a number of such events, including international conferences, and am in contact with various distinguished workers who could be approached to participate. The NCLA already hosts a website Scitalk which, as well as providing a database, promotes events and discussions about science and literature which both scientists and writers attend. Target beneficiaries will additionally be reached through posters and other off-line advertising.\n\nI shall maintain a blog during the research project, and selected material generated in the course of the project (both written and live) will be preserved as part of the NCLA digital archive.\n\nI will appear at other literary and science events (festivals and inter-disciplinary conferences) nationally and internationally, and will actively promote my work to a wider audience. I will make broadcast media appearances, and the novel, when published, will receive press coverage through reviews, author interviews and commissioned articles. Like my previous novels, it will be widely available in public libraries, its impact measurable through PLR.\n\nCommercial benefit to the UK economy will be through the publication, distribution and promotion of the novel, both within the UK and abroad. My previous novels have been well promoted in bookshops, widely translated, and nominated for major prizes including the Man Booker. There will be similar measurable commercial exploitation of the proposed novel, aimed at ensuring it reaches the widest possible audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>13224</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I published a novel (The Secret Knowledge, Dedalus 2013) and hosted a one-day public event &amp;quot;Parallel Worlds&amp;quot; at the Centre For Life, Newcastle on 1 October 2010</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6F58FF31-39D2-47C8-9A9C-FDDFACE59FBA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project resulted in the composition of a novel, The Secret Knowledge (Dedalus 2013).

This objective was achieved. I intend to carry these ideas further forward in a subsequent novel.
