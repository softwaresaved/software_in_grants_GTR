Despite this, bacteria still cause around six millions deaths/year in humans and many more in animals, with people in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) disproportionately affected. Worryingly, as anti-microbial resistance (AMR) increases, the number of deaths from infection will rise with devastating personal and economic consequences. One reason bacteria can cause so much harm is because there are many different diseases caused by bacteria for which there is either no vaccine or the existing vaccine does not provide complete protection. New vaccines against bacterial infections will help people in all countries, but most prominently in LMICs. Unfortunately, there are many barriers that currently prevent such vaccines from being developed. These barriers can be for scientific reasons, such as what to put in the vaccine, or economic issues, such as neglect due to lack of commercial viability. To help overcome these barriers and deliver new vaccines to where they are needed, a network is needed that enables scientists, clinicians and companies from around the world to come together and share their skills and knowledge.

This is what the 'BactiVac' bacterial vaccinology network for human and animal vaccines will achieve. The network will be centred in the UK, harnessing the considerable strength already present in the UK in disciplines related to bacterial vaccinology, including immunology, epidemiology, systems biology, clinical trials and support for vaccine licensure. Crucially, the network will build on and foster new partnerships with LMICs, with industry, and manufacturers in developing countries. BactiVac will support bacterial vaccine development from when the idea is conceived to when it is licensed for use in humans or animals, particularly helping at those points where most potential vaccines flounder.

The network will achieve these ambitions by combining a number of approaches.

1. The network will identify which diseases in LMICs caused by bacteria should be prioritised and how the broad vaccine community can be helped to make new vaccines that prevent them. 

2. We will provide training grants, particularly for members from LMICs, to learn the skills needed to grow the research and industrial base in vaccinology. 

3. By interconnecting the diverse experience and skills within the membership, we will facilitate new partnerships and sharing of information, supported by the creation of a member directory, a BactiVac website and regular newsfeeds, along with an annual networking meeting. 

4. To encourage these new partnerships, the network will support small scale 'catalyst' projects through an open annual competition. These projects will grow new areas and partnerships to encourage larger scale funding, accelerate vaccine development and to help overcome the bottlenecks that prevent vaccines going from an idea to a product.

5. Underpinning all of these focused activities BactiVac will provide an advocacy programme that promotes the importance, need and value of vaccines to bacterial infections. This programme will work with the general public, governments and ministries of health, and non-governmental organisations, including key stake-holders in global health policy, such as the WHO and other funding organisations.

Collectively, this will lead to a growth in research and development of new vaccines against bacterial infections and improve lives across the world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Bacterial infections are major contributors to the global burden of disease among humans and animals in LMICs, hampering development. They are particularly problematic where diagnostic facilities are lacking, and treatments are increasingly compromised by the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. Prevention through vaccination is an efficient and cost-effective strategy, but for many bacterial infections, no suitable vaccine is available. A network that champions bacterial vaccinology has the transforming potential to advance bacterial vaccines for LMICs, save lives and promote economic growth. Such a network does not currently exist and is needed now. The network will complement the active and strong support already present for viral outbreak pathogens through the 'UK Vaccines Network' and WHO 'R&amp;amp;D Roadmap' and 'CEPI' initiatives.

BactiVac seeks to redress the current imbalance in global vaccinology, with its vision to facilitate end-to-end LMIC human and animal bacterial vaccine development. It will focus on the transition of promising vaccines from preclinical studies to clinical trials, where many flounder. Bringing together diverse parties with expertise in complementary aspects of bacterial vaccinology and a strong emphasis on LMIC and industry involvement, will help galvanise the community, foster new partnership and disseminate key relevant information. This will be supported by a members directory, website, newsfeeds and annual meetings. Two landscape scoping exercises will assess LMIC priority bacterial diseases for vaccine development and industrial capacities to support translation and clinical development of these vaccines. Catalyst funding will support innovative bacterial vaccine R&amp;amp;D projects and partnerships, and training opportunities to transfer vaccinology skills to LMICs. The network will serves as a global voice for bacterial vaccinology through advocacy initiatives targeting ministries of health and global health policy makers and funders.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. LMIC impact
a) Country-wide
The chief beneficiaries of BactiVac are the LMICs where the vaccines, whose development has been supported by the network, will be deployed. Since the network encompasses human and animal bacterial vaccines, the benefit will be to human health through reduced disease morbidity and mortality, and improved food security, with economic development as the end result. This benefit will be felt at the level of the individual, community and country, both in relation to health and economic benefit, as improved health is key to driving development.

b) Priority transformation
Given that a new vaccine takes around 10 years to develop and costs a minimum of $800 million (MacLennan CA and Saul A; PNAS 2013), the full benefit from the network will not just be through direct bacterial vaccine R&amp;amp;D support, but by a change in overall global health culture and positioning of LMIC bacterial vaccine development in the global landscape. This will depend on establishing an effective global presence and voice, and successfully advocating on behalf of bacterial vaccinology. Hence, the BactiVac network can potentially serve a transformational role to effect change in prevailing global vaccine prioritisation and investment to a position that fully encompasses bacterial and more endemic diseases.

Manufacturing
A more immediate LMIC economic impact will be the expansion of vaccine manufacturing capacity, resulting from successful transitioning of new vaccines into clinical development. Developing country vaccine manufacturers are well placed to take on new vaccines that have been de-risked by transition through to successful clinical proof of concept (e.g. tech transfer of bivalent typhoid/paratyphoid A glycoconjugate vaccine from Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health to Biological E, India in 2014). Since this is the vaccine pipeline focus area of BactiVac, an increased number of vaccines should move through to clinical development.

Research Capacity Building
With a strong focus on LMIC involvement in all aspects of BactiVac and prioritisation of 'catalyst: project' and 'catalyst: training' activities to LMICs, a direct impact will be capacity building in all areas of vaccinology in LMICs. This will include support of epidemiology, disease biology and clinical trials activity. An ethos of LMIC member involvement from the earliest stages of vaccine development will help ensure the voice of the vaccines end-users is heard and that they are involved in the vaccine development pathway from the outset.

High Income Country (HIC) impact
Although BactiVac is targeted at LMIC bacterial vaccine R&amp;amp;D, it is conceivable that the normal paradigm of vaccines being developed first for HIC and deployed years later in LMICs may be reversed, allowing HICs to become secondary beneficiaries of these vaccines. This is likely to be especially the case in relation to the travel vaccine market.

All network members
As well as helping LMICs through facilitating LMIC product development, BactiVac will have positive impact among all network members through connecting them to potential partners, disseminating key information, pump-priming pilot studies, supporting training and advocacy measures outlined above. As a successful network, BactiVac would help facilitate the growth of R&amp;amp;D capacity and know-how throughout the network, attract support from funders beyond the MRC, in addition to accelerating vaccines along the R&amp;amp;D pipeline.

Widening research in vaccinology
BactiVac will maintain an open membership stance and outward facing presence to scientists and others in allied fields who may not have considered previously applying their expertise to vaccinology. The impact of this will be to draw new members into the network, thereby increasing the critical mass of expertise available to drive vaccine R&amp;amp;D.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2035787</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R005974/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>D8F3A27D-084A-40BB-A046-087DACE23410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.4  Vaccines</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
