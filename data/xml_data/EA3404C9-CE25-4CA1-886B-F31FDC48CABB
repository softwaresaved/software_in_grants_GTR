This project investigates how such consolidation of memories occurs during sleep. In 4 studies participants will keep a daily diary and will also produce reports of their dreams, either at home or in the sleep laboratory. How dream content is related to events from waking life will be studied. Incorporations of waking life events into dreams can be literal replications of events, indirect representations, or even metaphors.&lt;br />&lt;br />The timescale of incorporations will be examined, aiming to replicate the dream-lag effect, in which events from 5-7 days before the dream are incorporated as frequently as events from 1-2 days before the dream, with a dip in incorporations on days 3-4. This effect may indicate an approximately week-long memory processing function for sleep. Because Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REM) is thought to be especially important for the consolidation of emotional memories, the project differentiates REM dreams from non-REM dreams, and emotional from neutral memories.&lt;br />&lt;br />The project also tests whether specific experimenter induced experiences are incorporated into dreams in a delayed manner, and uses a direct behavioural test of how memory consolidation occurs across several periods of sleep.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79586</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dream content as a measure of memory consolidation across multiple periods of sleep: First results of ESRC award to M.Blagrove, M.Walker, P.Lewis &amp; G.Gaskell.

Results from 4 successful replications and extensions of the dream-lag effect were described. The dream-lag effect refers to the incorporation into dreams of events and memories from 5-7 days before the dream. The effect has been interpreted as evidence for memory consolidation processes occurring during sleep, and occurring over a 7 day period. At the seminar several novel characteristics of the dream-lag were described, a successful extension to a word learning task was reported, and several alternative theoretical accounts of why the effect happens were explored. Possibly as important as these results is also the finding that an EEG power variable (that is, the strength of certain brain waves occurring during sleep) was significantly related to the number of incorporations of recent events into dreams.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>28000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Portugal, Portuguese Republic</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Bursary</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>BIAL Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>2014/83</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>394ADF7A-BF65-43BE-AA43-90CE763267CF</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The implications of a 5-7 day period of emotional memory consolidation during sleep, and in particular Rapid Eye Movement sleep, are that consistently good sleep is needed for the proper integration of new experiences with older memories. Poor sleep might thus result in a failure to respond adaptively to, and learn from, new emotional occurrences. In publications read by individuals involved in researching the processes of emotional adaptation and also learning we are making clear the impact of our work for optimal learning, which would include education, and adaptive responding to new life circumstances.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4C840057-4E86-4A1C-B72D-2BEC835E07DC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The 'dream-lag' refers to the delayed incorporation of events or memories from waking life into dreams that occur 5-7 days after the events. Although there is widespread acceptance of the day-residue effect, where events or memories from waking life are incorporated into dreams of the next night, the dream-lag effect is less widely accepted, despite recent paper supporting it (Blagrove et al, 2011: Consciousness and Cognition, and PLoS ONE). This research grant funded 4 attempted replications of the dream-lag, one a naturalistic study of daily life and home dreams, one a study of the dream-lag for specifically Rapid Eye Movement Sleep dreams, and 2 studies in which the incorporation of a controlled experience during waking life into the dreams of the next 10 days was assessed. All 4 experiments succeeded in showing a significant dream-lag effect.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Education: Consistent high quality sleep is needed for learners. 

Psychotherapy: Implications for the way, and timescale, that new experiences, including traumatic experiences, are integrated, or fail to be integrated, into the wider memory, and the role of sleep in these processes. These 4 successful experiments are evidence that there is a 7 day period during which memories from waking life are consolidated, that is, made permanent and also integrated into existing long-term memory. This indicates that consistent high quality sleep across the week is needed for effective learning, relating to new knowledge or autobiographical memory.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CC2E46D5-74AF-4E73-9981-9EE4C2311749</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.swansea.ac.uk/sleeplab</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/572AC24E-EDB8-488C-A1A0-95669F18FEF8"><gtr:id>572AC24E-EDB8-488C-A1A0-95669F18FEF8</gtr:id><gtr:title>THE OCCURRENCE OF REFERENCES TO RECENT WAKING LIFE EVENTS IN REM SLEEP DREAMS IS CORRELATED WITH FRONTAL THETA ACTIVITY</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8a9ea31d887b46c9f448d20a0a00f880"><gtr:id>8a9ea31d887b46c9f448d20a0a00f880</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jean-Baptiste Eichenlaub (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8D377160-6AEE-4A50-BA0E-52382D7303D8"><gtr:id>8D377160-6AEE-4A50-BA0E-52382D7303D8</gtr:id><gtr:title>The dream-lag effect: Selective processing of personally significant events during Rapid Eye Movement sleep, but not during Slow Wave Sleep.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neurobiology of learning and memory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f6f816aae8cac4217111df4f3fea1108"><gtr:id>f6f816aae8cac4217111df4f3fea1108</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van Rijn E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1074-7427</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/82350580-9A66-453E-B045-E00A440AEA46"><gtr:id>82350580-9A66-453E-B045-E00A440AEA46</gtr:id><gtr:title>The relative incorporation of waking events, emotional waking events, and current concerns into dreams</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5403eb47ab03b870eafc40371692d8b9"><gtr:id>5403eb47ab03b870eafc40371692d8b9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mark Blagrove (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-4561</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I037555/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
