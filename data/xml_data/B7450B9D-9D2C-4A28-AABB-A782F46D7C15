Uncertainties in the physicochemical properties of pure components and condensed phase mixtures affect our ability to accurately predict and resolve this partitioning. 

How do we tackle such uncertainties? In 2 ongoing NERC grants, a range of fundamental properties of pure components and mixtures (vapour pressures, viscosities and diffusion constants), are being measured with the objective of improving predictions for atmospheric functionalities. Given the urgency of making such measurements, complementary instruments and expertise exists across the EU and North America that is not available through existing NERC projects. Similarly, the laboratory facilities and expertise enabled by the referenced NERC projects are not accessible to such international programmes. 

Why is the lack of coherence in methodology and expertise a problem? Recent reviews by the international community highlight significant discrepancies between experimental methods. Despite this, there is no coordinated effort to reconcile these differences or to start compiling appropriate data, with appropriate screening, to improve the predictive techniques essential for improving atmospheric aerosol models. Current compiled data are extremely sparse. On top of this, there are no recommended standards to establish accepted criteria for future measurements or an agreed set of modelling tools to determine how accurate the data has to be to predict evolving aerosol properties. Ultimately, we do not know what level of accuracy in properties might be attainable and acceptable. This is a unique opportunity to address these issues internationally whilst directly benefiting existing and future NERC driven programmes. 

This IOF will catalyse exploitation of data from ongoing NERC grants, consolidating it into new databases built with measurements and expertise from partner organisation, adding value by expanding flexibility and accuracy of predictive techniques. We have identified 3 ongoing and 2 completed NERC grants as detailed in the case for support. Each partner will provide access to their existing measurement and modelling programmes, involvement in evaluation committee meetings, writing publications, hosting researchers to take part in intercomparisons (see letters of support) and supporting engagement with the wider community once the network matures. 

Whilst we identify activities to take place over a 2-year period, it is crucial to ensure project sustainability. As such, we will not only create new databanks and an agreed set of open source community modelling facilities, but an agreed set of standards for accepting future measurements will be established. We will engage with the global community through open workshops and meetings. The network comprises researchers from: The University of Manchester [lead], University of Bristol [UK-CoI], ETH [Switzerland], Aarhus University [Denmark], Stockholm University [Sweden], Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory [US], Pacific Northwest National Lab [US] and University of British Columbia [Canada].</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Atmospheric aerosol particles are major contributors to both climate forcing uncertainties and adverse effects on human health. Without an improved knowledge of basic data it is not possible to predict effects or simplify and / or parameterise aerosol properties with any degree of certainty. The proposed work targets improvements in those parameters that currently compromise state of the art models of aerosol behaviour. The quantitative improvement in these predictive models will then inform models used to conduct process simulations from single particle to regional scales.

Direct beneficiaries of the immediate work will be largely academic; though results obtained from this project will indirectly benefit policy driven and industrial non-academic end users. The atmospheric community will benefit from provision of a comprehensive set of fundamental property measurements and improved predictive models. Dissemination of knowledge through online software and printed reference material via collaboration with partners will vastly increase our ability to benefit researchers in other fields indirectly, as discussed shortly. The primary non-academic end-users of the proposed programme output in the UK would be the Met Office via existing links with the UKCA Climate- Chemistry-Community-Aerosol model, a joint NCAS-Met Office programme funded by NCAS, GMR and DEFRA. The impacts of aerosol on climate are still credited with the largest uncertainty in climate forcing and a large part of the radiatively active boundary layer sub-micron aerosol burden is organic. Policy decisions with respect to quantification and mitigation of the climate impacts of aerosol require policy-related model simulations with at least a rudimentary but physically-based representation of organic aerosol. Such model descriptions are currently unavailable. The study of those properties which dictate gas/particle partitioning of organic compounds will be able to inform such a climate-focused goal. Other international non-academic agencies conducting IPCC simulations would be best placed to use the same reduced complexity SOA formalisms supplied to the Met Office.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>113724</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N013700/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F78E4567-DD59-4364-9D1F-0A778996E941</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrumentation Eng. &amp; Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98C0D11F-5C27-40CE-A895-54E4C61784B1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technol. for Environ.
