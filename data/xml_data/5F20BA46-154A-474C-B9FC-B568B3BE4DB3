Such a tantalising inscription would have meant very little to a musician or scholar in 1975, but today we know that the instrument referred to is the lirone, that plaintive-sounding multi string bowed intrument most often associated with grief and lamentation. That first encounter with Roman music inspired the rest of my musical life: I have made research trips to the main Italian cities, have collected, transcribed and performed much of the repertoire, and commissioned four copies of original lirones, yet in all my performing and touring as a professional musician in Europe, America and the Far East, I have been repeatedly disappointed that Roman music is still neglected by performers, promoters and recording companies.\n\nThe Roman composers of the generation after Monteverdi, led by Luigi Rossi and Marco Marazzoli, set the intense poetry of their contemporaries - of which martyrdom and death, extravagant repentance, lamenting and religious ecstasy played no small part - and intensified it to create a new musical experience that was sensual, passionate, even erotic. Both Christian and Classical narratives were exploited to put their message across. The new exaggerated and excessive musical style is what we have come to think of as 'Baroque'.\n\nIn 2007 I was awarded an AHRC fellowship which enabled me to research the lirone and its history, playing techniques, repertoire and cultural setting, and to develop projects that would promote the instrument and its remarkable repertoire. For that purpose I formed the ensemble Atalante to explore, rehearse, record, stage and film as much Roman music as possible. In 2009 I was awarded an AHRC small grant to assist with costs towards intensive rehearsal periods for two recordings to ensure optimum artistic results as well as to elucidate important performance-practice questions posed by the repertoire. The grant also supported our staged and filmed depictions of the musical narratives, with sumptuous Caravaggio-style costumes, evocative props and imaginative lighting in atmospheric settings. This made the repertoire far more accessible to the musical public, and worked to reinforce the marketing of the CDs, to promote my ensemble Atalante and to augment the effectiveness of my research and my lirone website. Our first recording (November 2009) was of Roman laments of Artemisia, Helen of Troy, Mary Magdalene and the Blessed Virgin by Rossi and Marazzoli. The second recording (July 2010) was of the Roman oratorio of Santa Caterina, whose original score we reconstructed since it had been damaged.\n\nMy current application for a further AHRC small grant is to showcase the lirone as an important member of the basso continuo family, to continue to expand its repertoire through recordings, concerts, presentations and performing editions, and to transcend language and cultural barriers for listeners through visually illustrated staged versions of the repertoire. A further objective would be to introduce large-scale Latin works for the lirone (Lamento di David by Domenico Mazzocchi) as well as laments from the generation after Rossi and Marazzoli (Alessandro Stradella, Alessandro Scarlatti and Bernardo Pasquini), including a recorded track of Cain's lament to finally enable that remarkable work to see the light of day.\n\nMy strategy in visually enhancing Roman music is modelled on the Counter-Reformation's own marketing tool for spreading their ideology far and wide. Their motto Delectare et docere - to delight while instructing - was created to attract the multitudes back to the Catholic church. The extravagant and erotic music and poetry must have had a powerful effect on its 17th-century listeners, and with visual enhancement, we endeavor to achieve a totally immersible experience for listeners today.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The professional music business is discovering that creative programming with visual enhancement is necessary to make new repertoire accessible and to reach potential listeners. Atalante's staged performances and recordings lead the way; not only are they creating a market for 17th-century Roman music, but they are inspiring other musicians and ensembles to embrace this marvellous repertoire, to use the lirone's unique sonority to advantage and to explore new worlds of continuo sonorities. Ensembles who have commissioned me to build Roman programmes for their own series are the Academy of Ancient Music, the English Concert and Les Arts Florissants.\n\nProfessional, amateur and student musicians will have access to the repertoire and translations through my editions of all the Roman music that we perform and record. Likewise they will benefit from important performance-practice guidance. Techniques for accompanying vocal music, solving figured-bass problems, mixing the continuo palette, approaching 17th-century Italian poetry and more will also be available in my CD booklet notes, performing editions and prefaces, published articles, presentations and web materials.\n\nThere are literally 1000s of vocal manuscripts in the Vatican collections, and scattered amongst them are narrations and laments of ancient heroes and heroines, both secular (Greek, Roman, Persian, Turkish, Egyptian) and religious (Judeo-Christian, Muslim). Surveying and transcribing them has been an arduous but rewarding journey, much like that of the archaeologists who excavated the relics of ancient Rome. Undoubtedly this research will combine well with other arts and disciplines, particularly within academe and the museum and gallery sector.\n\nReaching musicians and audiences is also inevitably accomplished through the media. With the added benefit of filmed stagings, our narratives can be heard and seen through a variety of formats: radio and television broadcasts, internet sites (Internet 2.0/social networking e.g. YouTube, Facebook), on our record company website and on Atalante's, on downloads and on DVD.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32237</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Themes of abandonment, crucifixion, loss, fire and war .

Much feedback came from listening colleagues and from those who had little musical understanding who were amazed of the rich artistic culture of the Roman papal court in the 17th century, particularly the impressive and voluminous repertoire enjoyed by the courtiers and cardinals that appears to be equally as appealing to listeners today.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Il Lirone ed il suo Repertorio</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A02BD74-D5C5-4D88-BDB2-B3B763ED3532</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A lecture given in Italian to scholars and students at the Istituto Superiore di Studi Musicali Rinaldo Franci, Siena. As ever, I needed to provide basic information about the lirone and the period before going into detail. My main purpose in speaking here was to engage Italians in thinking about their own language, and how important it is to consider that vocal music from the 17th century is based on poetry, and not prose. This stirred up some lively discussion during question time, and it was gratifying that the Italians understood well my points about prosody and rhetoric.

The audience were graduate students and professors of music who brought up the point that in Italy, conservatories are not sympathetic to the early music movement, so that lectures and concerts of this kind are extremely welcome and more are needed to transform interest in high quality but little known repertoire.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Lirone from Leonardo da Vinci to the Present</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5DA22664-D424-41AB-B8F5-E22CA56961B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This lecture was given at the Pennsylvania State University (March, 2012) as part of a three-day residency there in which I also coached graduate string students in the art of bowing.

I was gratified by the response that the students and faculty showed in their amazement and appreciation of the beauty of this lost Roman repertoire for the lirone.

A very important connection came from this visit in the form of collaboration with Prof. Marica Tacconi, a specialist in an earlier period of Italian music, but nevertheless most taken by the Roman repertoire that I lectured about and discussed with her. She was the person who contacted Harvard's Villi I Tatti about my work, and I was almost immediately offered the residency.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>80000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Staged performances of Luigi Rossi's Orfeo for the Galway International Festival</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts Council of Ireland</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C07E13F6-ABFD-4CF9-9E24-36156EE12D28</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In addition to continuing concert appearances, we made two more CDs in our series, Reliquie di Roma which benefitted in every way from the research findings that go back to my original fellowship commences in 2007.
