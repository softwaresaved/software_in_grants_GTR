&lt;p>An interdisciplinary research team (social psychology, geography, sociology) will work in collaboration with government and grassroots organisation partners in four different case locations: &lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>a major city&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a large public sector hospital&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;two winners of a UK government local community energy demand reduction competition. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Two main empirical phases of fieldwork will be conducted at each research location. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Phase 1: individual interviews to access peoples' use of energy and energy practices in the different communities. Participants will revisit key moments in their life histories (eg transition to adulthood) and aspects of their everyday life (eg established routines) to prompt awareness of their personal investments in energy use. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Phase 2: an extended period of more in-depth qualitative longitudinal research (supplemented by visual methods) incorporating repeat interviews after a further 5 and 10 months with a subset of participants in each case location. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim is to produce more complex and realistic understandings of how and why individuals' energy biographies develop as they do, and the unintended and intended consequences of energy demand reduction interventions.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>699910</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Wales</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Welsh European Funding Office</gtr:department><gtr:description>FLEXIS collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>88CCD121-695B-4C1E-A4C0-0C42F6220829</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary.

Two of our main collaborating partners are the Climate Psychology Alliance (CPA) and Carbon Conversations (CC) initiative. 

Following a workshop between the Energy Biographies (EBs) team and the Carbon Conversations initiative held in Cardiff, January 2016, Carbon Conversations stated in writing that a number of important findings have been confirmed for them as a result of learning directly about our original energy biographies' data analytic work. Similarly, The Climate Psychology Alliance have been influenced by our work on narratives of energy use and identity transitions, and have recently (June 2016) organised their own event on recovery narratives to reflect on insights from our published analyses. 

Since 2014, a shared understanding and sense of purpose has been built throughout the engagement events in which Energy Biographies, Carbon Conversations, and the Climate Psychology Alliance teams participated. This culminated in a series of email exchanges after our workshop in Cardiff January 2016, where the Carbon Conversations lead expressed an explicit interest in continuing to work with us to develop more flexible means of delivering their own approach, including their specific workshop materials, and to enable members of public to engage more successfully with energy consumption/carbon reduction initiatives/interventions. 

We have further plans for working collaboratively with our partner organisations to find more research informed ways of developing capabilities within communities - and more generally as part of ground-up activities among a broadly conceived public - in managing the significant difficulties in doing that that CC, CPA and EB's have acknowledged. In particular, plans will be developed to mine ideas emerging about how to re-energise Carbon Conversations' efforts as they seek to effect meaningful change. We envisage that Carbon Conversations will work with the energy biographies team as we move into the next phase of our work with engineering colleagues in South and West Wales, as part of Flexis - the Welsh Government/European funded (WEFO) network investigating flexible, integrated energy systems change. 

We have also published a public engagement piece carefully written in a style that combines academic rigour and publishing flair at: https://theconversation.com/using-less-energy-why-do-we-say-one-thing-but-do-another-49610</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6405F5E3-CAC7-4281-B40D-D9A0212038F5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Drawing on areas of particular strength within the UK social sciences, the energy biographies project developed an innovative approach to investigating energy transitions in everyday life. Methodological innovation was a key part of our work (see under 'Research Tools and Methods' for details of our-up-to-date, interactive (and hence engaging) digital, multi-modal and qualitative longitudinal/temporal methods). 

Our energy biographies methods enabled participants to reflect on the invisible, dynamic ways in which they use energy in everyday life across a range of settings (home, work, travel) and in their local communities where demand reduction interventions are in place. Our findings therefore suggest that these methods make it possible to bring into the open a wider range of important issues to which energy researchers have paid insufficient attention in their efforts to expand research and theorising to explain demand trajectories. Such issues include the usually hidden kinds of emotional investments that we make in everyday objects that use energy (washing machines, cars), everyday practices (driving or cycling to work) and the material infrastuctures that provide us with our electricity supplies (see our article published in the journal 'Environmental Values'). 

Our research approach also made it possible to access people's stories about the kinds of changes they experience across their own lifecourse. Analysis of such energy biographies stories has led to some of our publicly reported findings in the journal 'Science, Technology and Human Values'. These findings suggest that assumptions that disruptive transitions in people's lives (such as birth of a child, or moving house) may offer opportunities to change extensively how they use energy may be too optimistic. They point instead to the importance of further temporal and cultural identity dynamics relating, for example, to shared narrative genres, that are involved in creating or obstructing opportunities for change. Changes in energy use and demand are unlikely to be possible if they create concerns for people about their everyday dependencies on energy and a resultant sense of being unable to live out a worthwhile life (e.g. because they cannot keep alive valued identities and desires or sustain their relationships with significant others). 

Overall, our research suggests that energy researchers could benefit more from investigating people as complexly psychological and social subjects. This 'psychosocial' project framing brings out of our data a multiplicity of additional issues, such as having regard for the effort involved when people are seeking to work out what is the best thing to do; how to resolve moral tensions over long-established and/or contemporary values; how difficult it can be to think about a longer-term future based on contemporary ideals of what counts as a life worth living. In our study, we have also reported on the possibilities opened up for critically investigating established guidance for changing energy behaviours and practices, by studying what we have called the 'emotional labour of meaning making' (for a more detailed account of our findings see the full end of grant report at http://energybiographies.org/our-work/our-findings/reports/). 

More broadly, we have started to put in place a platform of ideas, analysis and research resources that will complement ones that are already well established in multi-disciplinary academic and policy research that is currently focussed on generating understanding of how it might be possible to transform the UK's whole energy system. As such, our work is making a specific contribution to efforts towards meeting the UK's international obligations in reducing carbon emissions. It is also part of contemporary and futures-oriented work with and for the public at devolved and national levels, taking into account a wide range of interrelated environmental and societal problems. 

Our platform serves as a means of thickening and diversifying the space of contemporary social research on energy consumption so that demand trajectories can be understood as involving more or less meaningful forms of engagement with how energy is used and its relationship with other environmental problems, that can become invested with deep and complex emotions. This is an important step if we are to be able appreciate the wider cultural affordances of our psychosocial investments in energy and ways of living with and through difficult personal and societal transitions. Approaching issues around energy consumption from this direction changes our understanding of how particular energy using practices affect identity and enrich lives worth living. Psychosocial dimensions of practice can provide the resources for re-imagining energy futures through the everyday, and in particular, for imagining alternative visions of convenience and comfort that are decoupled from overconsumption.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Energy Biographies study has made substantial progress in establishing a distinctive programme of work, with a significant capability to complement the whole systems change perspective that currently leads the direction of UK energy research. There is further work to be done to mesh the significant developments we have made in conducting in depth, psychosocial research on understanding the dynamics of everyday energy use with the whole systems change perspective. Plans are already in place to do this in two main ways. 

First, we are well advanced in terms of our 2015-2016 impact activities to organise a knowledge sharing workshop early in 2016 with the UK-wide Carbon conversations project (www.carbonconversations.org; www.surefoot-effect.com). This project has a significant track record in conducting public group work on how to enable people to contemplate difficult changes in their lives as society adapts to pressures exerted by initiatives to deal with climate change, environmental degradation and decarbonisation.

Second, Energy Biographies II will be part of the work of the Energy Systems Research Institute (ESRI) at Cardiff University. In particular, the Flexis research project (22 million, WEFO funded) will bring together engineering research in Cardiff and a programme of social sciences research by the Cardiff energy biographies research team within the ESRI. The social sciences part of the Flexis programme will additionally be utilising policy specific insights generated by a recent report by two of the energy biographies investigators as part of the Future of Identities research portfolio at the ESRC (see Henwood and Pidgeon, 2012, Foresight evidence report at www.bis.gov/foresight). 

One of the breaking social sciences and energy topics that will be an integral part of the work of Flexis, and that has arisen directly from the work of the energy biographies team (under submission), concerns the implications of our energy biographies work (methods development and findings) within the fields of responsible innovation and technology system assessment. This work is also a key strength of the established work of Dr Chris Groves who has worked as a senior RA on energy biographies since August 2013, and who will continue to work with Henwood and Pidgeon on developing 'Responsible Research and Innovation Frameworks for Emerging and Whole Systems Energy Developments'.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DF5B9B24-9790-4E94-86A6-F03F0F6B1A3E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://energybiographies.org/our-work/our-findings/reports/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>As part of our innovative methodological approach (see also under key findings), we brought together a bespoke set of practical tools and methods suited to meeting our project aims. These were interactive, involved participants using multimodal digital tools, and were temporally organised.

Between interviews, they were asked to undertake activities such as using camera phones, watching film clips about technological change and &amp;quot;future homes&amp;quot;, and sending us their own photographs on different occasions over one year (out of which the research team composed individual photo-narratives to help capture difficult to articulate patterns of energy use).
