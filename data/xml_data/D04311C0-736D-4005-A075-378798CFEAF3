The first 'peace wall' was constructed almost fifty years ago in 1969 to separate the Catholic Falls Road and the Protestant Shankill Road in Belfast. At the time, it was considered a short-term policy intervention. An Army Major, overseeing the construction of the wall said: 'This is a temporary measure... we do not want to see another Berlin wall situation in Western Europe... it will be gone by Christmas'. Despite the successes of the peace process, such segregation and division are still part of the daily reality for many in Northern Ireland. In 2014, that wall still remains and has been accompanied by one hundred additional walls and barriers, stretching to more than 26 miles in length across the city. Indeed, the peace walls have come to symbolize the ongoing gulf between the aspirations of the peace process and the implementation of peace in practice. It is against this backdrop that our knowledge exchange partnership project exists. 

The rationale for our project has been driven by the Northern Ireland government's recently published community relations strategy document, Together: Building a United Community (May 2013) which set itself the ambitious target of removing ALL interface barriers (peace walls) by 2023. However, our previous research has shown that 69% of local residents living in closest proximity to the peace walls believe that the peace walls are still necessary because of the potential for violence. Clearly much works will need to be undertaken with these communities in order for the government to achieve its policy objectives. 

The project will generate extra value in terms of both scholarship and impact by using social science insights to maximise the chances of efficient and effective policy delivery. We will achieve this through direct and sustained engagement with senior policy-makers and practitioners connected to the Northern Ireland Executive's peace walls implementation strategy. By embedding the academic team within the Department of Justice for 12 months, working with their newly established Interface Action Team (IAT) which has lead responsibility for delivery of this strategy, opportunities for efficient and effective policy delivery will be enhanced. A series of research objectives have been identified in partnership with the IAT. These include the design, delivery and analysis of a further public attitudes survey, preliminary research on designing the next steps in practical interventions in interface areas building on existing investments from external funders such as the International Fund for Ireland, conducting a review of existing mechanisms for managing peace walls, and establishing baseline indicators to assist in mapping progress in the implementation of the peace walls initiative over the next 10 years. This will also lead to a series of roundtable workshops with academics and senior civil servants, the establishment of a database which brings together relevant statistical and qualitative information on interface areas and a number of evidence-based policy briefs designed to encourage wider participation and consultation in policy development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? 

This project will use social science insights to maximise the chances of efficient and effective policy delivery in relation to Northern Ireland's current peace walls implementation strategy. Through doing so the project will be of direct benefit to: 
a. Individuals responsible for the strategic and operational delivery of policies within the DOJ (primarily those within the Interface Action Team);
b. Devolved government, particularly the NI Ministers responsible for issues directly and indirectly associated with peace walls;
c. Local government - particularly Belfast City Council;
d. Public sector bodies that engage on issues aligned to the challenges associated with the removal of peace walls including the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the Police Service of Northern Ireland; 
e. Local community and voluntary organisations dealing with these challenges around removing peace walls including Belfast Interface Project, North Belfast interface network, Community Relations Council, Tides Training, Forthspring, and Lower Shankill Community Association.
f. Broader society in Northern Ireland including churches and business.

How will they benefit? 

In the short term this project will increase levels of collaboration between actors and stakeholders across the various sectors identified above (a-f). The three primary tasks within the knowledge exchange project (attitudinal survey; research and reviews of internal policy processes; development of indicators) will provide a focal point of engagement for all interested parties and encourage their collaboration. More specifically, the Ulster team will host a number of seminars with stakeholders as identified above (a-f) to discuss the research design and allow for suggestions relating to the proposed survey, to present the results and initial analysis of the various research tasks, and collect comments on findings from the stakeholders which can be used to help develop the evidence based policy briefs. Policy briefing reports will then be used to disseminate further the academic thinking and evidence related to the challenges of formulating and implementing appropriate peace wall related policies. As a result, we expect a key benefit for those with whom we have engaged to be a greater awareness of the challenging issues and the development of stronger stakeholder relationships built up through their participation in our seminars, workshops and roundtable events. In the medium and longer term, the impact of the project will be seen in terms of the quality and depth of discussion surrounding the policy debate and subsequent implementation of policies aimed at removing peace walls. 

What are the potential impacts likely to be, and what is their importance?

The main potential impact of this knowledge exchange project is that it will facilitate local communities in working together to produce a phased plan of how to reduce and eventually remove peace walls and barriers in their areas. Our overall research programme and knowledge exchange activity will take 10 years and we are committed to following the policy area throughout that timeframe. There are key milestones and important moments within the next 10 year, which will have an impact on peace walls and public policy:
2014 - the rollout of the initial devolved government strategy
2015 - all external funding for peace walls best practice projects finish
2016 - Northern Ireland assembly election (and impact on policy direction)
2019 - 50th anniversary of the building of the first peace wall in Belfast
2023 - deadline for implementation strategy to remove peace walls.

Given that the maximum amount of time that we can bid for through this scheme is 12 months, we view this project as focusing exclusively on engagement around the rolling out of the initial government strategy while building the foundations for a sustained programme of activity over the longer term.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>114592</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In May 2013, the Northern Ireland Executive published a new community relations strategy document, 'Together: Building a United Community', which set itself the ambitious target of removing ALL interface barriers (peace walls) by 2023. Peace walls and interface barriers designed to secure communities through physical separation have been a feature of the physical, political and psychological landscape of Northern Ireland since 1969. They have long been seen as symbols of division and polarisation with enormous social and economic impact at local, city and regional level. This video presentation draws on the findings from a recently completed (September, 2015) ESRC funded research award, which involved a partnership between Ulster University and the Department of Justice that looked at the policy challenges around meeting such a target. The independently funded research, titled 'Public Policy and Peace Walls' enabled the researchers to act as a 'critical friend', as formative evaluators of a current policy implementation process, and as a provider of evidence-based research. Drawing on this work, this presentation will consider the numerous policy approaches to framing the issue of peace walls, and present new and innovative methods of interpreting the political and community narratives around what the walls represent in a post-conflict society.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9191AE5A-44E5-4156-A59E-3011D05C03A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not known at this time - update on downloads to follow....</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Dismantling the Peace Walls by 2023: &quot;rational&quot; or &quot;irrational&quot; policy thinking?</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/research-and-information-service-raise/knowledge-exchange/knowledge-exchange-seminars-series-5/jonny-byrne-cathy-gormley-heenan-duncan-morrow/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interface Community Partners and Interagency Group Annual Conference (December 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D549DFC9-41C1-4B8B-83B5-DAC7BDEA1DDD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At the conference, the project team presented key findings from the prepared policy papers in relation to:

Following the launch of our Attitudes to Peace Walls (2015) Survey, the minister publicly commented: 'Tensions around flags, emblems and parading have undoubtedly contributed to current attitudes around the removal of peace walls. However, I welcome the fact that engagement and dialogue around the future of these structures has been building. Increasing the level of interaction is vital to improving community relations and building confidence in a future without walls. There needs to be a greater emphasis on bringing people living at interfaces together. They have more in common than differences.'

In the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Minister has used our research finding to answer tabled questions by Members of the Legislative Assembly, most recently in January 2016 in response to the question: 'To ask the Minister of Justice to detail what is meant by the term removal in the Together: Building a United Community Strategy policy objective set for the removal of all peace walls by 2023'. This was a key question highlighted in our first policy brief as one needing to be addressed. The answer, with reference to our work, is here: http://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/questions/printquestionsummary.aspx?docid=254668


3. Our Policy Briefs prepared for the Department of Justice have been used by their newly established DOJ Interfaces Programme Board (which includes representation from other civil services departments beyond the Department of Justice as well as a range of statutory agencies). Their first meeting (February 2016) noted: 'Recent feedback from a number of sources, including work carried out by the Ulster University (UU) through Economic and Social Research Council funding, has identified issues in implementing the interface programme. In moving forward, Members of the Interface Programme Board will wish to consider respective strategies/programmes/actions etc that is/should be delivered to address these challenges'. 

4. Our review of the work of the International Fund for Ireland Peace Walls Programme (PWP) and engagement with funded groups over the ESRC funding period used to help shape and inform the development of the second tranche of funding under this Programme.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F369BB0B-2CAB-49C3-8733-79B1E8556AEB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through a series of knowledge exchange activities during the year, a safe space for academic, policy makers and practitioners was established to discuss the difficulties of policy implementation in a divided society and to identify, monitor and evaluate practical solutions. A number of achievements resulted from this:

Firstly, a number of new research questions have been opened up as a result of the partnership, particularly as they relate to the delivery and implementation of the government policy. We have explored these questions in detail with the department and key stakeholder and have raised them in our Knowledge Exchange Seminar in October 2015, at Parliament Building, Stormont in order to begin to stimulate conversation on possible ways to approach these research questions so that they have value for policy-makers and practitioners. These include questions on the challenges of definition and design of the policy; the challenges of delivery; and the challenges of engaging communities. Going forward we will want to know: What are the responsibilities of residents, community leaders and interface projects in delivering the TBUC target and how are they to be engaged? What do we mean by community confidence? How is community consent understood by the community and by policy-makers? We have also achieved recognition that there is a need for greater linguistic precision in relation to this policy priority using the TBUC phrase 'the removal of all peace walls' as an example of this - What does 'removal' mean? Is an environmental redesign of a wall the same as removal? What does 'all' mean - how many are all? Who will determine the list/numbers? What does 'peace wall' mean - does it include contested space and vacant/derelict land or does it not? 

Secondly, we have established a significant new research collaboration with a team of interdisciplinary scholars from across Ulster as a result of an identified a gap in the current evidence base used by the Northern Ireland Executive and government departments which we had uncovered during the course of our knowledge exchange activities with them. As a result, we were able to use our ESRC Award to help build a bigger research team of qualitative and quantitative research specialists to take forward a further project beginning in December 2015 through the ESRC Administrative Data Research Centre - Northern Ireland (ADRC-NI). What is absent at present, is a series of baseline indicators which can help policy makers from the various government departments understand the context and situation for those living closest to the peace walls. The ADRC-NI project will help us develop this series of baseline indicators which can then be used to assist in mapping progress on the implementation of the peace walls strategy 2013-2023. We will do this by producing reports (and subsequent academic papers and presentations) that will highlight the socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the areas designated as proximate to the peace walls. This will inevitably entail comparison with less deprived areas, thus adding to the more general debate on social inequalities. 

Thirdly, we have successfully facilitated a series of closed roundtable workshops and engagements with key stakeholders (in excess of 60 such activities) resulting in the development and production of a number of confidential strategic and operational planning documents for them. Given the sensitivities around much of this work, these remain confidential. As a result, the research team has achieved a much greater degree of embedddness within this policy arena and are confident that the research and knowledge exchange relationship will continue beyond the lifecycle of the funding. 

Finally, we have has successfully produced a new public attitudinal survey which considers the views of those people living in closest proximity to the peace walls. This will be used by the Department of Justice and other stakeholders as they shape their policy implementation strategies going forward. The new survey was publicly launched at the end of December 2015. It is likely that the results of this survey, coupled with the new research questions identified above, will mean that the research team will be engaged in further extensive dissemination and engagement activities in 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings from the attitudinal survey, from our research and reviews of internal policy processes, and from the development of indicators through the use of ADRC-NI data gathering will provide a focal point of engagement for all interested parties and encourage their collaboration. Already, we have been asked to present the findings at the forthcoming Annual Joint Inter Agency Group (IAG) and Inter Community Partnership (ICP) Conference in December 2016, a significant policy network dedicated to the broad issue of interfaces. We have been asked to present the findings to the Northern Ireland Executive's Together: Building a United Community (TBUC) Programme Board, the government appointed Board responsible for the implementation of the TBUC strategy in February 2016. Our published policy briefs have been disseminated extensively across the full spectrum of stakeholders and produced in video format to allow for use by others. The Department of Justice have indicated that they already using these policy briefs in their own deliberations on enhancing implementation strategies. In the medium and longer term, the impact of the project's findings will be seen in terms of the quality and depth of discussion surrounding the policy debate and subsequent implementation of policies aimed at removing peace walls.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B3F06B05-5B83-4298-B01F-73F503D26ACF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and
