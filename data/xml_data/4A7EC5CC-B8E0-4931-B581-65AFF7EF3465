Our ability to interpret and use these signals is a critical feature of our everyday lives. Recently, we have made several strides in developing our understanding of the psychological and neural mechanisms that contribute to our social perception abilities, and how they change across our lifespan.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This seminar series aims to provide a window into the mechanisms that contribute to our social perception abilities, how they change as we age, and what the consequences of these changes are. A series of four public workshops and a website will be run. Each workshop will include talks by experts on the topics of:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>social perception in infancy&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>social perception in childhood&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>social perception in adolescence&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>aging and social perception.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The website will be used to provide updates on:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the workshops&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>podcasts from the sessions&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>blog posts,summarising core points from each day. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>By bringing together researchers in the field of social perception research and other interested parties we hope to raise public understanding of social perception research and to develop novel lines of investigation about mechanisms of social perception across the lifespan.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is expected that the seminar series will benefit a number of groups within the UK and internationally. These will include academics, professionals and the public. 

The workshops and online conference will impact academics with direct and indirect interests in how our social perception abilities change as we age. For psychologists and neuroscientists researching mechanisms of social perception (direct interests), the seminar series will facilitate dialogue between early and senior researchers on key issues related to mechanisms of social perception across the lifespan. For other academic groups with less direct interests (e.g. sociologists and clinicians), the seminar series will provide the chance for engagement with novel findings in the field of social neuroscience/psychology, the opportunity for collaboration and discussion with groups outside of their direct field of study, and the potential for wider dissemination of their own work (e.g. of the consequences of changes in social perception abilities on society). This will be facilitated by talks given by senior researchers and the use of discussant groups made up of early career researchers; by the opportunity for questions from all workshop participants; and through the web conference discussion forums that will be open to all. The seminar series will therefore promote knowledge transfer, lead to the formation of potential collaborations, and the generation of new lines of study within this field. 

The workshops and online conference will also be open to the public and professionals working in related fields (e.g. teachers, carers, policy makers - groups where understanding mechanisms of social perception contributes to their work). This will promote knowledge exchange and public understanding of science. It will be facilitated by the talks and discussion sessions held at each workshop; through networking opportunities at the workshops; and through the web conference discussions (including video clips related to key issues raised by the workshops). Moreover, it is hoped that the web conference will provide and important online resource that will have a large impact on knowledge transfer about how social perception abilities changes as we age, and the impact of these changes on social interaction.

The international nature of the seminar series will also mean that the impact for all of these groups will not only be restricted to the UK - understanding how social perception abilities change across the lifespan (and the impact of this) is an important global issue and therefore the impact of discussions raised by the seminar series will be wide reaching. All of this will be facilitated by including international speakers at the workshops and the web conference discussions/conference video gallery that will be open to all.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14879</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social Perception Across the Lifespan Childhood Workshop (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>387C5741-D98E-49F3-9140-6393C4885F22</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop formed the second of four that were held as part of an ESRC Seminar Series Grant.

The four workshops that were hosted as part of the grant attracted approximately 60 attendees per workshop, made up of a mixture of individuals from different areas of academia, practitioners (e.g. teachers), and the general public. By appealing to this mixed audience the workshops directly impacted on understanding and awareness of research related to lifespan changes in social perception abilities across a range of groups, which was anecdotally reported to influence / change thinking afterwards (e.g. by teachers that attended some of the workshops). The events also led to novel collaborations, which resulted in successful funding applications. In parallel, the talks from the workshops were made available online through podcasting of the workshops and blogging (via www.socialperception.co.uk).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EE32E1CF-434D-4C4B-83A4-37BBB32C3781</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This ESRC Seminar Series grant supported four public workshops related to 'Social Perception Across the Lifespan'. Each workshop was themed around a particular age group (e.g. 'Social Perception in Infancy') and attracted attendees from different disciplines in academia (e.g. psychology, neuroscience, education), practitioners (e.g. teachers), and the general public. There were also international attendees at each workshop, and speakers from Europe and USA took part. A core feature of each workshop was the involvement of Early Career Researchers and the opportunity for discussion between Early Career Researchers and more senior academic colleagues was promoted. This was achieved through a mix of speakers at each workshop from Early Career academics through to Professors, and through discussion sessions led by Early Career Researchers following each talk. This therefore facilitated increased research capability through the opportunity for Early Career Researchers to actively engage in presenting their work to different sectors (e.g. academics from different disciplines and public sector) and the development of new research networks / collaboration opportunities involving UK and overseas partners. For example, building on one of the workshops themed around 'Social Perception in Aging' the PI is now involved in forming collaborations with researchers interested in aging and social perception at different UK and European institutions, and is exploring avenues for collaborative funding; active research collaborations were formed between researchers at Goldsmiths, City University, and Kings College London; and discussions have taken place about plans to develop a proposal for a journal special issue based on the workshop content.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main impact activity of this Seminar Series Grant was to facilitate knowledge transfer / public awareness of the impacts that changes in social perception abilities across the lifespan can have, and to facilitate the interaction between early and late career researchers. This was achieved through the involvement of practitioners and academics from different fields of study at the workshops. Further, Early Career Researchers played an active role in presenting and discussing work with this broad group of attendees. In this regard, increased collaboration between academic groups (including early and senior career researchers) and increased dialogue between academia and the public was facilitated, which may be taken forward through the development of new networks and raised public awareness of how social perception skills change throughout the lifespan.

More broadly, the workshops were podcast to increase impact on knowledge exchange between different groups and a workshop website (www.socialperception.co.uk) was developed. This is an on-going activity that is likely to provide a further means to engage with a range of audiences about the contents of the seminars and be an important source of impact for public understanding of science in the longer term.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>70A5D48E-A451-48B0-96BC-87795765FEF3</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J02192X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
