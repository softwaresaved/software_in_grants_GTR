How then do we decide which historical places are most precious and most worthy of public esteem? How is that distinction experienced, identified and ultimately awarded? Valuing elements of the built environment through acts of designation (whether castle, phone box, road sign, parkland, or wilderness) is necessary for any society with a sense of its past and a collective desire to maintain it. But what is the difference between a Grade 1 and a Grade 2 listed building, or a state and national historic landmark, in both a technical sense, and in terms of our qualitative encounters with those places? This research will work with the National Register of Historic Places in the US, English Heritage and CADW in the UK, and an array of non-state groups and initiatives involved in alternative historic designations to investigate how value is assessed through technical procedures and how value is experienced as a quality that is actually apprehended in place.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is designed to ensure that the research engages non-academic beneficiaries and delivers intended impacts through its collaborative nature at the outset with the cross-sector trans-Atlantic Advisory Group; through timetabled meetings with that Advisory Group driven around commentary and input into monthly PI-compiled working papers; through the iterative nature of the project's interview component; through a dissemination strategy geared around practitioner publications; and through the specified design of a &amp;quot;Locating Value&amp;quot; practitioner protocol which will be developed and refined through consultation. 

This research will benefit a wide range of audiences in the US and UK directly and indirectly including public sector institutions with remits in cultural and historical resource management and planning, as well as third sector operations (for example conservation groups, community arts organizations, urban planners and private historic preservation consultancies). 

The broader public sphere will benefit from the research, in particular, individuals with a specific interest or declared stake in the historical built environment, and also, more widely, anyone who visits or comes into regular contact with places and landscapes badged as &amp;quot;historic&amp;quot;. 

Specific impacts include the cultivation of a more refined connection between the way value is formally assigned and the way it is experienced in the historical built environment; an associated increase in the effectiveness of investment in the historic built environment and its regulation; an improved &amp;quot;public buy in&amp;quot; to the management of the historical built environment; greater opportunities for engagement and collaboration with local community groups about the merit and significance of historic buildings and more ephemeral places; an enhanced capacity for historical built resources within local neighbourhoods and communities to foster social cohesion, active citizenship, and cultural vibrancy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26038</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>For reflection on existing practices of listing and historic preservation in built environment by practitioners in UK and US and other agencies and advocates</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>86B812CF-1B61-42F0-814B-610B87963491</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I encountered a group of dedicated practitioners in the awkward position of both believing and not believing in the fair and 'neutral' valuational frameworks they work to apply on a day to day basis. On the one hand preservation officers could use their system to defend themselves against charges of bias: &amp;quot;We don't have views, we're not trying to be arbiters - we feed nominations into the system and see how they measure up&amp;quot;. On the other hand many recognised that influence was often and is still brought to bare in the composition of lists either through external political pressure or internally held personal preferences and priorities. Less obvious though was the systematic bias coded in to logics of selection that privilege the kinds of histories that are already heavily represented.

The research project developed a relational theory of value to question this kind of 'inclusion via expansion'-based solution. A relation theory of value asserts that any judgment of value involves the reciprocal removal of value from something else. We are not simply saying therefore that one thing is good, we are unavoidably saying that one thing is better than another, one building should be ranked higher than another, one application for funding is more worthy than another, and so on. Value relies on creating an equivalence. It operates in a zero sum game. Value cannot be self-sufficient and infinitely amassed since every attribution leads also to a disavowal. By identifying only the very best and showcasing the exclusively positive outcomes of their listing practices preservation agencies in the US and UK ignore value's limits.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In his essay on the Destiny of Value Baudrillard makes this same point: &amp;quot;Because we no longer know what is true or false, what is good or evil, what has value or does not, we are forced to store everything, record everything, conserve everything, and from this an irrevocable devaluation ensues all that lives by value will perish by equivalence&amp;quot; (1998, 4). So if value as a concept is to promote social justice and advance equality then what we require more than anything else is its re-distribution. We can't simply add more things to a list, we need to take things off the list as well.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B0691850-CCD1-4230-BF34-EBBD907E57F6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.academia.edu/6457895/Locating_Value_making_significance_in_the_historical_built_environment_a_trans-Atlantic_review</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/40368DBF-049B-4172-BAA1-3C929B8629D9"><gtr:id>40368DBF-049B-4172-BAA1-3C929B8629D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Locating value: assigning significance in the historical built environment, a trans-Atlantic review</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/324752b86fab82b1532534349320c6d5"><gtr:id>324752b86fab82b1532534349320c6d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hoskins G C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8AFF27FA-3352-4C43-9ECD-2A6529CDF7AA"><gtr:id>8AFF27FA-3352-4C43-9ECD-2A6529CDF7AA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Vagaries of value at California State Parks: towards a geographical axiology</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>cultural geographies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b74ca4e56e8d585889c16d54c3861cbc"><gtr:id>b74ca4e56e8d585889c16d54c3861cbc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hoskins G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9E29EBE3-85E9-480C-B3D3-CFC9945C585F"><gtr:id>9E29EBE3-85E9-480C-B3D3-CFC9945C585F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Crafting preservation criteria: the National Register of Historic Places and American historic preservation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Heritage Tourism</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/324752b86fab82b1532534349320c6d5"><gtr:id>324752b86fab82b1532534349320c6d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hoskins G C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EB27BD1D-4122-42D2-ACF1-9235FE9372A4"><gtr:id>EB27BD1D-4122-42D2-ACF1-9235FE9372A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Vagaries of Value</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Context: The journal of the Institute of Historic Building Conservation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/324752b86fab82b1532534349320c6d5"><gtr:id>324752b86fab82b1532534349320c6d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hoskins G C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L00481X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CB391BE-87E7-4006-A2C5-43ED9DBA773C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural and Anthrop Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D6754CC-B7DE-45FB-BB9D-CE7AA05892D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Historical Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1D32A760-9B88-43D4-8BDA-F0236A67470A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
