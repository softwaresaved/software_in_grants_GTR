The origins of rap can be traced back from the first commercial recordings of hip-hop in the 1970s, through slavery, to precolonial Africa. The performed character of rap is of significance to understanding the origins of poetry and the role of oral-poetic forms in maintaining the structure of preliterate societies. Rap is now the most popular poetic form in the world. With artists such as Dizzee Rascal, Roll Deep, Wretch 32, Tinie Tempah, Chipmunk and the So Solid Crew reaching the top of the UK charts, rap music has also entered into the mainstream of British life. UK hip-hop and grime are also politically significant subcultures, through which working-class youths use rap to represent their conditions of urban dwelling. However, there is little scholarship on rap in the United Kingdom. The development of hip-hop over the last 35 years into a mainstream pop music genre and the production of grime as a distinctively British vernacular culture, highlight the importance of examining how the identities of British youths are shaped through rap.

As a generation of Britons have grown up with rap as an ordinary part of their everyday lives, the proposed research will examine urgent questions regarding the impact that rap culture has on the identities of English youths and how state funded organisations influence the articulation of alternative English identities through rap in the wider hip-hop and grime scenes. Through this focus on the performance of rap in these institutions the project will examine the rhetorical and performative techniques used by rap artists to solicit identity from their audience members; to analyse how audience members produce identification in response to rap performances; to investigate the circulation of rap culture within and between different state funded institutions; and the impact of this cultural form on the communities from which young rap artists emerge.

Studies of rap songs have predominantly employed textual analysis in a manner that obscures the significance of performance in this oral culture. Attempts to develop a hip-hop poetics and highlight rap's literary qualities are significant contributions to making rap amenable to incorporation within English studies. However, the textual analysis of rap lyrics fails to account for the mutually constitutive relations between the formal qualities of rap as a performed oral-poetic genre and the social forms produced within rap subcultures. By attending to the interaction between performers, audience members, and the performance context, the research will provide a fuller account of the social, cultural and aesthetic significance of rap. The project will investigate the impact that rap performances have on the identities of children and young adults and analyse how the rhetorical and performative techniques employed by rappers produce identities and identification between and within communities. Through a critical engagement with rap performances in one youth centre, a community centre, a young offenders institution and a prison, the team of researchers, with expertise in literary studies, cultural sociology, performance studies and prisons research, will investigate the impact that rap has on these organisations and analyse how rappers' performances, in institutions funded by national and local governments, produce alternative British identities. The research will address the following questions:

What are the relations between between the rapper, dj, audience members and performance context in rap performances?
How are alternative British identities produced through rap performances in state funded institutions?
How does rap contribute to the culture and ethos within youth clubs, community centres, young offenders institutions and prisons in England?
How are prison rap cultures interconnected with those in mainstream society?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will impact upon five distinct groups.

1) Youths and young adults in the youth and community centres will benefit from the opportunity to reflect on their cultural practice through a combination of interviews and workshops organised by the principal investigator and research assistant. The research is aimed at improving understanding of rap in England and how this cultural form shapes the identities of British youths. Through attending the first day of a two-day seminar in June 2016 these youths and young adults will benefit from the opportunity for informal exchange with scholars with interests in an area of cultural practice that is meaningful to these young people.

2) Staff and managers in the youth and community centres will benefit from the opportunity to reflect on their professional practice through a combination of interviews with the Principal Investigator and Research Assistant. The research is aimed at examining how this cultural form shapes the identities of British youths and the impact that it has on a variety of government funded institutions. Through attending the first day of the two-day seminar in June 2016, youth and community centre staff and managers will benefit from feedback on the youth and community centre fieldwork and the opportunity for exchange with scholars with interests in an area of cultural practice that is meaningful to the young people that they provide services to and are responsible for.

3) Prisoners in the young offenders institution and high security prison will have the opportunity to discuss important aspects of their social and cultural lives through interviews, seminars and workshops, in contexts in which such opportunities are rare. The Principal Investigator will organise and lead a series of rap workshops in the young offenders institution and high security prison, providing offenders with the opportunity for reflection on their cultural practices and for personal growth, in institutional contexts that substantially limit educational opportunities.

4) The National Offenders Management Service will benefit from the study of the impact of rap culture on two contrasting prison establishments. The research will deepen our understanding of prison social climates, in ways that have direct impact on the management of prisons. In feeding back results to the high security prison and young offenders institution, we will produce detailed reports of findings for each establishment. In order to maximise the impact on practice, the Principal Investigator and Co-Investigator will offer feedback presentations to senior managers and staff in each establishment. A one day seminar in December 2016, to be attended by academics and senior prison service managers, will explore the implications of the project for the National Offender Management Service.

5) The general public will benefit from the better understanding of the role that rap plays in shaping young people's identities. By selecting rap artists who have achieved recognition at local, national or international levels, to attend the seminar at Cambridge in June 2016, the project will aim to produce impacts in the local communities and amongst the wider audiences of these young people. The Principal Investigator will participate in a live radio interview on the community and internet radio station, Rinse FM. The interview will describe the research process and the main findings. By disseminating our research through this former pirate radio station, the PI will build upon his established relations with cultural practitioners in London's grime 'scene' and target the project's public engagement at an interested and informed audience. The Principal Investigator will also write an article for The Guardian newspaper on the impact of rap culture on state funded institutions, in order to address a wider non-specialist audience. This newspaper has featured number of articles on the development of grime music in England.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>148448</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Performing Hip Hop Englishness Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>74ED6FAE-E14C-4C3E-BABE-5FBC9BA8138D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Performing Hip Hop Englishness Festival took place on the third and final day of 'It Ain't Where You're From, It's Where You're At': International Hip Hop Studies Conference. Four young people, three youth workers, and a youth services manager from Docklands Youth Centre in St. Paul's, Bristol, where the research team had been conducting ethnographic fieldwork attended the event. The Festival was also attended by the Head of English at School 21, a teacher at Rushey Mead School in Leicester, and a teacher at Kingsbury school in London. Members of the research team presented their research, which included testimony from some of the young people attending the event. The young people participated in two workshops: 1) an hour-and-a-half workshop on entering the music industry run by JJ, a leading grime DJ, and 2) a two-hour workshop on stage performance techniques run by TY, a leading UK rapper. During the afternoon, the four youth workers (who specialise in developing young people's music production and performance skills) attended a panel on using hip hop in education. The six-person panel mixed researchers, school teachers, rappers and educators. After attending the event, the youth workers spoke very positively about the value of the experience. As a result of attending the conference one of the youth workers began to recognise that their own practice was a form of hip hop studies: &amp;quot;We basically do hip-hop studies, because trying to instilling ethics into young people, that is hip-hop.&amp;quot; Further to this she felt that the conference helped her to see how the work being undertaken within academia could be relevant to her professional practice: &amp;quot;we can draw on it [hip-hop studies] more, but without even knowing it we have that within our organisation&amp;quot;. Attendees, including the rappers and djs performing at the event, posted images of the event on twitter using the hastag #grimeycambridge. The conference was reported in the print and broadcast media, including an hour long debate on whether hip-hop is worthy of academic study on LBC Radio.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/hashtag/grimeycambridge?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;src=hash</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ESRC Impact Acceleration Account (IAA) Programme 2015-16</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F419FEAB-F9BF-4E7E-825C-78FA7E7AD774</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The 'It Ain't Where You're From, It's Where You're At': International Hip Hop Studies Conference was a three-day event, which brought together over one hundred scholars from a range of disciplinary backgrounds to share their research in the field of hip-hop studies. Following the announcement of the call for papers the research team gave interviews with, and the upcoming conference was reported in, the Cambridge News and Times Higher Education. Subsequently, Dazed magazine and the Independent ran stories featuring or referring to the event. The conference also made an impact through radio. It was mentioned in the introduction to Any Questions on Radio 4 on Friday the 19th and Saturday the 20th February 2016. The significance of event was discussed extensively and gave rise to a one hour debate on the value of rap music on James O'Brien's LBC programme on the 26th February. We invited a journalist from the Economist to the event, and she attended the first two days of the conference.

The Performing Hip Hop Englishness Festival took place on the third and final day of the conference. The Festival on day three was aimed at breaking down the barriers between the University and the 'outside world'. Amongst the non-academic beneficiaries were four young people (three rappers and one singer), three youth workers and a youth services manager from Docklands Youth Centre in St. Paul's, Bristol, where the PI and RA had been conducting ethnographic fieldwork for over six months. The event was also attended by the Head of English at School 21, a teacher at Rushey Mead School in Leicester, and a teacher at Kingsbury school in London. The young people participated in two workshops 1) an hour-and-a-half workshop on entering the music industry run by JJ, a leading grime DJ and 2) a two-hour workshop on stage performance techniques run by TY, a leading UK rapper. Both the young people and youth workers also attended a panel in which the Research Assistant presented findings from the research on rap at their youth centre in Bristol, which included their own testimonies.

During the afternoon, the four youth workers (who specialise in developing young people's music production and performance skills) attended a panel on using hip hop in education. The six-person panel mixed researchers, school teachers, rappers and educators. After attending the conference, the youth workers spoke very positively about the value of the experience. As a result of attending the conference one of the youth workers began to recognise that their own practice was a form of hip hop studies: &amp;quot;We basically do hip-hop studies, because trying to instil ethics into young people, that is hip-hop.&amp;quot; Further to this she felt that the conference helped her to see how the work being undertaken within academia could be relevant to her professional practice: &amp;quot;we can draw on it [hip-hop studies] more, but without even knowing it we have that within our organisation&amp;quot;.

It was clear that the youth workers thought the event had a powerful impact on them would have a lasting influence on the young people and their work with them. One said: &amp;quot;It was an eye opener for me, because I felt that the culture of hip-hop education is a lot bigger than I thought it was. That was really good for me and inspirational For ACE as well, its something that we can include ourselves in in the future to benefit what we're doing, and use to it as a resource really, to create better services for us. There was a lot of strong material, strong models, and strong ethos around using hip-hop to educate. I hope that this continues in the future and [we can use it to help us to] do what we do in a more effective way. There is a big body of work that could come from this and that's something that we'd want to be involved with.&amp;quot; The youth workers and the youth services manager exchanged contacts with a number of people during the Festival that they intend to follow up on, with one saying: &amp;quot;It felt like we started something that day, by just having a debate. We almost started like a movement it felt like, that is possibly going to carry on because it seemed like everyone was going to keep trying to keep it going on. It felt like something started from there.&amp;quot;

From the feedback from the youth workers it was also clear that the particular way the Festival had been designed had facilitated important forms of engagements for the young people, as well as more generally. One said: &amp;quot;Having artists from the grime and UK hip-hop scenes made the event more relevant to the young people. Their [the young people's] session [with JJ] was very, very good. One of them has a picture on their Facebook. To be able to capture these kids for that long. They've learned a lot from him.&amp;quot; 

The event helped to break down barriers between the University and youth services. As one of the youth workers explained: &amp;quot;The link between us [higher education and youth work] isn't as vast as we thought. The fact that Cambridge are looking at hip-hop as a way of educating and bringing people together, that alone puts us on the same page in a lot of ways and there's no reason that that can't continue and grow even bigger. A lot of barriers are broken in that respect.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>75FF1ED4-02F9-4C44-8AD5-132C42F0883F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Youth centres make significant contributions to local rap cultures. Forest Gate Youth Zone in Newham, was once at the heart of London's emergent grime scene and served as a site in which young people could hone their creative skills. A number of rappers who went on to become nationally recognised within the grime scene practiced and performed at Forest Gate Youth Zone. The scaling down of the services provided by the youth centre, as a result of austerity related budget cuts, highlights the extent to which local and national government supported local rap culture. Historically this youth centre provided equipment, staff with expertise in using music technologies, and facilitated live rapping performances. Following substantial reductions in the youth service budget, there is now no significant rap culture in Forest Gate Youth Zone. 

Docklands youth centre in St. Paul's, Bristol, currently makes an important contribution to the city's rap scene. The youth centre facilitates the rap culture within it in a variety of ways, including through the provision of space, technological resources, staff expertise, and the freedom to play. Docklands provides a nurturing environment in which young people can develop their rap skills through largely self-organised freestyling in the live room as well as gain experience in music production. The youth centre brings young people together, fostering social networks, and musical groupings. It also provides access to the broader music scene through the recording of young people's work and facilitating contact with cultural entrepreneurs. Several young rappers at the youth centre have had music videos recorded and posted on the YouTube channel SimzCityTV. The channel features over 400 videos featuring the work of Bristol's musicians and has over 6,000 subscribers. The owner of the channel regularly attends the Wednesday sessions at the youth centre.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is very little research on the impact of rap culture on different types of organisations or how institutional settings influence rap. This culture seems to be used very narrowly by social organisations to engage youth potentially at risk of engaging criminality. Children and Young People's Services might draw on this research to broaden the role that rap plays in their organisation. There is significant potential to broaden the focus on rap and ethics to engage with issues of aesthetics, entrepreneurship, and politics through rap.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E64E7BF2-0552-4090-90D4-22E248AE08E4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M011275/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>C9325A90-815F-4E6E-999D-E068325FF591</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/M011275/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>198732.43</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-02-07</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>7AD4C885-1474-4CD7-8B98-7A2682887E66</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/M011275/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>148448.59</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-02-08</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>C7C1FADE-C7C1-4B05-871D-DF0A9ACF299A</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/M011275/3</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>50641.52</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnography &amp; Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>24458E6F-3AC3-41F2-966D-9647A4AEE99D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
