Our population will continue to age with an increasing absolute and relative number of people aged 50 and over. At the same time there will also be a marked increase the proportion of people in black and minority populations in the later life age groups as we see the ageing of the migrant populations who moved to the UK in the post war period.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However we know very little about the circumstances and experiences of black and minority elders in terms how they experience 'growing older'; what the key challenges (and opportunities) this confronts them with, what are the most important research questions to ask, what are the best ways to undertake research with these diverse groups; how should we train health and social care staff to work with diverse populations and how relevant is contemporary social and health policy for these diverse groups.&amp;nbsp; Our series of six seminars will identify and debate the key issues surrounding the experience of ageing amongst a diverse range of ethnic minority communities.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ultimate aim of this seminar series is to stimulate research in the broad area of ageing amongst ethnic minority communities via the creation of a robust new research network, the generation of research outputs and the development of a research agenda. This is a long term goal, and it is expected that it will have, in the long term, social impact. This will result from contributing towards: evidence based policy-making; shaping and enhancing the effectiveness of public services; helping to transform evidenced based policy into practice and influencing professionals and practitioners working in related fields. In addition, it will help to inform public awareness and understanding of issues around 'growing older' for ethnic minority communities. 

In the shorter term, there will be a range of opportunities for the research team to contribute to current debates, policy and practice. Building strong research relationships with potential users, fellow researchers and other relevant parties in the early stages of the series will provide the foundation for creating significant impact in the longer term. Indeed, an important short to medium term impact will arise from the creation of strong working relationships with the range of stakeholders involved in seminars in order to facilitate collaboration on new projects, the co-production of new research, conference presentations and other activities aimed at raising the profile of this important topic

Who will benefit and how?

a) Policy makers and practitioners
New evidence will be generated upon which to develop appropriate policies, practices and understanding about people growing older within black and ethnic minority communities;

b) Third sector and voluntary organisations
Increasingly, the social and physical environment for older people has become central in promoting well-being in later life. Charities that advocate for older people play an important role in facilitating developments in these areas. This project will recognise the specific needs of older people from black and ethnic minority populations and help such charities to better understand these populations' needs;

c) Older people from ethnic minority communities
The voices of older people remain muted within much research and this is especially so for those from minority communities, particularly the 'hidden' and more recently arrived groups. Our seminar series will give a voice to this important group of older people and ensure that their concerns and issues are made visible to the research, policy and practice communities;

d) Early career researchers participating in the seminars
They will have the opportunity to both develop substantive and methodological skills but will benefit from a range of career development activities including advice on publishing, mentoring and the opportunity to broaden their networks amongst a range of relevant communities (academic, policy, practice &amp;amp; older people);

e) The seminar series organising team
We anticipate that a successful seminar series will have a long term positive impact on the careers of those involved. This project provides a unique opportunity for the three early career researcher applicants to participate in interdisciplinary meetings and the extra skills gained from participating in an interdisciplinary project will enhance their employability along with the other substantive and transferable skills gained as being part of the organising team.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18095</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ethics and methods of researching older adults from minority(ised) ethnic groups</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C77E104F-FB4B-489A-8279-1014618E3222</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion of complexity of undertaking research with minority elders</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have informed the development of policy in Runnymede about the needs of the ageing population in our minority communities. It has raised their awareness of the existence of this group.

A key aim of our seminar series was to bring together international researchers and we have established good research links with researchers in the USA (Prof Ajrouch), Canada (Prof Keating) and with the IMISCOE group on ageing migrants. We submitted an EU grant on older migrants which was unsuccessful (2015-December). 
Within the UK we have developed a network of gerontologists interested in the ageing of minority groups as part of a developing interested in 'new ageing' populations. However we have had disappointing levels of engagement with scholars of race and ethnicity.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5F14A81D-2B55-4FE9-85A9-F351DFCDB5C2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As this was a seminar series we have not undertaken primary research to create new knowledge.

Papers from our seminar series were published in a special issue of Ageing and Society in 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We think the importance of conducting high quality life course research is important and the need to be more sophisticated in approaching research conducted in a range of languages. We also think it important to examine differences within and between migrant groups from a range of countries of origin. it is important to consider the identification of the appropriate reference
