Recent years have seen a growing interest in the potential for use of sonic crystals as noise barriers. Sonic crystals take their name from the analogous effects of photonic crystals on light. They consist of periodic arrays of circular cylinders and are known to give high attenuation at selective frequencies as a consequence of multiple scattering. The frequencies of highest attenuation can be found by assuming that an integer number of half wavelengths fits the distance between the scatterers. One of the main advantages of sonic crystals (SCs) is that by varying the distance between the cylinders it is possible to attain peaks of attenuation in a certain range of frequencies. One advantage of an SC barrier would be its relative optical transparency. Another would be its relative permeability to wind, thus reducing the effects of barrier induced turbulence and wind-gradient enhancement. In principle, if SC barriers are used as highway noise barriers on both sides of a road, there should be less reverberation than between solid barriers. The appearance of an SC barrier might also have a rather positive aesthetic impact. After all, the interest in using SCs as barriers started with the discovery that a 'sculpture' consisting of vertical parallel cylinders acted as a sound barrier. Various possible designs of SC barriers will be considered. In addition to 'conventional' vertical circular cylinder arrays, the acoustical performance of horizontal cylinders arrays above a reflecting plane, ellipsoidal cylinder arrays and curved arrays will be investigated both analytically/numerically and through laboratory measurements. The optimisation of the design of SC arrays making use of acoustic lens effects and coverings will be investigated. The acoustical performance of vertical cylinder arrays in configurations suitable for road traffic noise will be tested and compared with that of a simple barrier in various wind conditions by the Transport Research Laboratory.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>346646</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Organ of Corti is an experimental instrument that recycles noise or 'broadband' sounds in our environment, it does not make any
sound of its own, but rather it attempts to draw our attention to the sounds already present by framing them in a new way.
Named after the organ of hearing in your inner ear, it uses the acoustic technology of sonic crystals to accentuate and attenuate
frequencies within the broad range of sound frequencies present in road traffic or falling water.
By recycling surplus sounds from our environment, we hope to challenge expectations of what might constitute a piece of music
by adding nothing to the existing soundscape but rather offering new ways of listening to what is already there.
We very much hope that this instrument might be a device that rematerializes our experience of sound and becomes itself an
invitation to &amp;quot;listen to ourselves listen&amp;quot;.
The instrument itself consists of four-meter high cylinders which constitute a sonic crystal. This crystal alters the predominant
frequencies from the location it is situated - a road, weir, river for example - and plays them back attenuated and enhanced without
the addition of new sounds. The sonic crystals filter the sounds that envelop its surroundings, allowing musical structures to be perceived. Thus, the instrument may be perceived as sculpting day-to-day noises into a composition that questions one's notion of musicality and indeed the genesis of music itself.
One questions whether the soundscape of the everyday could be, or already is, music.
Such acoustic surprises, created from the known world, resituate and ground the listener within the aural environment.
Through once dulled senses, the ears listen consciously, actively once more - cutting through the noise and hyper-stimulation
of contemporary life. One listens via the Organ of Corti and is transported to a world sculpted and formed in and from sound.
One melts into the saturated soundscape, thinking and moving as sound, questioning what is it to listen. What it is to listen to
one's self listening.
Mindful of the origin of the Organ of Corti's 'world composition': a mediated soundscape filtered from the environment and made
celestial through cutting-edge technology, it could be said that the conceptual and structural qualities of the crystal frames the sonic landscape (whilst the physicality of the Organ of Corti acts as a focal point for causality and context for the listener). This framework allows one to listen - perhaps more acutely, certainly differently, and to notice that difference. Thinking analogously here, the Organ of Corti heightens awareness of the aural sense, allowing one to listen to sound comparable to the way that the eyes 'look' and 'watch'. One is thus able to challenge assumptions of the hierarchy of looking and listening. Within the Organ, the ears rule.</gtr:description><gtr:id>56BD801A-741B-4800-AD7D-BD5EE60D995F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Winner of the Performing Rights Society Fund New Music award in 2010.

A joint application to the PRSF new music fund resulted in an award and the creation of a travelling exhibit the 'Organ of Corti'. Among the four locations around the UK the most successful was near a weir on the river Severn near Worcester. The exhibit was featured in an article in 'Timeout' on 30th June 2011.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3120D925-D0B4-4C4F-8827-03CBF52EE4AD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Traditional noise barriers may be unsightly and divide communities. In principle barriers consisting of vertical arrays of cylinders can be made visually more attractive and can include pathways through them. The main problem is that while reducing some parts of a noise they can exaggerate other parts. Also their performance depends on the angle at which sound arrives. These problems can be addressed by making the cylinders resonant. The project explored two ways of achieving the required resonance and demonstrated their effectiveness in the laboratory. One of the methods was also demonstrated in a full scale field trial at a specially constructed test site on the Open University Milton Keynes campus.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results have been published in academic journals.
