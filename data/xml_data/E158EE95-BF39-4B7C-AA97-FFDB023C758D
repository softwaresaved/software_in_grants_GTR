Developing such an algorithm is a particular concern for practitioners who use auralisation as a consultation tool in acoustic design of built spaces. In this process the data from the simulation model is rendered as sound by a loudspeaker system allowing a client or stakeholder, who is unlikely to be an expert in acoustics, to form a judgement on whether the acoustic design fits their needs. This process is of course only valid if the acoustic model delivers accurate prediction of how sound behaves in the space, and current commercial software does not always succeed in this task because the high-frequency geometric propagation assumption on which it is based breaks down at low frequencies and in spaces where diffraction effects are significant. Although alternate numerical methods exist they are typically limited to modelling only low frequencies since their computational cost becomes impractical as frequency or time-resolution is increased. In response to these shortcomings, this project will develop a new hybrid method which combines the best features of geometric methods and fully numerical boundary element method (BEM) solvers to provide a scheme that inherits desirable characteristics from both approaches; i.e. fully error controllable schemes, more accurate than geometric methods for low to mid range frequencies, but with reduced computational cost at higher frequencies compared to standard BEM, all achieved within a single unified framework. Such a model would potentially include all wave terms, geometric and diffracted, but lower energy reflections would only be included where necessary to achieve a given accuracy criterion (e.g. an SPL threshold or a function of the ear's perceptible difference limen) hence computational efficiency would be maximised.

Introducing an element of interactivity to the auralisation process, where a user would be able to explore the space and/or make dynamic changes to the sources and building geometry or materials, would be desirable from a consultation-productivity perspective but place extremely high demands on the acoustic model. Not only must the model dynamically update to reflect the modifications made by the user, but the requirement for accuracy is even more pressing since any feature the client chooses to introduce must be accurately rendered, even if it has a strong acoustic effect (e.g. concave focussing surfaces, room resonances, unusual echo patterns), and there will be little or no opportunity for an expert to check that the sound is realistic. The new algorithm we propose will address these needs since, as well as having improved accuracy, it also has the desirable characteristic that only a small easily identified subset of the acoustic interaction data needs to be re-computed when a change in building geometry or source location occurs; incorporating support for modelling time variant and interactive scenarios would hence be relatively straightforward. Towards this goal the project will also develop a new auralisation orientated audio platform which will represent acoustic interactions by a network of digital filters and output sound direct to audio hardware, and the simulation algorithm will be geared towards outputting reduced acoustic models in this format. Pilot studies will investigate how interactivity might be supported, as dynamic modifications of scenario objects and corresponding filter network elements, and how standard lumped parameter sound insulation and stochastic reverberation models may be incorporated. The project will conclude with a work package dedicated to modelling some real-world scenarios which would cause difficulties for current acoustic modelling software.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37226</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BEM workshop (Reading)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E06EA73-80B0-4C13-8878-645861F4A89A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop: &amp;quot;Boundary and finite element methods for high frequency scattering problems&amp;quot;, December 15th-16th 2014, Reading.

A two-day workshop bringing together mathematicians and engineers working on acoustic and electromagnetic scattering problems, to discuss recent progress in numerical methods for the solution of these problems. There was a particular focus on attempts to develop schemes that work well for high frequency problems, i.e. the case where the scattering obstacle is large compared to the wavelength of the incident wave. Both theoretical and practical issues were considered, with a key goal being to establish a better understanding of how recent theoretical progress may potentially be able to benefit more practical work. This was achieved via showcasing recent developments and by building links between mathematicians and engineers, potentially leading to future collaborative efforts. There was a large focus on boundary element methods, but domain based methods were also discussed.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.personal.reading.ac.uk/~sms03sl/HFBEMworkshop.htm</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through the research funded on this grant, we have developed new methods for the efficient solution of high frequency scattering problems. In particular, we have developed algorithms for which the number of degrees of freedom required to achieve a given accuracy does not depend in a significant way on the frequency, also efficient algorithms for evaluating the oscillatory integrals that arise. The work undertaken under this grant most significantly represents the fullest application to date of these ideas to three-dimensional problems. This represents a key step towards the development of methods for modelling realistic acoustic scenarios of practical interest.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The algorithms we have developed are pushing forward the range of applications to which our ideas can be applied. Further work is required before the ideas can be used to solve realistic problems arising in industrial applications, but with each new output we get closer to achieving that ultimate goal. Others can use our ideas to generate reference solutions for testing other approaches, also as a starting point for developing the algorithms further.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FC203442-5467-45C5-819A-BD8AFA04F339</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1821E1CF-5B10-4800-B7F8-E2578D34BF02"><gtr:id>1821E1CF-5B10-4800-B7F8-E2578D34BF02</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unified Transform for Boundary Value Problems: Applications and Advances</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6d7d6cb3f272d117c479d12472d2d7d1"><gtr:id>6d7d6cb3f272d117c479d12472d2d7d1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chandler-Wilde, S.
