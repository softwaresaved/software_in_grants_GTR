Community coordination will be facilitated through a series of workshops, where key technical challenges will be debated, providing input into the Challenge Network Strategy and relevant roadmaps. The Network will also compile and maintain a register of community capability, capital equipment and facilities. Sandpit events will aid the development of consortia to address specific research challenges, for example in response to calls from EPSRC or from the European Commission. Attendees at the sandpit events will be invited to participate in competitions for funding of feasibility projects, in particular to address new lines of research and to establish new consortia with complementary expertise. Knowledge transfer between the academic and industrial communities will be stimulated through two-way people exchange, supported by joint industry-Network funding. Outreach activities will include a website, representation at key national and international events and an annual community conference, held in conjunction with the Advanced Propulsion Centre Power Electronics Spoke.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries will include the academic and industrial members of the Network, their host organisations, the automotive industry, the broader scientific and industrial power electronic communities, and society in general. Timely application of power electronics technology will enable and accelerate the development and adoption of energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly technologies. In the target automotive sector, gaseous emissions and fossil fuel usage will be reduced, lower noise emissions will result and reliability will be enhanced, yielding direct environmental and economic benefits. In addition, there will be significant spill-over benefits in other areas. For example, in aerospace and rail transport, integrated power electronics will permit weight reduction and yield improved safety and reliability. In the energy sector, major opportunities are apparent in power quality control, in the renewable energy system market, in the emerging &amp;quot;smart grid&amp;quot;, and in the consumer appliances sector. 
UK-based technology and manufacturing capability is currently very strong in the power electronics sector. It is arguably one of the few areas in the electronics industry where the UK is internationally competitive across the whole supply chain (power device die, packaging, power modules, converters and drive systems). The expected migration from combustion engines to electrically-powered drive trains in the automotive sector will drive significant growth across the entire power electronics supply chain as it seeks to meet the new demand. Research stimulated by the Challenge Network will support innovation in this key technology, ensuring that the UK is well-positioned to grow its share of the market in the face of strong global competition.
In the short-term (1-5 years), the Network will generate stronger collaborative links within an expanding automotive power electronics community, leading to a clear research strategy and a portfolio of funded research. In the medium term (3-6 years), the knowledge gained from research activities initiated by the Network will underpin and supplement industry-led activities supported through related research programmes at TRL 4-6. In the longer term (6-15 years) the introduction of dramatically enhanced power electronic technologies will be of direct benefit to across the UK automotive supply chain, leading directly to wealth creation with job protection and growth. Manufacturers of power electronic modules and systems stand to gain benefit through expanded material/processing knowledge, an extended capability in high reliability packaging and integration and greater understanding of automotive system requirements. Improved design methodologies, life tests and standards will facilitate the design/product qualification process resulting in shorter time to market. Automotive system providers will benefit from early access to enhanced integration technologies and design methodology giving them a competitive advantage.
The publicity generated by the Network will raise public awareness of the role of power electronics and of engineering in general in society and contribute to future growth in students pursuing careers in science and engineering. Ultimately, the broader benefits to society will include improvements to the quality of life derived directly from the improved efficiency, flexibility and reliability of power electronics and indirectly from a reduced reliance on fossil fuels.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>843021</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Automotive Council Technology Group visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>784AA874-90E6-4037-9BBB-0AE44675D4FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The meeting included the regular Steering Group meeting of the ATG and was followed by input from Mark Johnson on the activities of the EPSRC Challenge Network in Automotive Power Electronics along with discussions on Low Carbon and Connected &amp;amp; Autonomous Vehicles,</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Roadmapping workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F4758F1B-4D8B-44C9-B1DC-B3EDF22DD277</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A roadmapping workshop aimed at updating the automotive power electronics roadmap.
