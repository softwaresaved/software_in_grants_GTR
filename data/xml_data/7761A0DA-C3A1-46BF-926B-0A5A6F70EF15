We discovered that PspCN, a polypeptide of microbial origin, &amp;quot;turbocharges&amp;quot; a human protein (CFH) that inhibits the complement cascade. Guided by the results of a market assessment, we now propose to design, manufacture and test PspCN-decorated surface coatings for medical implants. We aim to demonstrate that the PspCN displayed on these potentially protective coatings will grab hold of CFH, which is abundant in blood, and induce the captured CFH to switch from a latent to an activated form. Thus, in an improvement on the efforts of competitors to utilize CFH in its latent form, our approach will afford coated surfaces that are protected from the complement cascade by the patient's own, activated, CFH.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172806</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Enterprise</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Scottish Enterprise</gtr:description><gtr:id>029BBF52-1281-46B3-AFBF-FADC367DC095</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Exoertise, advice, the funding of salaries</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Andrew Herbert in my research team is spinning out a company</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>420365</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Medical Device Coatings (H-Guard) Phase 2</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Scottish Enterprise</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>PS7305CA45</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B8CED416-985E-4F19-8311-10F6308678D6</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>218000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Project Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Leverhulme Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>RPG-2015-109</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C5C176EA-C074-41F3-8742-56ABBD45BFF3</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Disclosed and claimed are: epitopic regions of Pneumococcal Surface Protein C or 'PspC', different clades of PspC, isolated and/or purified nucleic acid molecules such as DNA encoding a fragment or portion of PspC such as an epitopic region of PspC or at least one epitope of PspC, uses for such nucleic acid molecules, e.g., to detect the presence of PspC or of S. pneumoniae by detecting a nucleic acid molecule therefor in a sample such as by amplification and/or a polymerase chain reaction, vectors or plasmids which contain and/or express such nucleic acid molecules, e.g., in vitro or in vivo, immunological, immunogenic or vaccine compositions including at least one PspC and/or a portion thereof (such as at least one epitopic region of at least one PspC and/or at least one polypeptide encoding at least one epitope of at least one PspC), either alone or in further combination with at least one second pneumococcal antigen, such as at least one different PspC and/or a fragment thereof and/or at least one PspA and/or at least one epitopic region of at least one PspA and/or at least one polypeptide including at least one epitope of PspA.

We were hoping to emulate the bacterial complement-evasion strategy whereby FH is both irreversibly bound on the bacterial surface and held in a functionally enhanced form that ensures it acts as a potent blocker of C3b amplification and deposition. The ultimate aim was to attach the bacterial peptide onto the manmade surfaces lining medical devices as a means to protect them against damage from the two linked pathways of complement and clotting.

As planned we were able to immobilise the N-terminal domain of the D39 Streptococcus pneumoniae protein PspC (i.e. PspCN) to surfaces. We engineered N-terminal and C-terminal Cys (-SH) labelled versions and found the N-terminally labelled version performed better. We initially used maleimide-coated polystyrene multi-well plates to show that we could covalently attach SH-PspCN and use this to anchor factor H (detected by an anti-FH antibody). We were able to show convincing decreases in C3b deposition (monitored with an anti-C3b antibody) on the PspCN/FH-decorated surfaces compared to controls. 

We were subsequently able to immobilise PspCN on a range of other materials including polymers developed (by Mark Bradley's laboratory) for stent coatings that favour re-endothelialilasion of stent-damaged arterial segments. We were also able to illustrate the potential utility of PspCN on bare-metal stents by coating metal strips with PspCN. In suppression of complement activation assays (C3-deposition, C5b-9 formation) the coated strips easily outperformed uncoated ones.

Also in line with our objectives we looked at PspCN from other strains of S. pneumoniae. We found that certain truncations of TigR4 PspCN has very similar functions to D39 PspCN (including the anchoring and activating of FH), despite having only low sequence similarity. Indeed _none_ of the residues of TigR4 that were critical to its complex with FH (according to a crystal structure of the complex) were conserved in D39 PspCN. This was consistent with out hypothesis that FH can oscillate between different conformations, one of which is readily stabilised by binding of a protein to its modules 8-10, with the actual details of the binding being of only secondary importance. 

With potential therapeutic uses in mind, we also prepared PEGylated SH-PspCN, in line with our aims, and showed that it retained the biological properties of the non-PEGylated material. Our collaborators in the USA showed that our PEGylatd PspCN was less immunogenic than the nonPEGylatd version in mice. 

Our results were used to obtain further funding from Scottish Enterprise for development of &amp;quot;H-guard&amp;quot;, a PspCN-based coating for medical devices with novel anti-complement properties.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our attempts to spin-out a company making medical device coatings are well advanced and we have successfully obtained Phase II of Scottish Enterprise High-Growth Spinout funding.

The therapeutic use of PspC as an enhancer of Fh in age-related macular degeneration is an exciting possibility. We have a commercial partner who has funded PK studies in mice and NHPs (conducted by a CRO in the US).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>40DDE0DD-515E-4B7C-9030-465F316909AE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B2CA848D-23CF-4762-A312-57A55B9753E1"><gtr:id>B2CA848D-23CF-4762-A312-57A55B9753E1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Complement Evasion Mediated by Enhancement of Captured Factor H: Implications for Protection of Self-Surfaces from Complement.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d51ddea33c74777c1686c55b26873b9e"><gtr:id>d51ddea33c74777c1686c55b26873b9e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Herbert AP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1767</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B0BB8ED3-75EB-4770-8259-FFBFB4D9C852"><gtr:id>B0BB8ED3-75EB-4770-8259-FFBFB4D9C852</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structure of Complement C3(H2O) Revealed By Quantitative Cross-Linking/Mass Spectrometry And Modeling.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/44cc33ecf634ebc47e50139ceb78614c"><gtr:id>44cc33ecf634ebc47e50139ceb78614c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chen ZA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1535-9476</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/42BDA3E8-0535-497C-A6BD-58EB3C07276E"><gtr:id>42BDA3E8-0535-497C-A6BD-58EB3C07276E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Creating functional sophistication from simple protein building blocks, exemplified by factor H and the regulators of complement activation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biochemical Society transactions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0c54395becaa59e5d097298e33fa415f"><gtr:id>0c54395becaa59e5d097298e33fa415f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Makou E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0300-5127</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5DFA05C6-B152-4822-89E6-69CE11839FDA"><gtr:id>5DFA05C6-B152-4822-89E6-69CE11839FDA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparative Analysis of Novel Complement-Targeted Inhibitors, MiniFH, and the Natural Regulators Factor H and Factor H-like Protein 1 Reveal Functional Determinants of Complement Regulation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6e70f03c85d809c965975b91965c1bd6"><gtr:id>6e70f03c85d809c965975b91965c1bd6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harder MJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1767</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L024403/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
