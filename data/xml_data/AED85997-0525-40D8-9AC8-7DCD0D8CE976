The aim of this network is to investigate the current challenges in 3D X-Ray image processing and to develop the professional links of the early-career researchers with existing academic groups and industrial partners in this field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed network is focussed around the challenges and opportunities in the development of an integrated workflow for processing 3d X-ray data sets. To build a case for further support in the network's area, best practices will be investigated and a proof-of-concept 'data pipeline' will be constructed. The results of these exploratory studies will support scientific impact through joint publication and the development and distribution of new software tools.

As the techniques to be developed in the proposed research are 'material agnostic', the research will have an immediately impact on the broad user community for X-ray imaging facilities regardless of the application or scale under investigation. This includes applications in catalysis, electrochemical devices such as batteries or fuel cells, and nanotechnology. The research will also facilitate beamline scientists at large-scale capital investments in maximising the value extracted from these national resources, such as Diamond. These stakeholders will be engaged during the proposed site visits to national light sources, such as Diamond and SSRL, and through networking events in the proposed workshops.

The network will also work alongside X-ray instrument manufacturers, including Zeiss X-ray microscopy, to integrate our new analysis approaches with new developments in instrumentation and hardware. This will be facilitated through a site visit to explore and discuss mutual development opportunities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19355</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Aberdeen Sponsorship award workshop, August 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>493B5A22-B40D-4CA3-8876-D8AD96C79DA9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop on &amp;quot;Integrated approaches to X-Ray tomographic image processing&amp;quot; was held to network the investigators with researchers working in and around Aberdeen on relevant fields of study.

A new integrated approach to image-processing and image-based simulation of tomographic data sets has been scoped out with initial proof of concept work completed. This has been released as part of the visualisation package of DynamO, an open source simulation tool. The development of this code has allowed the investigators to develop the basis of a case for further funding to continue the research component of the network's activities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The code developed for the visualisation pipeline is freely available in beta form on GitHub, as part of the DynamO project, and released under an open source (GPL) licence.

This tool can be used to simulate key and fundamental models of particle systems and is the only publicly available code of its type. Currently it is mainly used to expand and test theoretical understanding of particle systems; however, DynamO also acts as a platform to drive the development of new models and algorithms which should revolutionise simulations of applied systems, particularly in solids handling and processing.

A more recent development of the DynamO project is an open-source scientific data visualisation tool, called Coil. This has broader application than particle simulation and can be used to create scientific and immersive VR renderings of data sets. This is the tool used to create the visualisations of DynamO simulations, but it is also used in tomographic visualisation (e.g., MRI, X-ray tomography, and seismic rendering). This development was supported by EPSRC grant EP/L026716/1.</gtr:description><gtr:id>95410651-4C4A-472D-9DC9-74F864AD808E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The software is in use by research groups across the world, and results obtained from the software have been published in several of the highest-impact journals for their fields (including Nature communication, Phys.
