and once downloaded, the interactive/multimedia e-book can be accessed in any space, without Internet connection. Illustrated with audio, video and theatrical memorabilia of various kinds, the interactive/multimedia e-books will be based on previous AHRC-funded research conducted by the APGRD team on the history of the ancient plays on the modern stage. 

As an internationally renowned centre for the study of the performance history of ancient drama, the APGRD has a unique and very rich collection of materials related to the performance of ancient drama from antiquity to the present. It is essential that its holdings are made more widely available and not simply accessible to those who can visit the Classics Centre in Oxford, as is currently the case. The interactive/multimedia e-books will enable us to work with brand-new technologies - tablet technology as a viewing platform for the e-book, for example, is only 4 years old. Using these cutting edge technologies, the interactive/multimedia e-book will not only expand our audience base; it will also enable us to communicate simultaneously with different types of audience, through the possibility of building different levels and pathways through the interactive/multimedia e-book. We will therefore be able to communicate with much younger audiences as well as extend our dialogue with theatre goers and practitioners around the globe, where the ancient plays enjoy equal prominence within the performance repertoire. 

The first of the interactive/multimedia e-books will be on Euripides' Medea, and will draw on and extend the content of the print volume Medea in Performance 1500-2000 (edited by Edith Hall, Fiona Macintosh and Oliver Taplin, Oxford 2000); and the second volume will be focused on Aeschylus' Agamemnon and will be built upon the contents of Agamemnon in Performance: 458 BC to AD 2005 (edited by Fiona Macintosh, Pantelis Michelakis, Edith Hall and Oliver Taplin, Oxford 2005). In multimedia/interactive form, the research contained within the print books will be considerably enhanced both by the use of theatrical ephemera, photographic, audio and video material already housed in the APGRD's collections and by newly commissioned interviews with theatre practitioners and scholars specialising in ancient drama and its afterlife on the stage in the modern world. The aim is ultimately to produce interactive/multimedia e-books to accompany all publications published by researchers at the APGRD (16 have been published to date) and to provide a platform for other projects to produce similar materials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Interactive/multimedia e-book technology will take our collection, our academic expertise and our experience in developing exhibitions to new audiences. It will enable us to provide practitioners, educators and the wider public interested in the culture of ancient Greece and Rome with a resource that describes the history and development of ancient plays in the modern world. That resource has to be digital for reasons of access, it has to be portable for ease of use, and it has to be engaging for a range of audiences. We want to provide theatre-goers, practitioners, and learners of all ages with a way to explore and experience our unique collection of performance history.

While the potential for digital exhibitions via conventional websites has been available for many years, compelling and interactive user experience in the form of an e-book is a new concept. Most websites require a laptop or desktop computer to use them; interactive multimedia e-books offer a new, innovative, convenient and portable way for users to interact directly with digital objects such as images, movies, text, visualisations. Audiences can now engage directly with digital objects, swiping, zooming and navigating the content in ways that permit a more tactile and less alienating interaction - one that simply was not possible 5 years ago without tablet computers and mobile devices.

In addition, because the e-book is downloaded, it does not require an Internet connection to run. This means that devices can be pre-loaded and used in situations where Internet access is unreliable, expensive, or difficult to administer, such as exhibition or performance spaces. Secondly, e-books offer a portable and community-developed content standard, in contrast to mobile applications ('apps'), which are expensive and difficult to maintain. Additionally, e-books can be distributed either via an online store (such as Amazon or the iTunes store), or they can also be downloaded from conventional websites. This allows the APGRD full control over the publication of its digital content, and enables us to make material available via a creative commons license without external restrictions. This will ensure that the e-book can be disseminated as widely as possible to maximize the value and reach of the impact generated.

After the end of the funding period, the e-books will continue to be available via the APGRD's website, via the e-book distributions systems employed (iBooks store, etc.). They will remain there while the current e-books standard is supported, which we estimate to be a period of beyond 5 years.

The digital objects that comprise the e-book, such as XML marked up text, images, video, etc., will be stored as archived digital objects in the Bodleian Library's ORA-Data system. The ORA-Data digital archive will hold a package containing the archive-quality form of the digital object, such as lossless PNG for images and WAV for audio files, the version used in the produced work, as well as metadata held in RDF format.

In addition, long-term archival versions of the e-books, using standard PDF technology, will be used to ensure that future users have access to the text content and images. These will be published on the APGRD website and stored in the ORA-Data system.

The project will also publish a set of best-practice guidelines, and aims to make freely available all of the software and technology developed in creating the e-books under a creative commons license. This is intended to provide other projects with a platform for producing similar materials.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80272</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The menu cards for the six chapters were designed by Thomas Cuschieri (Lecturer in Design, University of Hertfordshire).</gtr:description><gtr:id>5076216A-5C19-4FE0-BBFE-A99EFEEC62DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The view of the testers was unanimous that the chapter headings have been considerably enhanced by the illustrations.

Interactive/multimedia ebooks offer a new, innovative, convenient and portable way for users to interact directly with digital objects such as images, movies, text, visualisations. Our ebooks work without internet connection and are all freely downloadable. The ebooks will be available across two different platforms, with both an epub3 version and an ibook version. This ensures that the ebooks are available to all, regardless of the type of device a user prefers to view them on. In addition to allowing us to address broader accessibility issues, the epub3 version enables us to create a product suitable for dyslexic and visually impaired users. This will ensure that the ebooks can be disseminated as widely as possible to maximize the value and reach of the impact generated. 

Our testers have been drawn from the creative industries, from education and from the wider public. The feedback has not only been invaluable in the final editorial stages, it has also been enormously encouraging. I list below a few, representative comments from our sample (designating in broad terms the occupation of the tester):
a) 'I am absolutely not an academic and have only a glancing acquaintance with the Medea story but after I finished the ebook I felt as though I knew it really well and felt quite emotionally invested in her if that makes sense! ' (Resident of Bangladesh - theatre-goer)
b) 'I think it is beautifully put together, incredibly engaging, visually stunning, and very interactive! It will appeal to a wide-range of people and ages, which is exactly what you are looking for.' (Schools Liaison Officer, University of Oxford)
c) 'I've just spent a very enjoyable morning with your ebook. What a fantastic end result - I love it! Really looking forward to being able to share it with my students when the final version is out.' 
(Open University Lecturer, Classics)
d) 'Wow! This is a fantastic. You've all done something quite brilliant here. So rich, so accessible and so interesting. Great use of media. What an exceptional book! Love it.' (Film Maker/Writer, London)
e) 'I really enjoyed reading this book even though I do not study classics or latin. I thought it gave and interesting insight into the different opinions and interpretations of the story in literature and drama and how the story has been interpreted throughout history, and found the interactive features, such as the videos and pictures, fun to use and engaging. This book seems perfect for those studying classics/latin and the story of medea. The quotes, audio and videos, artwork and insight into the different dramatical and literary interpretations gives you a whole new perspective on the classic story and make it very memorable.'

This is intended to provide other projects with a platform for producing similar materials.

We have discovered that there is a market for interactive/multimedia ebooks both within the educational sector (post 16 and within higher education) and amongst the theatre-going public and we are ahead of the curve in filling it.

We have also discovered that digitising our collection and commissioning new artefacts, interviews and performances to enhance our previous print publications is in line with other developments within the publishing industry, where 'repurposing' books for new audiences is very much a priority.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The toolkit/best practice guidelines that we have developed and issited on the APGRD website will enable others to develop interactive/multimedia ebooks with ease. Dr Kenward, the APGRD Archivist/Developer is taking the lead on the Agamemnon, a performance history volume because she has now acquired the necessary skills to work in ibooks after twelve months on the project working alongside Dr Tom Wrobel (the project's Developer/Curator) and Chris Jennings (the project's Media Consultant Developer). Chris Jennings will again convert the ibook to ePub3 format for accessibility reasons.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4F28153B-561C-436A-B5B4-27092850DF50</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Shaping publishing policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BB65FDC-193C-471C-BD5A-1CF10CB1B18C</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Repurposing the academic book for new audiences</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>18B0D284-CA9D-47C1-9725-AA3BBADB92D3</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The toolkit consists of a best-practice guide for interactive/multimedia ebook development.
