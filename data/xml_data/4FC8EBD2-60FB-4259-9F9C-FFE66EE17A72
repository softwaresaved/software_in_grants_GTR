Roberts-Jones (1913-1996)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/H038973/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project seeks to enhance understanding of post-1945 public sculpture in Britain through the first in-depth critical study of the artistic production of Welsh-born sculptor Ivor Roberts-Jones RA (1913-1996): a founder member, in 1953, of the Society of Portrait Sculptors and a champion of traditional figurative sculptural forms. During his career Roberts-Jones was held in high esteem by his artistic peers, within the Royal Academy and by the public at large, for major public commissions in bronze such as: the Augustus John Memorial at Fordingbridge in Hampshire (1964-67), the full-length figure of Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, London (1970-73) and the full-length figure of Field Marshal Viscount Slim in Parliament Street, London (1987-1990). \n\nHis work regularly featured in prominent exhibitions of sculpture embracing a wide variety of media supported by the Arts Council and he received over 25 commissions from the National Museum of Wales to produce portrait heads and busts of prominent Welsh personalities over a quarter of a century. He, furthermore, proved an influential teacher: students of his have produced major UK public sculptures such as: the National Women's Memorial, London by J.W. Mills (2005) and Sir John Betjeman, St. Pancras Railway Station by M. Jennings (2007). In spite of his sculptural achievements and legacy, Roberts-Jones's significant contribution to post-1945 British art and accompanying debates on nation, commemoration, and the purpose of public art, has received surprisingly little scholarly attention. \n\nBased upon extensive original archival research, including unpublished artist's letters, drawings, annotated photographs and sculpture models, this project will examine the view widely aired at his death that Roberts-Jones produced some of the most impressive and memorable examples of major commemorative public sculpture in bronze in post -1945 Europe. For the first time, his portraiture - in the collections of the National Museum of Wales, the National Portrait Gallery and the Tate Gallery, London - and his public memorials will be properly assessed within a Western European modernist sculptural tradition that embraces such distinguished practitioners as: Maillol, Epstein, Frink, Marini and Belsky. In addition, the series of subtle heads of blind subjects Roberts-Jones produced in bronze and plaster between the 1960's and '80's, will be related to a 20th Century tradition of portraiture developed by Fautrier as well as to contemporary debates exploring how the unsighted, or partially sighted, imagine their facial appearance: - what Roberts-Jones termed their 'private geographies.' \n\nThe project examines Roberts-Jones's portraiture and public commemorative work in relation to current debates surrounding: the nature of 'Britishness'; the evolution of Welsh national identity; the problematic relationship between public art and Britain's imperial past (especially with respect to his imagining of Winston Churchill), and the contribution his monumental figuration made to the formulation of an officially sponsored discourse of supposedly 'heroic' normative masculinity such as his figures of WWII Field Marshals Slim and Alanbrooke. The impact Roberts-Jones had on the future development of representational trends within British sculpture, in his capacity as Head of Sculpture at Goldsmith's College, will also be explored. An assessment will be provided of the artist's legacy and his continuing relevance in relation to the public commemorative sculpture through such contemporary practitioners as N. Boonham, E. Milner, J.W. Mills and M. Jennings.\n\nThe project will include a series of national and regional exhibitions and displays with accompanying texts, public talks and 2 one-day conferences, It will culminate in a display at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. Through this means, maximised by media coverage, research will be disseminated to an exceptionally broad audience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Designed to benefit an unusually wide range of audiences through a carefully managed programme of ongoing dissemination and engagement, this project will ensure maximum impact through 5 public exhibitions and displays of Roberts-Jones' work with accompanying catalogues/leaflets and public talks, alongside 2 accessible conferences, a major publication on the artist, and 2 journal articles. Key beneficiaries beyond academia are the museum and gallery sector, archivists and librarians, further education staff and students, and the wider public interested in art, national and local history, heritage, and visiting museums and galleries. \n\nThe ongoing programme of research dissemination and impact is centred on 5 public exhibitions/displays proposed from October 2011 to February 2013 at Fordingbridge Museum (Hampshire) Churchill College (Cambridge), Henry Moore Institute (Leeds), Society of Portrait Sculptors (London) and National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth). Specific benefits are as follows: \n\n- Teaching staff and school/college students will be directly engaged through exhibitions/displays designed to appeal to Higher and Secondary Education sectors. Working with each institution as already agreed, the PI and RA will co-ordinate accompanying display/exhibition material (leaflets and catalogues), a series of public talks and educational visits which focus on aspects of Roberts-Jones's work that directly relate to curricula content in history, art, politics and media studies, and two one-day conferences in Leeds and Aberystwyth exploring respectively the changing nature of portrait sculpture in the 20th Century, and public art and Welsh national identity c.1900-present day.. \n\n- museums, galleries, librarians and archive staff will directly benefit from the new knowledge and research expertise generated through collaborating with the PI and RA on curating of exhibitions/displays on specific aspects of their collections which profile their rich local and national importance. These will engage diverse communities through accompanying public talks by the PI and RA, the production of leaflets/illustrated catalogues, the co-organisation of two conferences, and audience evaluation. The Robert-Jones publication, 2 refereed articles, online published talks, and the depositing of archival material at each institution will ensure a continuing legacy and impact beyond the project's lifetime. \n\n- the wider public interested in art, national and local history and heritage will have access to the research generated during the ongoing phrases of the project from the initial webpages announcing the project; the different exhibitions/displays held in 5 UK venues (including the display of Robert-Jones portraiture at Society of Portrait Sculptors' annual exhibition in Cork Street, London), accompanying display leaflets/illustrated catalogues, public talks and conferences. All events will be supported by media publicity developed in close collaboration with Kingston University's Press office. Target audiences will include local societies, library and museum users, and gallery visitors. The PI and RA will collaborate with each institution to ensure the widest possible audience engagement and evaluation. \n\nOngoing impact post-award with be ensured by depositing of archival material at each institution, online publications, and the publication and promotion of Roberts-Jones Monograph/Catalogue Raisonn&amp;eacute; in spring 2013 by Philip Wilson Publishers London (agreement in place if grant awarded). A publisher of well-designed and well-received studies of British 20th-Century artists/ art movements available through on-line outlets and principle booksellers. \n\nDuring the past 5 years the PI has curated a number of high-profile exhibitions of 20th-Century art/artists within a variety of venues and has an established publications record.

My talk also provided biographical details concerning the sculptor Roberts-Jones, how his career developed after his figure of John was unveiled in October 1967 by Admiral of the Fleet, Lord Louis Mountbatten.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.fordingbridgemuseum.co.uk/news.php</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ivor Roberts-Jones and Yehudi Menuhin</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C0D9970-EBCB-435D-B784-4FED453EED19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 30 Minute public lecture given at the Society of Portrait Sculptors, Cork Street, London about Roberts-Jones's portrait head of the musician and conductor

My lecture which lasted for about an hour explored Williams's friendship from the late 1940's until the artist's death in 1996 with the sculptor Ivor Roberts-Jones. Particular attention was paid to the three portrait heads of Williams produced by Roberts-Jones in bronze and plaster between the mid-1950's and mid-1960's and to public/private commissions Williams helped the sculptor to secure from the early 1960's to the early 1990's</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.highgatecalandar.org/event/kyffin-williams-lecture</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper for Tate Britain Conference: 'Exhibiting Contemporary Art in Post-War Britain, 1945-60.'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5CCA6EBB-556D-4083-AF09-F74D158CCD8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a twenty minute paper entitled 'Flying The Flag for Figuration: The Beaux Arts Gallery and the Promotion of the Kitchen Sink Movement in Art' for a Conference held 28-29 January 2016 at Tate Britain and organised by the Education Department at Tate Britain and the Paul Mellon Centre for British Art. An important part of my paper explored the relationship in the 1950's between sculptor Ivor Roberts-Jones and Helen Lessore - owner of the Beaux Arts Gallery. My paper also touched on Lessore's efforts to promote the work of some of Roberts-Jones's British/European contemporaries such as Daphne Hardy, Elizabeth Frink, Frank Dobson, Marino Marini and Giacomo Manzu within the context of her active promotion of the so-called 'Kitchen Sink' group of oil painters. At the beginning of the Conference Roberts-Jones was not an artist known to the majority of the speakers and to the audience. However, by its end, from comments made by fellow speakers and some members of the audience, it was clear that they now saw the sculptor in a new and much more positive light. They were also more prepared to entertain the thought that the Kitchen Sink movement was not restricted to painting but did indeed possess a lively and thought-provoking sculptural dimension.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.tate.org.uk/what's-on/tate-britain/conference</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture on Ivor Roberts-Jones and his Statues of Sir Winston Churchill for the Institute of Art History, Budapest</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B8A2A357-0014-402C-B58E-DFD61894D6C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lengthy discussion after my lecture as to status of public sculpture in Hungary today; what should be done, if anything, to safeguard public sculpture produced during the country's discredited Communist era (1945-90) as well as what problems may arise from the contemporary commissioning of public sculpture by still controversial figures from the country's past such as former dictator Admiral Miklos Horthy (1919-44) - a hero to many within the Hungarian Right today but not to other sigificant sections of the population.

Also the publication of a revised and expanded brochure by HMSO: 'The Attlee Memorial Statue in the House of Commons'.

Part of my research for this project has also been used for a section in my forthcoming study of Winston Churchill in British Art c. 1900 to the present day which comments how Ivor Roberts-Jones depicted Churchill in sculpture in London's Parliament Square (1973) and in New Orleans, USA (1977).

And factual material underpinning:
One exhibition at the National Museum of Wales ('The Double Edge: The Portrait Sculpture of Ivor Roberts-Jones', December 2013-May 2014)
and
Two displays; one focussing on his Whitehall Statue of Field Marshal Viscount Slim (Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, April-June 2014) and the second on his statue of Clement Attlee in the Members Lobby of the House of Commons (Portcullis House, Palace of Westminster, October-December 2014).

Also for a display at the Fordingbridge Museum, Hampshire, focussing on the bronze statue of painter Augustus John which Roberts-Jones made for the town in c. 1966-67 and which was unveiled in October 1967. The display opened at the end of March 2015 and is located at the entrance to the Museum's first floor. It consists of four illustrated panels exploring: John's connection with the town (from 1927 he lived nearby at Fryan's Court); the career of Ivor Roberts-Jones (selected to make the statue in spring 1964); the story of the statue's commission and, finally, why the statue's current location is different to its originally selected site. Text and imagery for the panels was provided by myself. The production of the panels was funded by money from my original AHRC Roberts-Jones Award set aside for this specific purpose.

Plus the content of five public lectures; to the Institute of Art History, Hungarian Academy of Science, Budapest (October 2012); the Czech and Slovak Association of Great Britain (April 2013); the Society of Portrait Sculptors, London (May 2013); the Fifth Annual Sir Kyffin Williams Lecture at Highgate School, London (February 2015) and for Fordingbridge Museum Trust, Fordingbridge, Hampshire (March 2015).

Part of my research into Roberts-Jones was utilised in a lecture I gave in June 2015 at the Henry Moore Institute for the Study of Sculpture, Leeds, exploring the presentation of the image of Sir Winston Churchill in Sculpture.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>950FBF0A-E101-4B99-891E-B3C81854DC67</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research has greatly added to our general understanding of the life, career and sculptural output of Ivor Roberts-Jones (1913-1996).
