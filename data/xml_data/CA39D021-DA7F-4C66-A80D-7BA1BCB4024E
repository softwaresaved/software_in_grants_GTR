The motion can occur only in one of the patterns called &amp;quot;natural modes&amp;quot; by which that particular instrument could vibrate. 
How fast the instrument vibrates in each of the natural modes is characterized by the &amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot; of that mode,
so that the higher is the frequency the higher is pitch of the sound we hear. Apart from the frequency each mode 
is characterized by its &amp;quot;quality factor&amp;quot; which is a measure of duration of sound until it dies out beyond the audibility level. 

Musical instruments is one of the basic examples of devices called resonators, but resonance phenomena 
are wide-spread in Nature and in fact underpin a lot of modern Science and Technology.
 For example, in much the same way as musical instruments, complex atomic nuclei (as for example uranium, plutonium or thorium) 
&amp;quot;vibrate&amp;quot; in one of their natural modes when hit in experiments by a fast-moving particle used to probe inner structure of the nuclei. 
The set of all natural frequencies of any physical object is called the &amp;quot;spectrum&amp;quot;. Spectra are important characteristics of any
object and can reveal a lot about its structure and properties. Spectra of musical instruments are very ordered (or &amp;quot;harmonic&amp;quot;) to produce
pleasing sounds, whereas experiments show that spectra of complex atomic nuclei look disordered, or random, which reflects a very complicated,
chaotic and unpredictable character of motion of nuclei constituents. But behind all that &amp;quot;spectral disorder&amp;quot; lurks a certain pattern which represents
a new &amp;quot;harmony&amp;quot; in the Nature. For example, the same pattern reveals itself in positions of birds perching on a roof or in distances between closely
parked cars. Or indeed in the positions of zeroes of a function introduced by German mathematician Bernhard Riemann to study properties of one
of the main building blocks of Mathematics - the prime numbers. To be able to characterize such ubiquitous
patterns quantitatively mathematicians use as a model idealized objects called random matrices. Spectral properties of such matrices are encapsulated 
in a function called characteristic polynomial of the matrix. When plotted graphs of such functions show huge random variations by the orders of magnitude reflecting random nature of the associated spectra. To characterize such variations statistically in a rigorous mathematical way is a challenging 
mathematical problem. The present project aims to address various facets of statistical behaviour of random characteristic polynomials. 
As almost invariably happens in Mathematics, tools introduced to understand a certain phenomenon help to reveal many other hidden structures in problems not obviously related to the original one. The theory of random matrices is rich with such unexpected connections. In particular, the present research aims to employ random characteristic polynomials for analysing behaviour of systems of differential equations used describe, among other things, ecological communities of many interacting species and possibly dynamics of networks of interacting neurons. Related characteristic polynomials
may be helpful for understanding properties of spectra of complex atomic nuclei and similar systems, in particular the associated &amp;quot;quality factors&amp;quot; which are known in that context as &amp;quot;widths of resonances&amp;quot;. All these questions are to be addressed in the course of the proposed research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The UK boasts a strong research-active environment in all aspects of the Random Matrix theory and applications.
 The present proposal aims therefore to add in a non-trivial way to the diversity of the existing UK research landscape
 in this area and to the available pool of the UK expertise.
In particular, the proposed research on 1/f noises is intimately related to the Gaussian Free Field context, 
with the latter identified as one of significant areas where the UK research is only ''thinly represented&amp;quot; (International Review of Mathematical Sciences 2010). Implementation of the project should help to maintain, and further invigorate research in the UK at the boundary between Mathematical/Theoretical Physics and Probability. In this way the project aims to 
underpin the EPSRC strategy of increasing the research capacity in 
areas related to applications of probabilistic methods and concepts to Science. Many UK-based researchers working on
related problems will benefit directly or indirectly from the outcomes of the proposed research,
 e.g. Dr. N. Berestycki (Cambridge), Dr. C. Hughes (York), Drs. P. Vivo and I. Wigman (Kings College), 
Prof. N. O'Connell (Warwick), Profs. J.P. Keating and F. Mezzadri (Bristol), Dr. I. Krasovsky (Imperial),
Prof. H. Schomerus (Lancaster), Prof. O. Zaboronski (Warwick), to name just a few.
 In a more distant perspective the results on extrema of 1/f noises and logarithmically-correlated 
random fields may appear to be useful for problems in electronic and acoustic engineering, 
financial analysis, optimization problems, climate research and in pattern recognition studies.

Some elements of Random Matrix Theory, 1/f noises, multifractal processes and the Random Landscape Paradigm may be suitable topics for public outreach activities, like popular science lectures. For example, finding the minimum in a complicated landscape may be used as a visualisation of optimisation problems where there are many &amp;quot;almost optimal&amp;quot; solutions (e.g. travelling salesman problem or optimizing the design of a microchip). 
 On the other hand the paradigm of resonance phenomena is also in the core of our technology, with applications ranging from musical instruments to lasers. This all could be used as a background helping to engage public into discussions and to promote the idea of an uninhibited research culture as one of the fundamental values intrinsic for contemporary civilisation and beneficial for all strata of modern society.

Finally, the project involves two postdoctoral researchers, who will both acquire sophisticated research skills at the interface between Mathematical/Theoretical Physics and Probability. These skills are highly transferable and can be applied to multitude of problems. This should both enhance the career prospects of the team members and benefit their future employers and collaborators
 in the academic or commercial sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>477893</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>So far I have developed (i) a better understanding of statistics of high and extreme values (the highest peak, next highest peak, etc.) for random sets of data which emerge
