Such provinces represent the eruption of phenomenal volumes of basaltic lavas, which spread over the surface to fill and occupy hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. Understanding how these provinces were formed is of great significance to several topics, including the origins of voluminous volcanism (so-called large igneous provinces - LIPs) on Earth, the storage of magmas beneath the Earth's surface, and mass extinctions. One notable feature of flood basalt provinces is that the vents for the lavas are very poorly understood, as very few examples have been described, and these are all from the same province, the 'small', young (15 million-years-old) Columbia River basalts, USA. In the western Deccan province, such flood basalt lava flows reach exposed thicknesses of well over a kilometre and provide an excellent opportunity to understand many of the outstanding questions pertaining to flood basalt volcanism, including locating the vents and their related volcanic deposits. Our study will investigate the nature of flood basalt vent sites in a certain area of the Deccan province where some examples are already known to exist, and in which there are a number of feeder dykes (high-level, sheet-like intrusions of magma into Earth's upper crust). The dykes are testimony that magma rose towards the surface in this region, and lava vents are related to these dykes. The flows fed by these vents may be some of the biggest volcanic eruptive units on Earth, but this remains to be tested. By combining the expertise of an experienced investigator who has worked on one of the vent systems in the Columbia River flood basalt province with a relatively new Indian researcher with detailed knowledge of the vital part of the Deccan province, we hope to build up a convincing picture of the source region of some of these great lava flows and of the types of volcanoes that may have been built there. Thus, the work proposed will also bear on an old, yet incompletely resolved, issue in geology, that of the nature of the source regions of the flood basalt lava flows. This debate goes back to the 1880s, the main point being whether flood basalt lavas in LIPs were fed from central volcanoes or from widely dispersed fissures. Some LIPs, for example, the CRB province, appear to be entirely fissure-fed, but the Deccan may be different? We have very little direct knowledge about the actual eruptive vent processes in continental flood basalt volcanism because the deposits are so elusive, and this proposed research will try to provide that evidence and also answer some major questions, such as the nature and size of flood basalt eruptions; were they small and frequent or large and infrequent in this region of the Deccan province? The project depends on detailed mapping and collection of field data, without which issues such as understanding the precise eruption style of flood basalts will remain unsolved. Deccan volcanism coincides in time with one of the largest mass extinctions that this planet has ever witnessed, in which the reign of the dinosaurs was ended. But did the volcanism have anything to do with the extinction, or was the extinction largely the result of a meteoritic impact? It has only recently begun to be recognised that flood basalt eruptions feature fire-fountain activity at the vents. It seems unavoidable that sufficiently large fire-fountains must be topped by vigorously rising ash plumes, capable of transporting noxious gases high into the atmosphere. Around the vents, distinctive volcanic deposits develop. Making detailed observations of volcanic vent deposits preserved in this one part of the Deccan lava field will be a major step towards our understanding of the potential for this volcanism to cause regional or global environmental change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>265952</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Researchers working on aspect of flood basalt magmatism, particularly in the Deccan and Columbia River provinces, have cited our published outputs and built on our work to progress understanding of such magmatism and its environmental impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>95EC8692-B018-413C-B11E-C85E525797A3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. We have provided the first geological maps and detailed physical descriptions of the proximal (near-vent) pyroclastic deposits, lava flows and dikes of a flood basalt eruption (the 1500 km3 15 Ma, Roza Member, CRBP). Surface outcrops and dikes were investigated in detail along a 180 km-long section of the Roza fissure system, yielding an unparalleled understanding of the surface and near-surface architecture of a flood basalt fissure system. 

2. We have identified and described nine previously unrecognised vents, bringing the total discovered so far for the Roza Member to seventeen. This extends the known length of the Roza fissure system 30 km north (to a maximum of 180 km) and establishes a clear change in the dike system's propagation direction of 23&amp;deg;, from NNW-SSE to NW-SE. We have been able to attribute this change in orientation to it crossing the continental suture between accreted oceanic terranes and the North American craton. This is the first documented example of a major re-orientation of a dike fissure system across a crustal boundary. 

3. We have provided the first detailed geological and structural maps and physical descriptions of pyroclastic constructs (cones and ramparts) of a flood basalt eruption. We found that each vent is characterised by a complex succession of variably welded spatter and scoria, shelly pahoehoe lavas and clastogenic lavas. This has allowed the reconstruction of the original dimensions and extents of pyroclastic constructs along the fissure and comparison with those built during smaller volume basaltic eruptions (e.g., Laki 1783-4 eruption, Iceland). Textural analysis of bubble size distributions in remarkably well-preserved pyroclasts has allowed the style of eruption to be determined.

4. We have extensively sampled the known and newly discovered proximal pyroclastic deposits and dikes and obtained &amp;gt;70 whole rock major and trace element analyses. This has allowed us to compositionally link lava subtypes of the Roza Member (e.g., those identified by Martin, 1988) with vent segments, complexes and dikes, significantly increasing the eruption resolution within the Roza Member.

5. We have discovered new processes that occur in near-vent regions that result from the interaction between effusive products (lavas) and explosive products (pyroclastic deposits). These processes result from the deposition of tephra sheets onto actively inflating and/or advancing lava flow fields and are considered likely during flood basalt eruptions due to their extended duration and the simultaneous eruption of lavas and pyroclasts from numerous vents along a fissure. The processes result in complications to proximal deposit stratigraphy but provide novel time markers for unravelling the pace of flow field emplacement.

6. We have developed a conceptual model for the temporal evolution of a flood basalt eruption along a basaltic fissure system, based on the mapped spatial distributions and extents of emitted products (lavas and pyroclastic deposits). This model can be applied and tested at other basaltic fissure systems and used to bolster understanding of the environmental impacts of flood basalt eruptions through release of fine ash, sulfur and other volatiles into the atmosphere.

7. We investigated the near-surface (&amp;lt; 600 m depth) plumbing system architecture of large fissure eruptions through detailed work on feeder dikes; we discovered that dikes exhibit shallow-level features not commonly reported (margin-parallel, symmetric vesicular bands; highly vesicular interiors; extreme flattening of shards close to margin). Microprobe analyses of glassy dike margins revealed moderate S contents consistent with depth of exposure deduced from geological maps. 

8. The topic of flood basalt eruptions reaches widely into our understanding of the Earth as a system, touching on mantle processes, deep Earth-volcano-climate interactions, and on the resilience of life on the planet during such enormous volcanic events. Almost all research on flood basalt volcanism prior to this project has focussed on the effusive products, petrogenesis of the lavas, or the potential environmental impacts of the volcanism in general. Little attention has been paid to the pyroclastic deposits and the vents which can provide important information that feeds into debates about eruption longevity, eruptive dynamics, and ultimately on the eruption's efficacy at emitting deleterious volatiles into the atmosphere. This research provides the first detailed description of flood basalt vents and therefore provides important eruptive constraints that will be of wide appeal and importance within Earth Science.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The constraints on the eruptive mechanisms of flood basalt lavas and their pyroclastic phases will be used by researchers to model the environmental impacts of such eruptions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4F9EC17D-4C03-4491-AB8E-AB78FBE7BD95</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution to Cabinet Office workshop</gtr:description><gtr:id>C177A087-86FD-4F40-8FA5-E00F654C3623</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Member of workshop and expert elicitation on impact of Laki-type eruption on the UK, Cabinet Office (May 2012)</gtr:impact></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D23374E0-3895-470D-83EF-ECA6949C1060"><gtr:id>D23374E0-3895-470D-83EF-ECA6949C1060</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;acute;A&amp;acute;a lava flows in the Deccan Volcanic Province, India, and their significance for the nature of continental flood basalt eruptions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Bulletin of Volcanology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7e04229fc4fa050f79695f1c5e879684"><gtr:id>7e04229fc4fa050f79695f1c5e879684</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A83FBEEE-0516-4636-99C7-FFAD7D51BDF3"><gtr:id>A83FBEEE-0516-4636-99C7-FFAD7D51BDF3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pyroclastic edifices record vigorous lava fountains during the emplacement of a flood basalt flow field, Roza Member, Columbia River Basalt Province, USA</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geological Society of America Bulletin</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7e04229fc4fa050f79695f1c5e879684"><gtr:id>7e04229fc4fa050f79695f1c5e879684</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BB32FA0B-9AF0-478F-80F0-B92BD67E78DC"><gtr:id>BB32FA0B-9AF0-478F-80F0-B92BD67E78DC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disruption of tephra fall deposits caused by lava flows during basaltic eruptions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Bulletin of Volcanology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7e04229fc4fa050f79695f1c5e879684"><gtr:id>7e04229fc4fa050f79695f1c5e879684</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/E019021/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>052183D5-AB83-4C5E-97FA-7B0C1D4AF3FA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>95</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Volcanic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
