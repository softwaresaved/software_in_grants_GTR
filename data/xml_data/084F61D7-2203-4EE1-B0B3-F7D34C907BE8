The project will capture collaborative work initiated by the innovative UnBox Fellowships. It will feature a variety of creative voices and modes of working and make these available through an open-access on-line resource. 

Goa based organisation 'People Tree' identified the value of a sustainable 'map' of Mapusa Market based on a set of exciting and innovative creative responses to the market. Mapping Mapusa Market creatively expands from this vision to investigate how a physically contained but multi-layered public space can be vividly and informatively mapped in ways other than through conventional topographical mapping. It will explore how an interdisciplinary team of creative practitioners can contribute to this process and how material can be published through an open access on-line resource. It will explore what value can be brought to this process through the co-creation of knowledge by collaborators from different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, drawn both from academia and professional practice, from the creative industries and the business environment. 

Mapusa Market is both a typical Indian market, and distinctive and unique. As a commercial organism, the market attracts local traders as well as merchants from adjoining states. Every Friday it swells to accommodate hundreds of daily vendors who set up improvised pitches selling home-grown produce, delicacies, spices and toddy. The vast array of merchandise available is reflected in the range of visitors including Goans and local and international tourists who come to do business, browse, socialise, catch up on gossip on or to experience the vibrant atmosphere. The Market can also be understood as an affinity space where the exchange of a range of specialist knowledge takes place, much of it about repairing items that would be discarded elsewhere but are given a new lease of life here. Much of this knowledge is likely to be lost over coming decades. 

Whilst Mapusa market is self-evidently a thriving commercial environment with fierce competition for space and a bustling and prosperous dynamic, it is also a fragile organism: India is strategically opening up to direct foreign investment (FDI) and the inevitable arrival of large supermarkets means that India's local markets will soon face the same challenges as their global counterparts.

To create the map of this vibrant cultural accumulation, a range of market users including shoppers, day vendors and market workers will chart their 'market walk'. Whether portering goods, scouting for trade or browsing for souvenirs each participant will create a vivid picture of their experience of the market. Using specially designed tools for creative production, the project will build up a series of vivid 'cross-sectional' views. Organised into a cohesive body of work and uploaded onto a website that also invites contributions from others, the project will explore the market both as a nexus of cultural, commercial and social relationships, a hub for cultural production and an exciting physical place.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19967</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This new selection of images of the Mapping Mapusa Market research project was published on the AHRC Image Gallery during January 2016.

Researchers Bahbak Hashemi-Nezhad, Stanzin Losal and Andrew Burton worked with project partner, Orijit Sen, Director of People Tree to create a series of workshops and live interventions that aimed to open up new perspectives on this dynamic and vibrant - but vulnerable - space. Mapping Mapusa Market involved the generation of new creative works including performances, murals, videos and sculpture. These works have been 'mapped' onto a new website that invites further contributions. The creative products are therefore a series of temporary artworks and artefacts which are mapped onto the Mapusa Market website 

The project began with market users devising 'their' walk through the market. Whether carrying goods, scouting for trade or browsing souvenirs, each walk had a special purpose based on their creators' individual knowledge, experience or expectations.

As the research developed, this set of 'cross-sectional views' was extended with works created by new participants. These works, plotted onto a topographical view of the market on the Mapping Mapusa Market website, represents a range of creative responses, charting Mapusa market as a nexus of cultural, commercial and social relationships. Through this process the project extends knowledge of this uniquely vibrant, complex and dynamic hub of commerce and cultural production.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2957FFDD-AF10-4990-AA4F-3DB484923F9A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of early research, in 2013 Goa University offered Project Partner Orijit Sen the newly established Mario Miranda Chair of Design based at the University's Mapusa campus, thus presenting an opportunity for the project to develop further within an Indian academic context. 

Local collaborators and participants in the project have continued to create material and add this to the website (as well as creating their own parallel websites) demonstrating a continuing interest in the project's theme 

A wide audience, including artists, academics and students, has been engaged through seminars, lectures and workshops. Hashemi-Nezhad presented the project at 'Designing Futures' ICA, London. Burton discussed the project at a talk and Q and A session at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Art, Norwich, at a lecture in the 'Materials Library' series at Bergen Academy for Art and Design . The project will be presented at a forthcoming lectures at Wolverhampton and Sheffield Hallam Universities and at the Serpentine Gallery in London; at a symposium at Kingston University on mapping informal spaces and at a practical workshop and at an Art and Heritage conference both at Newcastle University. 
Participation in the Alchemy Festival brought the research to a wider international audience affording them the opportunity to explore live 'mapping' with the camera rig specially designed for the project. 

The Project has impacted on its many participants, introducing them to creative research methodologies, deepening knowledge and appreciation of an important - and vulnerable - local resource and by broadening horizons: &amp;quot;It was exciting to see perceptions of the market change and participants beginning to find aspects and stories of the market previously unknown. It was fascinating when discussions evolved into debates around Goan culture, the predominant presence of women in the market, the unique culture of bread, or the presence of migrant workers. These discussions really moved the project forward and kept redefining the project's parameters. (workshop participant)

In India, the project has encouraged its participants to engage in further creative work</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Mapping Mapusa Market</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.mapusamarket.net/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>People Tree</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mapping Mapusa Market</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5DC6ADA-415E-4590-8173-C045C8AAD2F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mapping Mapusa Market website

I learnt a lot about formulating a research project, making successful collaborations, how to deal with an evolving and dynamic subject of research like Mapusa Market and about different ways of approaching and thinking about a multi-faceted project. I gained a new understanding of Goa, with its unique colonial history within the larger context of India. Due to my upbringing, I have always felt strongly about the class divide. Lower income groups see a different reality compared to my own and the fact that I never had the opportunity to really engage with them meant that there was a lot I did not know about who they are, where they're from, their perception. The fact that the project was based in a market, engaging its occupants intensively, where most of the day vendors were from low income groups, a lot of them doing the same trade over a long time, made me feel closer to their reality - before which I had a limited understanding.
The project has made me, as an indian, more critical of the fast changing commercial environment of india, where for example the trend of an all encompassing super market has emerged for the upper classes.
