&lt;br /> This project tests an account we developed in a previous ESRC project (called JANUS, because it claims the interpretation of referring expressions depends on both text that has gone before and text that is about to come). The project uses a technique called Event Related Potentials (ERPs), in which electrical activity on the scalp provides information about mental processes. In particular, inexplicable or anomalous content in a sentence produces a characteristic pattern of electrical activity shortly after the critical word (called N400). JANUS claims that overspecific referring expressions are mildly anomalous and should produce N400 activity. An alternative account, Almor?s Informational Load Hypothesis (ILH) claims the problem lies in short-term memory overload, which is associated with a different pattern of electrical activity.

Coherence is, at least partly, created by repeated reference to the same people and objects. Repeated reference, particularly to important characters or things that are currently at the focus of attention, is often by pronouns (e.g. &amp;quot;...the man...he...&amp;quot;). Indeed, in such cases, pronouns are usually preferred to expressions with more content (e.g. a repeat of the previous expression &amp;quot;...the man...the man...&amp;quot;). Since &amp;quot;the man&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the man&amp;quot; are more similar than &amp;quot;the man&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;, and hence more readily identified with one another, it is not immediately obvious why pronouns should be preferred. An answer to this question is of considerable important in understanding how people succeed in referring to people and things in a way that their hearers or readers find easy to understand.
This project investigated some ideas generated in a previous ESRC-funded project by Alan Garnham and Wind Cowles (the international collaborator on the current project). That earlier project tested one account of why pronouns are preferred to fuller expression in cases of the kind discussed above, Amit Almor's Informational Load Hypothesis (the ILH). Almor provided the first general account, within a broadly psychological framework, of how all types of referring expressions are interpreted. However, we identified several problems, both empirical and theoretical, with the ILH, and proposed a different account, which we called JANUS, because it claims that in the interpretation of referring expressions it is necessary to consider both the text that has gone before and the text that is about to come.
JANUS claims that referring expression are just as specific as they need to be of performing their functions of looking back to pick out what they refer to and looking forward to say what is about to be said in an appropriate way. On this view, unnecessary (and hence inexplicable) content in a referring expression causes the same type of problem as any other unexpected or inexplicable content. The ILH, on the other hand, proposes a more indirect mechanism, involving interference in short-term memory.
The previous project used simple behavioural measures (how long people take to read crucial parts of a text) in its investigations. However, Dr Cowles pointed out that the different accounts of JANUS and the ILH imply the use of different brain mechanisms, and that the use of these different mechanisms might be indicated by measuring so-called Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) using an established techniques for measuring EEGs (electrical activity measured on the scalp, but indicative of what is happening in the brain).
Our three experiments were based on a surprising finding originally reported by Almor and extended in our earlier project. Normally, typical instances of a category (robins as birds, apples as fruit) are more easily dealt with than atypical instances (ostriches as birds, pomegranates as fruit). What Almor showed was that when an object being talked about was strongly focused (&amp;quot;It was the pomegranite that the children squabbled over.&amp;quot;), atypical instances were easier to refer back to than typical ones. We showed that this &amp;quot;inverse typicality effect&amp;quot; was a special case of an inverse semantic distance effect and that clearer results could be obtained using three-level hierarchies (collie-dog-animal) than two-level hierarchies with typical and atypical members. So, the second sentence is (a bit) easier to process in the first of the examples below:
(a) It was the collie that chased the campers. The animal bit one of them on the leg.
(b) It was the dog that chased the campers. The animal bit one of them on the leg.
However, when the animal is not the focus of attention, the standard (non-inverted) semantic distance effect returns (second example below easier than first).
(c) What the collie chased was the campers. The animal bit one of them on the leg.
(d) What the dog chased was the campers. The animal bit one of them on the leg.
We carried out three studies because we needed a relatively large number of short texts for each ERP experiment, and the number of acceptable three level hierarchies was a limiting factor in the total number of items available. The first experiment compared focused and unfocused cases with the member of the hierarchy nearer to the most general term (dog and animal - b and d above). The second experiment compared near and distant members of the hierarchy for focused cases only (a and b above). The third experiment compared near and distant members of the hierarchy for unfocused cases only (c and d above). In each study we obtained usable data from 20-25 people, measuring electrical activity at 29 different locations on the head of each person.
Our results showed a number of interesting patterns , though they do not provide clear support for either of the theories we were examining - JANUS and the ILH. We are in the process of preparing an account of the studies for submission to an international peer-reviewed journal.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Information about what makes text coherent, and how easily people process text that is less than ideally coherent, can be used in any field in which text design is important.
