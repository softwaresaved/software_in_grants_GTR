Damage to skin through exposure to ultra violet (UV) radiation is a major societal concern and consequently there is a significant consumer demand for cosmetics formulated to block UV penetration. Materials used to block UV penetration to the skin include inorganic metal oxide particles and organic filters. Currently, organic UV-absorbing compounds are manufactured from non-renewable petrochemicals and, as a result, there is considerable commercial interest in developing organic UV-absorber compounds from renewable materials. Croda wish to develop a sustainable manufacturing process for efficient, high-level production of a natural occurring group of UV-absorbing compounds, namely Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), for use as a sunscreen additive to skin care products. Currently, the commercial production of MAAs for use in sunscreens is not a viable proposition due to the low yield and lack of fermentation technology associated with native MAA-producing organisms. This project will overcome this limitation by expressing genes encoding known MAA biosynthetic pathway enzymes in a bacterium that is widely used in industry to produce house-hold and food products and that has an excellent track record for safety.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>not required on previous TSB approved application.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research and how will they benefit? The project will benefit both Croda and Newcastle University through increased integration and collaboration across a key strategic area of activity, namely synthetic biology. The application of this technology to a defined commercially driven application will benefit academic staff through generating truly translational research. This project has the potential to provide Croda with platform technologies to exploit for the sustainable production novel metabolites or metabolites currently produced from oil-based technology.
It is expected that the inter-disciplinary nature of the project will provide a platform for new career opportunities for the appointed Research Assistants and hence the project will become a source of highly trained researchers with significant added cross-disciplinary skills (i.e. between microbiology, bioinformatics, biomedical sciences, biochemistry, fermentation and downstream processing).
 
What will be done to ensure benefits result from the Project? The results arising from the project will be used by Croda to develop a sustainable industrial process with significant commercial potential. The resulting platform technologies will also provide Croda with sustainable approaches for the development of new products or the replacement of existing products manufactured from oil-based technologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250979</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Croda International</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Croda Chemicals Europe Ltd</gtr:department><gtr:description>Croda Europe Ltd, production of mycosporine-like amino acid for use as sunscreens</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE104D30-17D0-4112-9FEA-03FDE1706414</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A potential strain of B. subtilis was generated that produced a novel MAA that was evaluated by Croda for commercial exploitation, but not taken further

The final product will be fully characterised for chemical identity, UV-absorption profile, and formulability in typical sunscreens. It is anticipated that this will present a platform capability to drive future development of alternate forms with enhanced characteristics. 

WP3: Production of MAA. Clones from two B. subtilis backgrounds were analysed by Croda for MAA production and they were able to detect new UV absorbing compounds in one of the clones. This was probably the result of the fact that the detected enzymes were the first two in the MAA pathway. Cord therefore evaluate influence of fermentation parameters on productivity and recovery of MAA.
WP4 Utility of MAA in sunscreens. The MAA product will be characterised for chemical identity and purity.has been assess for formulability in typical sunscreen formulations. However, as far as we have been made aware, the detected product is unlikely to be developed commercially
WP6: Project Management. The project was by managed by Croda.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are produced by some microbes in response to UV-irradiation. They have significant potential as additives to protect against UV-induced skin damage. The limitation to commercialisation is low yield of MAAs in the native producing organism. This project aimed seek to overcome this limitation by cloning the biosynthetic pathway into a suitable expression host. The ability of the host to produce high levels of the principal precursor metabolites is a key factor and required an evaluation of carbon flux through core metabolic pathways. 
The project was divided into a number of work packages with responsibility divided between the partners under overall management by Croda. The Newcastle Group was responsible for:
WP1: Biosynthetic pathway manipulation. MAA synthesis draws on components of core metabolism from the pentose phosphate and amino acid synthetic pathways. Strategies to optimise flux to MAA synthesis were developed using metabolic modelling in silico. The model was sufficiently robust to allow recommendations to be made concerning the growth regime that should maximise product formation. Host strains were ultimately not modified to increase flux through the MAA pathway for reasons outlined below. 
WP2: Synthetic pathway cloning into B.subtilis host the gene cluster encoding the metabolic pathway for shinerine from Anabaena variables. The gene cluster was refactored and synthesised in vitro following codon optimisation and the selection of appropriate promoter, RBS and regulatory sequences, using Synthetic Biology principle and standards. Th host wasB. subtilis, which has previously been widely used for the large-scale industrial production of metabolites. The gene cluster was successfully synthesised and cloned into an integration vector for expression in B. subtilis. North blot analysis confirmed a good level of expression of all four genes in the cluster, conditional on the addition of the inducer. However, the strains showed little or no increased resistance to UV light, as might have been expected. As a result, a proteomics analysis was carried using 2D-PAGE and this revealed that on two of the proteins encoded by the cluster were visible in the cytoplasm of the cells. It was concluded that these proteins, either through lack of an associated folding pathway, or due to innate protease sensitivity, were subject to rapid intracellular degradation. Attempts were made to use UV light resistance to find suppressor mutants were unsuccessful.
This feasibility study clearly demonstrated the limitations of Synthetic Biology in that while standardised parts and protocols can be used to generated strains, it cannot yet take into account the fact that native chassis strains such as E. coli and B. subtilis are complex organisms that have evolved sensitive and highly effective regulatory mechanism for survival in their native environments and that sometimes these regulator mechanisms (often referred to as quality control mechanisms) can work against even the most sophisticated engineered designs.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We are planning follow up proposals with Croda.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>25915CBC-226A-4762-B6D3-5D92307FE4AD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We took genes for synthesis of a natural sun tan protection molecule from a photosynthetic bacterium and engineered them for expression in an industrial bacterium, Bacillus subtilis.
