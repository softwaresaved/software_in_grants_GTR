This research project will look at the development of children's numerical skills in the preschool and primary school years. It will explore new ways of supporting early numerical development through informal number-based activities. 

Background
We know from recent research that children show individual differences in numerical skills even before they start school. These differences appear to have long lasting effects, with numerical knowledge before school predicting mathematical skills throughout primary and secondary school. As such, it is important to uncover the factors which affect children's early numerical development. 

One important factor (which has recently been discovered) is the extent to which children recognise and use numbers in informal everyday settings. Or, in other words, the extent to which children spontaneously focus on numbers. Studies have shown that preschool children show individual differences in their tendency to spontaneously focus on numbers, and these differences predict both current numerical skills and later mathematics success in school. This raises interesting questions as to whether we can support early numerical development by training children to focus on numbers in informal everyday settings. 

Research activities
The research in this project will address three questions:

1) Why does spontaneous focusing on numbers predict early numerical skills? 
2) How does formal mathematics instruction affect children's tendency to spontaneously focus on numbers?
3) Can we increase children's tendency to spontaneously focus on numbers? If so, does this lead to better mathematical outcomes?

To address these questions I will carry out three strands of research:

1) I will give children (aged 4-5 years) a range of tasks designed to measure their numerical skills and the extent to which they spontaneously focus on numbers. I will look at the strength of the relationship between these skills to uncover the reasons why children's tendency to spontaneously focus on numbers has a positive influence on numerical skills. 
2) Working with researchers across Europe I will look at the extent to which children spontaneously focus on numbers in preschools and primary schools in Northern Ireland, England, Belgium and Finland. Children in these countries all start school (and are first introduced to formal mathematics instruction) at different ages; 4, 5, 6, and 7 years, respectively. This provides a natural opportunity to uncover the effect of formal mathematics instruction on children's tendency to spontaneously focus on numbers. 
3) Working closely with preschool teachers and parents I will design informal number-based activities that encourage children to spontaneously focus on numbers. These will be simple, low-cost activities that can be easily integrated into everyday preschool routines. I will evaluate the effectiveness of these activities by measuring children's numerical skills (and the extent to which they spontaneously focus on numbers) before and after the activities have been introduced. 

Sharing findings
The project findings will further our theoretical understanding of the factors affecting children's early numerical development. They will be of interest to researchers in developmental psychology and mathematics education. I will publish findings nationally and internationally through journals, conferences and workshops. 

The findings will also have important practical applications for early years mathematics education. As such, they will be shared with those involved in children's education directly (e.g. teachers, parents) and indirectly (e.g. educational policymakers). I will produce a variety of written publications including project newsletters, education magazine articles and education policy reports. I will also organise national teacher workshops and I will develop practical resources including teacher packs, online podcasts and mobile applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal has been developed to maximise social and economic impact as well as advancing scientific knowledge. 

The focus of the research is on understanding and improving children's early numerical skills. With children as the ultimate beneficiaries, outcomes will benefit those involved in children's education both directly (e.g. early years practitioners and parents) and indirectly (e.g. educational policymakers and researchers). 

Social and Economic Impact
Understanding how numbers work is an essential life skill. It is important not only for the individual negotiating life's daily demands, but for modern society as a whole. Recent years have seen growing concerns about the numerical skills of young people worldwide. As such, there has been increased attention to early years numeracy practices, with research suggesting that early years interventions are more effective and economically efficient. 

This research will examine a novel and cost-effective approach to early years numeracy intervention. Specifically, it will provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of early years numeracy practices that foster children's informal use and recognition of numbers. The findings will be able to inform curriculum decisions within the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Framework. Recent policies within this framework have called for more formal mathematics in the preschool curriculum but we do not know whether this is the optimal approach. Crucially, this research will provide a better understanding of the role of formal and informal numerical experiences in early mathematics learning. It will allow educational policymakers to draw on a rigorous evidence base when making recommendations to government. 

Policymakers will be involved from the outset of the project through influential bodies such as the Royal Institution, the Advisory Committee of Mathematics Education (ACME), the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) and the Education Foundation. Representatives within these bodies, and also within the Department for Education, will be sent two policy-briefs (one interim and one end of project) summarising the research findings and detailing recommendations for policy. To extend links with policymakers and to ensure that these policy-briefs are of utmost relevance, a Scientific Advisory Board comprising three national experts in mathematics education will be formed and consulted with throughout the project.

Early years practitioners will also participate in the development of this research. Intervention materials will be co-developed with preschool teachers to maximise their impact in early years education practices. They will involve simple, accessible and low-cost activities that teachers and parents can readily integrate into everyday routines. Expanding on networks of local teachers (who have been closely involved with the progression of this research to date), project information, training and resources will be made widely available. A series of national teacher training workshops, online podcasts and downloadable materials (including mobile applications for children) will provide practical support for teachers, parents as well as children themselves. Importantly, a Teacher panel will be formed at the outset of the project to ensure that all of these communications and resources are timely and accessible. Furthermore, all resources will be made available on the project website (maintained both during and after the fellowship) to maximise short-term and long-term impact. 

Academic Impact
As identified in the Academic Beneficiaries section, this research will have international impact in the numerical cognition and mathematics education domains. The findings will speak to debates surrounding the role of children's early numerical experiences on later mathematics skill. They will influence theoretical models of early numerical development, as well as pedagogies for early mathematics education.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>229182</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Turku</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Finland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Grand Challenges in Mathematical Cognition</gtr:description><gtr:id>17334688-9DB8-4D91-8CA4-E9FFB81513E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A conference that took place at the Kavli Royal Society International Centre resulted in the following publication which is in press:

I have also seen impact in terms of changes in view/opinions/behaviours.

The workshop sparked questions and discussion and the students later reported that it increased their awareness of the topic area and informed their classroom practice. For example, 14 of the 16 students from the 2015/16 cohort stated that it had changed their understanding of mathematics anxiety. 

One student stated: &amp;quot;I never thought of maths anxiety as an issue before this&amp;quot;.
Another student said that &amp;quot;[maths anxiety] is more wide reaching and less determinable than I thought before&amp;quot;

Within this same cohort all 16 students reported that the information in the session was useful for informing their future classroom practice.

One student said: &amp;quot;I'll take into account factors which are affected by maths anxiety (eg. not overloading instructions).&amp;quot;
Another student reported that they would &amp;quot;choose gender-neutral examples&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;don't highlight the differences between boys and girls&amp;quot;.

Two of these students are going on to do further study (MSc/PhD) in a related field.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster presented at the 3rd Annual Math Cognition Conference, University of Missouri, St. Louis.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>134C7C19-A051-44F9-A28D-545CD3B6E723</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference Title: Typical and Atypical Development of Complex Arithmetic Skills and Higher-Order Math Concepts*
Conference Date: May 18-19, 2015
Conference Location: University of Missouri-St. Louis
Conference Attendance: Attendance at this meeting was limited to the conference speakers, poster presenters selected through a competition, and other invited researchers and guests.

I was one of twelve early career researchers to be invited to present a poster at this international conference on mathematical cognition. The conference gave me the opportunity to share my recent research findings and to expand my international links with world leading researchers in mathematical cognition. 

As a result of discussions at this conference I have been contacted by two researchers in the US who requested further information and are now using the tasks/methods I have developed to measure children's spontaneous focusing on numerosity.

I contributed to the event by giving a talk about my research and my experience of applying for postdoctoral research funding. The session was well attended and subsequent training events are now being organised as a result. The most significant outcome form my perspective were the direct requests for further information. Since the workshop I have had email exchanges with a handful of the students who attended the session. I have also been asked to contribute to similar events which occur once a semester.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Seminar (Turku, Finland)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91559B1F-00E8-49F5-B6A3-7F47A37AB329</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an invited talk at the Department of Teacher Education, University of Turku, Finland (October 2015).
