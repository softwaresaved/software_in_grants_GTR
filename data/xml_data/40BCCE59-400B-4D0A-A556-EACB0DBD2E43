The humanities have a key contribution to make to a variety of healthcare disciplines, but so far the field of medical humanities has been limited by a narrow focus on medicine and a preoccupation with literature, history and philosophy.\n\nThis project addresses a pressing need for a broader and strategically inclusive approach to applied humanities in health care. Our term Health Humanities is chosen to represent progress away from this largely medical focus, with a groundbreaking project to develop an International Health Humanities Network (IHHN) aiming to provide a platform for an evolution towards a more inclusive and impactful 'Health Humanities'. Based at the University of Nottingham, but in partnership with an expanding base of UK and international collaborators the IHHN will provide the first internationally accessible focal point for humanities and healthcare scholars to network, find shared objectives, develop resources, contribute to training, and undertake research with health and social care professionals who comprise the majority of the caring workforce, as well as informal carers, service users, self-carers, and charitable and voluntary sector.\n\nThe IHHN will spearhead the involvement of humanities disciplines in innovative health and social care practice, offering a pioneering response to the call for social relevance and impact. To begin such an exploration, four invited workshop sessions will be held that focus on the themes of health and well-being in terms of: media and film; ecology/ environment and literature; applied health linguistics; and music. These workshops will act as a starting point in expanding the way the humanities can inform and transform healthcare. The IHHN will encourage collaborative research, further funding applications, and provide a generative field for dissemination and exchange of ideas.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The health care environment is rapidly changing at both a national and global level and practitioners are seeking new ideas to help them cope with novel challenges presented by policymakers, organizational and economic changes and shifting expectations from clients and the wider public. The health humanities represent a wealth of experience, ideas and techniques for understanding illness experience, increasing empathic reach (valuable especially in transcultural care) and offering new methods for effecting desirable and cost-effective clinical, and self-help changes. Moreover, the presence of an International Health Humanities Network (IHHN)and website will be especially welcome as the division of health care into separate enclaves of different professionals, statutory, private and voluntary providers overlaid by rapid organizational change mean that electronic forums for sharing ideas, experiences and good practice, and facilitating interdisciplinary collaborative work are more vital than ever before. \n\nFor those who plan and manage health care, or develop policy, the IHHN and website will provide a source of new ideas and inspiration as well as a valuable indicator of the activities already devised and being practiced. \n\nAt present, practitioners in health and social care may be isolated from the movement to engage with the humanities. People in geographically remote areas, those in independent or private practice, practitioners in fields not presently incorporated within the statutory sector, and those within commercial provider organizations may at present have fewer opportunities to involve themselves in the health humanities movement. Therefore the IHHN and website is conceived to invite knowledge dissemination and impact, as well as sharing and participation. \n\nThe development and enhancement of the health humanities has a good deal to contribute to the delivery of health care at all levels, increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy. The proposed innovation will play a key role in making the UK's research in this field more globally significant and competitive. Researchers are increasingly keen to be able to show the value and impact of their work in an international context. Practitioners need to show they are aware of current developments in their respective fields. Consumers of health, social care and other therapeutic services are increasingly looking online to enable them to make informed choices about the interventions on offer. The proposed project makes all these outcomes more feasible, at the same time enabling a culturally richer, more empathic and interpersonally sensitive approach in health care. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30254</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Go to: http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/home/events/art-in-the-asylum-creativity-and-the-evolution-of-psychiatry.aspx</gtr:description><gtr:id>FD263CBE-06E4-4AC1-8EED-3ADBA784FCE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A major public exhibition on art and mental illness and art as a mode of recovery at Djangoly Gallery, Nottingham</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Art in the Asylum: Creativity and the evolution of psychiatry</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/home/events/art-in-the-asylum-creativity-and-the-evolution-of-psychiatry.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Reading Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>September 2010, November 2011, April 2012, May 2013, July 2013 ?

The IHHN and its website at www.healthhumanities.org was launched 13th April 2012 and has quickly developed a community of over 420 members and distribution list of over 2000 people forming a thriving global community of researchers, academics, services users, clinicians, carers and other professionals all continents. The website has quickly become a leading resource, attracting significant web traffic worldwide, particularly from the US and UK. Within its first year alone it attracted 2,199 unique visitors, 12,699 page views, with 76% of these being longer than 60 seconds. The IHHN is supported by a top class International Advisory Board of leading scholars and has incorporated impact narratives from a variety of congruent projects, a new blog, key links, presentations and/or podcasts from four AHRC-funded health humanities workshops on the themes of music, ecology, language and media/film (see below) and hosts since 2014 the informations for the new AHRC/RCUK Connected Communities large &amp;pound;1.5m research programme 'Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery for Mental Health and Well-Being', led by Professor Crawford at the University of Nottingham. 

National Seminar Series
The series of four invited UK-based seminars were held at the Institute of Mental Health and the Centre for Advanced Studies, The University of Nottingham, with talks by important scholars examining health-related aspects to ecology, music, language and film media and health. Each of these one-day seminars on average attracted 20 scholars from the subject fields, other humanities and social science disciplines, senior health service managers, clinicians and service users.

The 2nd International Health Humanities Conference: Music, Health, and Humanity was held at Montclair State University, New Jersey, on 9-11 August 2012 with major US keynote speakers (Kate Pierson of the B52s, Joel Thome) alongside other prominent UK and US academic speakers. The conference was attended by academics, service users and carers, from all over the USA, Europe (inc. Scandinavia and France), UK, South Africa, Australia and Iran. The conference generated a book of abstracts
During the conference the International Committee met and discussed running the 4th conference at Denver Colorado in 2015 and achieved early negotiations on a merger between IHHN and American Humanities Consortium so as to move the conference cycle to annual events. The theme for the next conference at Denver in 2015, hosted by the University of Colorado is entitled: 'Pop (Bio) Cultures: Politics, Practices and Privilege' and will be hosted by Professor Tess Jones, Editor of Journal of Medical Humanities. Plans for hosting the 2016 are well-advanced and this will ensure a strong legacy for this exciting and groundbreaking scholarly network and collaboration. 
Moving to an annual conference format, The 3rd IHH Conference on 'TraumaTextualities' took place on 5-7 September 2014 at The University of Nottingham with keynotes from Professors Peter Meineck (New York) and Lars Wieseth (Oslo). The conference explored trauma and texts in the context of health humanities and with a foregrounded topic of warfare. The conference included a mask performance relevant to catharsis and a visual exhibition on World War 1 trauma. The coordinators have been commissioned to provide a special issue on this them for the US-based and prestigious Journal of Medical Humanities. The 4th IHH Conference on ''Health Humanities: The Next Decade (Pedagogies, Practices, Politics)' tool place on 1-2 May, 2015 at the Center for Bioethics and Humanities, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado USA , with keynotes from Professor Sander Gilman (Emory University), Professor Brian Brown (De Montfort U, UK), Professor Alan Bleakley (Falmouth U., UK), and Kirsten Ostherr (Rice University). The 5th IHH Conference took place on 15-17 September 2016 on 'Health Humanities: Creative Practices as Care ' at The University of Seville, Spain, with keynotes from Professor Steven C. Schlozman (Harvard U), Professor Aaron Williamon (Royal College of Music), The 6th IHH Conference on 'Diversity, Cultures, and Health Humanities' will take place on 9-11 March, 2017 at McGovern Centre for Ehics &amp;amp; Humanities, Uinversity of Texas, Houston, Texas. The 7th IHH Conference is planned for Southampton University UK in 2018.

The IHHN field mission pioneered by Professor Crawford and his team has inspired the development of to date at least 35 new research units or initiatives focused on health humanities in the UK and worldwide.



Thematic Advances

This project has delivered the second, third and planned for the fourth international health humanities conference, ensuring legacy value and continued development of this new and fast-growing academic field, bringing together for the first time an unusually rich and diverse body of scholars, clinicians and mental health service users to examine and test the boundaries of how humanities disciplines might be applied in society. 
In terms of the conferences, what has been particularly striking is the broad and inclusive range of academic and non-academic speakers and attendees, marking a radical and groundbreaking evolution from the traditional medical humanities conference. 
The conference programmes have been clearly diverse with medical concerns being only a part of rather than the whole focus in terms of content and delivery. Nursing and other allied health and social care professionals joined with mental health service users, carers, social scientists and a core body of scholars in humanities disciplines. 
The theme of Health Humanities has become far more visible through www.healthhumanities.org and its sister website: www.madnessandliterature.org. Its membership reveals a global community of scholarship, information and ideas sharing in this area. The website has provided a fresh and informative resource, not least in its impact narratives to assist scholars in their work in this field, and in providing an opportunity for public access to information about particular applications of arts and humanities in terms of health benefits. Additionally, the podcasts or other materials of our eminent speakers have allowed people who were unable to attend the seminars to see the breadth of exploration undertaken. A links section enables individuals to access other resources on Health Humanities based material, and is proving to be an excellent route to collaborative project working. Indeed, the number of partners to the site is impressive and the International Board cohere rich expertise and have proved invaluable tin developing the resource.
The various discussions in the national seminars and at the sustained conferences revealed new and innovative ways of considering health humanities, in particular the value of music, ecology, language and film media. 
As the AHRC revisits its impact agenda, with increasing calls on humanities disciplines to narrate how they contribute to society, this project stands out as a model for doing just that. Indeed, the project was one of only two chosen by AHRC for its POST/RCUK event, 'The Science of Health and Wellbeing', at the House of Commons on 4 June, 2013. IHHN also features in the AHRC publication: Health and wellbeing: The Contribution of the arts and humanities (AHRC, 2013). 
The overall project has cultivated an exciting inter-animation of people and ideas from different fields of scholarship in the humanities and social sciences alongside key managers and clinicians working in health and social care as well as people who have experienced or continue to experience health challenges as service-users or carers. It has increased public access to non-positivist, interpretative and cultural consideration of health conditions and services through the lens of various arts and humanities. It has provided a legacy for engagement and social practices relevant to the field through a continuation of website-based networking and future conferences. It has demonstrated how quite different academic disciplines, healthcare organisations and the wider public can work together as stakeholders and beneficiaries of applied arts and humanities. Finally, the project has consolidated connections between US and UK researchers - and indeed to a global network in health humanities - something that AHRC strategy emphasises.

Following the success of the International Health Humanities Network, Professor Crawford led a large team to a successful application to the large grant programme of Connected Communities, achieving a &amp;pound;1.5m five year grant to investigate Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery. Professor Crawford was also invited to create and direct two new bodies at The University of Nottingham: 1. Nottingham Health Humanities (funded by the Centre for Advanced Studies), launched June 28th 2013 and already with a membership of over 75 scholars from diverse disciplines and faculties; 2. Centre for Social Futures at the Institute of Mental Health, to spearhead social and cultural research in mental health. This centre, established in December 2013 has already generated 10 Integrated Research Groups, with a team of over 50 researchers. Nottingham Health Humanities can be found at:

http://www.institutemh.org.uk/x-about-us-x/our-centres/centre-for-social-futures.

During the project period, Charley Baker was appointed as Associate Editor of Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing. Professor Crawford has been invited to advise on the formation of various health humanities centres and programmes emerging globally. With the support of the Centre for Advanced Studies (CAS) at the University of Nottingham, Crawford extended the network of health humanities scholarship with appointment of two Visiting International Fellows: Professor Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu (Stanford University) and Professor Gail Horstein (Holyoke College, US), presenting multiple talks in the university and in local NHS Trusts, and, in addition, offering research advice/ surgeries to a range of scholars. 

Professor Crawford, Professor Brian Brown, Charley Baker, Dr Victoria Tischler and Brian Abrams have written the first manifesto book for Health Humanities worldwide to be published by Palgrave London in January 2015.

During the period of the award, Professor Crawford became Director of both the Centre for Social Futures, Institute of Mental Health and Nottingham Health Humanities. He won Internal Assignment of the Year 2013 for Health Humanities in recognition of 'outstanding temporary assignment' with Unitemps. He was appointed to the Advisory Board for Social Welfare, British Library, The Cultural Value Project, Assessment Panel (AHRC), Science in Culture Advisory Committee and Assessment Panel (AHRC). He was appointed as Adjunct Professor, NTNU, Norway, to the International Advisory Board of Medical School, Arts and Humanities, University of Colorado, Denver, and as International Supervisor to Citizenship: psychosocial processes, culture and diversity, University of Seville, Department of Psychology. He was also nominated for the Eileen Skellern Lecture for his work in advancing health humanities in mental health.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4D382696-3A69-422F-B6B3-C26718064003</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>International Health Humanities Network

Working with a range of partners, including the Institute of Mental Health and the US National Institutes of Health, the International Health Humanities Network (IHHN) promotes research and collaboration in the emergent field health humanities and encourages the translation of knowledge into healthcare practice. It provides a platform for interested parties to engage in online debate and to forge collaborations between humanities scholars, healthcare practitioners and the public.



Key Activities

The IHHN and its website at www.healthhumanities.org was launched 13th April 2012 and has quickly developed a thriving global community across all continents of over 180 researchers, academics, services users, clinicians, carers and other professionals. The website remains unique in pioneering health humanities, attracting significant web traffic worldwide, particularly from the US and UK. The IHHN is supported by a top class International Advisory Board of leading scholars and has incorporated impact narratives from a variety of congruent projects, a new blog, key links, presentations and/or podcasts from four AHRC-funded invited UK-based seminars were held at the Institute of Mental Health and the Centre for Advanced Studies, The University of Nottingham, with talks by important scholars examining health-related aspects to ecology, music, language and film media and health. Each of these one-day seminars on average attracted 20 scholars from the subject fields, other humanities and social science disciplines, senior health service managers, clinicians and service users. Where permission was granted, podcasts, Powerpoints or audio files from the seminar days were made available at www.healthhumanities.org. The seminars/ workshops were as follows:

2nd International Health Humanities Conference



The 2nd International Health Humanities Conference: Music, Health, and Humanity was held at Montclair State University, New Jersey, on 9-11 August 2012 with major US keynote speakers (Kate Pierson of the B52s, Joel Thome) alongside other prominent UK and US academic speakers. The conference was attended by academics, service users and carers, from all over the USA, Europe (inc. Scandinavia and France), UK, South Africa, Australia and Iran. 



Thematic Advances



This project has delivered the second international conference on the Health Humanities, bringing together for the first time an unusually rich and diverse body of scholars, clinicians and mental health service users to examine and test the boundaries of how humanities disciplines might be applied in society. 



In terms of the conference, what was particularly striking was the broad and inclusive range of academic and non-academic speakers and attendees, marking a radical and ground-breaking evolution from the traditional medical humanities conference. 



The conference programme was clearly diverse with medical concerns being only a part of rather than the whole focus in terms of content and delivery. Nursing and other allied health and social care professionals joined with mental health service users, carers, social scientists and a core body of scholars in humanities disciplines. 



The overall project has cultivated exciting connections between people and ideas from different fields of scholarship in the humanities and social sciences alongside key managers and clinicians working in health and social care as well as people who have experienced or continue to experience health challenges as service-users or carers. It has increased public access to non-positivist, interpretative and cultural consideration of health conditions and services through the lens of various arts and humanities. It has provided a legacy for engagement and social practices relevant to the field through a continuation of website-based networking and future conferences. It has demonstrated how quite different academic disciplines, healthcare organisations and the wider public can work together as stakeholders and beneficiaries of applied arts and humanities. Finally, the project has consolidated connections between US and UK researchers - and indeed to a global network in health humanities - something that AHRC strategy emphasises.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has brought together non-academic members and contributors including senior health service managers, clinicians, service users and informal carers.



With increasing calls on arts and humanities disciplines to narrate how they contribute to society, this project stands out as a model for doing just that. Indeed, the project was one of only two chosen by AHRC for its POST/RCUK event, 'The Science of Health and Wellbeing', at the House of Commons on 4 June, 2013. IHHN also features in the AHRC publication: Health and wellbeing: The Contribution of the arts and humanities (AHRC, 2013).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>333D128B-A012-4553-8BCD-FC0D86D75601</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.healthhumanities.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C1169322-7EC8-4442-93C2-54DF481089B8"><gtr:id>C1169322-7EC8-4442-93C2-54DF481089B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Health Communication and Psychological Distress: Exploring the Language of Self-harm</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Canadian Modern Language Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/313e38e63f5344d8348e076cd96bb6f7"><gtr:id>313e38e63f5344d8348e076cd96bb6f7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harvey K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A7D7CB71-EA25-4D7F-8B84-EDB5876D357E"><gtr:id>A7D7CB71-EA25-4D7F-8B84-EDB5876D357E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Special Issue on Traumatextualities: Trauma in the clinical, arts and humanities contexts from the 3rd International Health Humanities Conference</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/caa24f1ca1e18c08c966b78d585ec7b8"><gtr:id>caa24f1ca1e18c08c966b78d585ec7b8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baker C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4D9FD3A5-B011-410C-B69A-B0C913E60C54"><gtr:id>4D9FD3A5-B011-410C-B69A-B0C913E60C54</gtr:id><gtr:title>Health humanities: the future of medical humanities?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mental Health Review Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/943ce813587923e34da1b610782df534"><gtr:id>943ce813587923e34da1b610782df534</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crawford P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/17762EAE-1B49-4A1D-AB47-1FE37DF22869"><gtr:id>17762EAE-1B49-4A1D-AB47-1FE37DF22869</gtr:id><gtr:title>Health Humanities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/943ce813587923e34da1b610782df534"><gtr:id>943ce813587923e34da1b610782df534</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crawford P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978221137282606</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BF1C5B28-C9A8-4B85-83AF-4288012932A4"><gtr:id>BF1C5B28-C9A8-4B85-83AF-4288012932A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Viewing and making art together: a multi-session art-gallery-based intervention for people with dementia and their carers</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Aging &amp;
