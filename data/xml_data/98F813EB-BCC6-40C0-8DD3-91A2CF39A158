Sharing the costs with Innovate UK would enable us to undertake this project.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>(i) Animal breeding companies, breed societies, and levy boards. A successful outcome of the project is expected to quantify the value of Precision Breeding, quantify the volume of data required to drive it, demonstrate how to implement it, and provide the tools required to implement it. Precision Breeding is expected in increase the precision, efficacy and sustainability of animal breeding. By demonstrating and enabling Precision Breeding animal breeding companies, breed societies and levy boards will be enabled to deliver a higher quality product more quickly and cheaply to their customers. AV will further benefit from being able to directly commercialise Precision Breeding rapidly.
(ii) The entire chain of users of broiler products. The entire chain of users of broiler products, including meat packers, processors, retailers and consumers by providing a higher quality product, which costs them less, and is more environmentally friendly, healthier and suited to their individual requirements.
(iii) Precision Breeding is highly applicable to plant breeders, who are increasingly adopting genomic selection. Therefore the benefits to plant breeding organisations, in the developed and developing world, will be similar to those outlined for animal breeding companies, breed societies, and levy boards. These benefits will also pertain to managers of breeding programs for companion animal populations.
(iv) UK will benefit from increased tax revenues through increased profitability of AV, the broiler supply chain, and other agricultural users should they adopt the method.
(v) The academic community. Scientifically, the project constitutes a novel approach for generating and utilizing huge volumes of sequence data. This will enable larger and hence more powerful experiments than currently feasible, which together with the analysis of the data set to be generated in this project will answer fundamental questions in to animal genetics and more broadly to the genetics of quantitative traits, which is of interest to human geneticists, plant geneticists, and evolutionary biologists. The methods developed and utilised in this project will be applicable to several fields concerned with the generation and analysis of huge volumes of data (genetics, meteorology, engineering, etc.). The size of the data generated will spawn new research into methods of analysis, which will benefit researchers in many fields. 
(vi) Commercial sequence and genotype providers. Companies providing SNP or sequence data will be able to open up a completely new market based on low cost provision of huge volumes sequence data. 
(vii) Society. All members of society who work to improve or depend upon the competitiveness and sustainability of agriculture will benefit from the downstream practical applications outlined above. The application of Precision Breeding by breeding organisations will lead to faster and more sustainable genetic progress, leading to healthier food, and food production that is more resource efficient and affordable. Increased efficiencies in agriculture has direct societal benefits in greater food security with less environmental impact.
(viii) UK science base. The proposed methods and data set will provide a platform for increased R&amp;amp;D capabilities in the UK, maintaining its scientific reputation and associated institutions, with increased capability for sustainable agricultural production.
(ix) Training. The proposed research will be embedded within training courses that the PI is regularly invited to give, and the post-docs working on the project will have the opportunity to be trained at a world-class institute in a cutting edge area of research while interacting with a leading commercial partner.
(x) Policy. Sequence data is expensive, but the research and practical benefits are potentially large. Therefore much investment will be made in sequence data in the coming years. The methods and outcomes from this project will guide this.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1237352</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Geno Global Ltd.</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Norway, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Geno Global</gtr:description><gtr:id>31A533DE-B983-4E45-807A-829D058F2102</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We expect to build on a longterm relationship with Geno, and currently we are discussing the future of this collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Geno has provided historical data form their herd and made it available to develop and train new imputation strategies.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In this partnership we will work together to develop and implement genotyping, sequencing and imputation strategies and tools in the Norwegian Red population central to Geno Global.

However, sequencing all individuals at high coverage in a large population is not feasible. Instead, we can harness the fact that individuals within a population are related and thus share sections of the genome. If we can identify and sequence individuals that share more of their genome with a large number of individuals in the population then we can pass on the generated sequence data to other individuals that share the same regions of the genome as the sequenced individual, a process known as imputation. AlphaSeqOpt is a software tool that enables researchers and breeders to define a minimal set of individuals that share more of their genomes with a large number of individuals in the population. AlphaSeqOpt also provides the sequencing investment required for a key individual in order to generate accurate and high quality sequence data that can be used to impute sequence for other individuals in the population.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6BA22C88-E5A5-491C-A67F-7B4505B099E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The AlphaSeqOpt package is freely available in AlphSuite and includes supporting manual, and access to technical support with the aim of benefiting&amp;nbsp;the academic research community in animal breeding, and expect to have the publication accepted in the near future.

Plant and animal breeding programs benefits from having a tool to evaluate the potential of different selection strategies or new emerging technologies to improve population performance. Empirical datasets to assess the effect of different factors on one population are difficult to collect, since they require substantial financial and time investments and are subject to noise and error. Simulation is a key tool for both researchers and breeders to assess the impact of different factors given a known historical and current population structure prior to implementation within a real-life setting. AlphaSim is a fast and flexible software tool that enables researchers and breeders to do this. Unlike other simulation tools, AlphaSim has the functionality to manipulate fine details of the population structure in order to simulate realistic scenarios and provides detailed outputs for use in downstream analyses.</gtr:description><gtr:id>998938E7-3556-4D6E-B8DC-A20590B2FC81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>AlphaSim is a freely available software package that simulates genetic population and can assess breeding programs.

Typical genotyping strategies involve genotyping a small number of individuals with expensive high-density marker panels, and a large number of individuals with cheaper low-density panels. Imputation is the used to infer the un-typed high-density markers in the individuals genotyped at low-density. AlphaImpute is a flexible tool that imputes genotypes and alleles accurately and quickly for datasets with large pedigrees and large numbers of genotyped markers. It combines basic rules of Mendelian inheritance, probabilistic inferences of genotypes, phasing of long stretches of haplotypes, and imputation of genotypes from a haplotype library.
