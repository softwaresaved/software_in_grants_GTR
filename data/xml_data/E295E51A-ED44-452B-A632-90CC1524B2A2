Despite this high level of interest, the artefacts themselves remain inaccessible to most researchers, because the skills required to read them are taught in only a few institutions, and because many scholars and students are unable to travel to inspect them. This project will make these resources available to the international community by providing digital facsimiles of at least twenty manuscripts from seven libraries. The manuscripts have been chosen both for their intrinsic interest and their typicality; they span the period ca. 1450-1750 and cover topics from heraldry and law, to English and Latin poetry, theology, and medicine. In addition, this project will tap concentrated local expertise to offer online teaching and research resource, enabling researchers to learn and apply the key skills of palaeography and manuscript (description. The project will include three annual symposia on textual studies and intellectual culture in the late medieval and early modem periods. These will result in a book of essays from leading experts in the field. Scriptorium will thus enable a wider pubic to make use of manuscript materials, enhancing historical, genealogical, and literary research worldwide. Scriptorium consists of three parts: 
 Locus: a digital archive of medieval and early modem manuscript facsimiles; 
 English Handwriting: a course of interactive teaching /reference resources in medieval and early modem palaeography, including a searchable database of abbreviations; 
 Manuscript Studies Resources: a set of resources on the conventions for describing late medieval and early modem manuscript, alongside searchable image databases of manuscript provenance images, and binding. 
These three components draw intensively on our core group of twenty late medieval and early modern manuscripts, as well as on a wider range of holdings at our participating libraries and archives - all of them practically inaccessible to most users. 
Scholars and students of early modem culture now pursue much of their research on early printed materials via online facsimiles. This revolution has so far had little impact on manuscript studies. While some research libraries are beginning to embrace digitisation as a means to preserve and disseminate their manuscript holdings, conservation and funding priorities, rather than scholarly values, have so far tended to drive the process. Bringing our selected manuscript materials into wider circulation - both by publishing facsimile editions, and by furnishing a wide community with the skills to read them - will broaden the user-base of these resources and further our understanding of manuscript culture at a critical time of electronic expansion. 

The development of this project, in consultation with Librarians, palaeographers and experts on manuscript culture, educational technologist, and digital librarians, has led to a robust and realisable scheme of work and production. Once funding is secured, we will formally appoint an external Advisory Board to continue to monitor our design and development We have had valuable feedback on our first ARHC application (2004, rated A*), and on our pilot teaching tool, English Handwriting 1500-1700: An Outline Course, both from users and via a2003 seminar at the Institute of English Studies at the University of London. We have benefited from the recent work of local colleagues on the HEFCE-funded Medieval Imaginations and AHRB-funded Cambridge Illuminations project, and have established a continuing dialogue with colleagues working on rare materials in the digital environment</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>410021</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D502985/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>470B20F0-5FD1-4AA6-8809-5E2780CBDB18</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
