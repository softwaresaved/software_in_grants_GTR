It aims to strengthen China's multiple maker communities in partnership with the UK, as part of broader support for China's creative industries and knowledge economy.

The project results from the British Council/AHRC's Living Research: Making in China initiative, in which a group of UK academics and makers were immersed in China's maker culture in October 2015. Initial findings and discussion identified key themes and approaches to develop to further contribute to Living Research's aims.

China's Creative Communities take place amidst a growing, but differentiated, emphasis on making in China and the UK. The UK's first makerspace opened in the 1990s, while China's first makerspace only opened in 2010. Now China has a rapidly expanding maker movement set to only grow following Premier Li Keqiang's first visit to a makerspace in Shenzhen in 2015 and the subsequent publication of the Report on the Work of the Government, which identified 'makers coming thick and fast' as part of its growing creative industries.

As in the UK, China's makerspaces vary widely, from self-funded hacker workshops to sites of middle-class leisure. Chinese policy and private investment focus on makerspaces as accelerators and incubators for product innovation. This is most evident in Shenzhen, China's electronics manufacturing capital, whose readily available manufacturers, materials and componentry has attracted a global community of makers looking to benefit from a production ecosystem largely absent in Europe and the USA. The technology-based innovation focus on makerspaces should be understood amidst economic uncertainty in China over its mass manufacturing future. A concomitant threat to China's status as the world's largest producer and economic emphasis on makerspaces tallies with Made in China 2025, the initiative to move its economy up the value chain to focus on design, quality, innovation and sustainability. These are areas of UK expertise potentially valuable in China: the UK has a strong, ever-more socially and sustainably responsible, design culture, and its maker movement is seen as potentially able to encourage a similar ethos.
 
Despite the excitement and potential for China's makerspaces, their future is uncertain, with some lacking strong community presence. Yet China also has a strong design and making culture, in other, less supported communities currently seen as external to its maker movement: urban villages; traditional crafts, and shanzhai. Matching China and UK researchers and makers to investigate makerspaces as part of this broader making ecology could offer ways to maximise the social, cultural and economic benefits, and extended values, of making in China. 

Overall, this project aims to provide forums for making-based knowledge exchange in the UK and China through which the diverse values of making in China can be explored and enhanced. It will consolidate connections and build new networks between China and UK's making-related communities and extend the types of values and communities associated with making. We will also use this project to test methods and approaches and identify research questions that will create a foundation for future projects to benefit making communities in China and the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This cross-disciplinary scoping research project brings together practitioners, academics and entrepreneurs in the UK and China to network, workshop and publically disseminate ideas and innovations around the multi-faceted value of making in China. It aims to strengthen China's multiple maker communities in partnership with the UK, amidst broader support for its creative industries and growing knowledge economy. 

The planned research activities will engender a significant degree of knowledge exchange between UK and China participants with the intention that both parties benefit from the research outcomes. As a primarily scoping and networking project, these outcomes will focus on identifying targeted questions and areas for future larger-scale research projects, building relationships and opening up maker networks to identify appropriate partners to participate in these future projects. 

The activities are also intended to have value in their own right: the tours, workshops and discussions will inform a broader understanding of making and making culture and therefore will provide insights and practical lessons that can be of direct benefit to the Chinese and UK participants. Specifically, these activities will focus on areas of UK expertise new and beneficial to China's making culture: the role of makerspaces in place making and community building, nurturing entrepreneurship and innovation; critically engaged making, the value of sustainably driven design and making, including ideas of the circular economy and increasing product longevity, and the integration of material knowledge and sensitivity with digital capabilities. 

The non-academic participants from China, David Li and Lit Liao are both intimately connected with the maker cultures in Shenzhen, Shanghai and beyond (for example Li is co-founder of Xin Che Jian and Maker Collider in Shanghai). Through their significant networks and connections they can contribute to and disseminate knowledge gained through their participation in stages 3 and 4 to a broad spectrum of China and UK based organisations, makers, entrepreneurs and businesses. This is specifically in the case of Li, who has informed China's strategic development in this area and Lit Liao, who is seen as a figurehead amongst China's minority of female makers. Therefore the outcomes of this research have the potential to impact at a strategic and social level in China. 

At a more grassroots level the workshops and salon events in China will be attended by a range of invited participants, including those from design and small batch manufacturing companies, the craft sector, incubator/accelerator organisations and cultural organisations (such as V&amp;amp;A Shekou), as well as the public, thereby potentially reaching a broad range of makers and other interested parties who should benefit from participating in critical activities and debates that provide new UK-led approaches and perspectives on making and making culture outlined above.

There will be similar benefits and routes to impact for the UK non-academic participants and consultants directly involved in the salons, workshops and tours in the UK. They will benefit from the networking opportunities this provides both with the Chinese visitors and the other UK participants, and through the organisations they represent outcomes will be disseminated across their networks. Furthermore the public facing events in the UK will provide a mechanism for the wider public to engage in the research discussions, again with a number of invited participants from a range of sectors and organsations.

There will be a mutual benefit to both UK and Chinese individual participants and organisations in building new and existing relationships that could form the basis for future collaborative projects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50703</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote conference speakers (Shenzhen)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51F0729A-1A5B-414A-925F-F8F4A77D0EE0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by the Institute for Cultural Industries Shenzhen University in November 2016 to be a keynote speaker at &amp;quot;The Convergence of Culture and Technology and Establishment of Innovation Eco-system&amp;quot;, a symposium organised on 12 and 13 November by the Institute for Cultural Industries at Shenzhen University.

From the perspective of June 2016 it is too early be able to identify significant impact. We will be alert to possible impacts, particularly in relation to the values promoted by the project (creativity, community/agency, sustainability and entrepreneurialism), and the organisation of events that have resulted in response to the project's aims and activities. There have already been identifiable extra-academic impacts on a small scale:

new membership of China's maker communities:
Several of the workshops we organised saw individuals enter makerspaces for the first time. These individuals, primarily female, have now become part of Wechat groups focused on Shenzhen's maker community, and a possible Fixperts initiative.

new knowledge / activities
Marshall's conductive ink printing workshop has already been voluntarily repeated at Litchee Lab by Lit for the local community

new relationships and partnerships
Other academic routes include Chinese researchers taking forward the research and building on their own projects and publications. Wen Wen, a researcher in the Institute for Cultural Industries at Shenzhen University, participated in several of the stage 3 events and has contributed a post to the blog. Our project aligns with her own research interests in China's creative communities, and I anticipate further published research in this area. We also developed relationships with Tsinghua University and NYU Shanghai, which we anticipate leading to further individual and collaborative research activity
research networks, exchanges, residencies and visits.
 
New contacts, relationships and partnerships have been established through the project. These include connecting Liao with designers and design studios involved in UK maker education.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A288145C-31A2-40B2-8FBB-410CB62B45B9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The principal aim of this project was to bring together individuals and organisations in the UK and China to participate in a networking, researching and scoping project in order to strengthen China's maker communities in partnership with the UK. Research objectives included:
- Test methods of international engagement, networking and dissemination
- Understand the condition of China's maker community in broader creative, industrial, social, cultural, political economic contexts
- Develop and build new relationships
- Identify other knowledge and expertise required to meaningfully support China's maker communities

1 - Methodology
We developed a methodology initiated in Living Research: Making in China, an earlier AHRC/British Council research visit to China in October 2015 that involved several China's Creative Communities researchers. This methodology brought together academics, practitioners and industry figures in practice-based, immersive research. We developed this cross-disciplinary approach in China's Creative Communities through organising and participating in several activities: informal interviews, visits, public discussion salons and creative and practical workshops.

We found the inclusive nature of these overwhelmingly primary and empirical research methods appropriate and valuable. They enabled makers, makerspace users and others in Shenzhen's creative community to have their own voice. The digital craft workshops in China and London enabled participants to experience the possibilities of craft-led innovation and bringing together traditional and newer technologies while also providing informal environments conducive to open discussion.

2 - New Knowledge and Research Questions
These included identifying uncertainty over the future of the maker movement in Shenzhen amongst the local community, attributed to factors including over-inflated government-backed expansion leading to unsustainable economic models for makerspaces and empty makerspaces. This has contributed to several new developments: an increasing recognition of the community value of makerspaces (as opposed to the heavy focus on entrepreneurism and innovation); the embrace of design culture and recognition of its importance for China's creative industries; an allied growing interest in craft; the rise of maker education in schools; interest in the potential economic and innovation value of makerspaces; a growing interest in sustainability.

The research has led to new questions including: how can China's design, craft and maker communities be strengthened through collaboration, both within and beyond China; what role can education play in China's maker communities; how can China and the UK establish meaningful relationships to benefit creative industries, maker culture and SME manufacturing in both countries?

3 - Networks, Collaborations and Partnerships
Through this project we strengthened partnerships with the two China-based participants, David Li, China's leading maker movement spokesperson and Lit Liao, founder of lively Shenzhen makerspace Litchee Lab. Through visits, workshops and networking we also introduced making networks and initiatives new to China, such as Fixperts and the Maker Library Network. We also established new connections between UK, Chinese and international maker communities, including key figures and organisations in maker education and enterprise (e.g. Makerversity, Machine Rooms, MadLab), the creative industries (e.g. Bare Conductive, Technology Will Save Us), and the FabCity movement. A full list of visits and activities are on the project blog 
https://chinascreativecommunities.wordpress.com. New opportunities and partnerships are being developed through email and Wechat.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The outcomes of the research will taken forward through:
 Our China's Creative Communities website https://chinascreativecommunities.wordpress.com/ which provides an extensive and publically accessible resource of useful information and reflections for those wishing to engage with Shenzhen's maker and broader design and manufacturing sectors.
 
A forthcoming peer-reviewed article in Digital Culture journal authored by Marshall and Rossi focusing on the multi-method research approach used. This will be of value to researchers interested in novel methods for gaining insights to complex situations. Further more substantial academic outcomes may follow.
 
Joining and instigating appropriate Wechat groups. This provides the researchers and others interested, in both UK and China, forums to discuss, share ideas, collect feedback and network.

The planned introduction of Fixperts and Maker Library Network to China. This will allow China's makers and makerspaces to become part of international networks focusing on their social/community and educational roles and will have substantial reciprocal benefits to both the UK and China communities.
 
The visits and activities that David Li and Lit Liao were involved in there was recognition of the cultural and economic benefits of further activities. Proposals included: extended visits by a broader representative selection of making ecosystem, from makers and designers to manufacturers; residencies and exchanges in UK and Chinese makerspaces. These will be pursued in the near future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>763A5357-9F14-411B-8B53-08054A4B26BB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://chinascreativecommunities.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in shaping funding call and participation in judging panel for AHRC / British Council &amp;quot;Hello Shenzhen: Researching the Ethics of Makerspaces&amp;quot;.
