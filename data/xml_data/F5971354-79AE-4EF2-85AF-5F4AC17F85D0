This project is both timely and important because of the increasing numbers of bacteria acquiring resistance to existing antibiotics. Our research compares the way three outpatient lung infection clinics attempt to control AMR and cross-infection through the design, practices and architectural layout of their built environments. It further seeks to learn lessons from this to limit AMR in wider healthcare settings. 

The PARC project has been co-designed in close collaboration with our three partner cystic fibrosis (CF) clinics. CF is just one of many life-threatening conditions characterised by long-term antibiotic treatment giving rise to cross-infection. In turn, cross-infection leads to clusters of highly resistant bacteria which significantly reduce life expectancy and now threaten to reverse recent improvements in survival. 

Dialogue with our clinical partners highlights the very different material and design approaches taken to prevent cross-infection through physical isolation, segregation and containment. Despite these variations, detailed research into questions of design and practice within the built environment of respiratory clinics is sparse. This research will be significant because CF clinics have much to learn by reflecting on their own practices. They also have much to learn from each other, and much to offer the wider clinical community in limiting AMR. Our focus on CF as an exemplar has far broader relevance in design approaches to AMR mitigation in more common respiratory disorders and in infection control more generally. 

This research will make visible the different and sometimes competing AMR design priorities of key stakeholders (including people with CF, clinicians, designers, hygiene personnel, etc.). It will map the differing 'real world' pathways and journeys through each clinic. It will explore how physical interaction, contact and exchanges are managed through the layout of the clinics. It will also enable our partner clinics and their users to explore scope for redesigning practice and repurposing clinical space to limit AMR and cross-infection. 

Our project involves an innovative combination of visual and qualitative research methods. We will be using the architectural layout plans of each clinic as a focus for interviews with patients, clinicians, hospital estates personnel, hygiene staff and designers. Our interviews will also draw on the skills of the project's graphic artist who specialises in fieldwork illustration to visually record real world experiences and journeys. We will also be undertaking 'walking interviews' placing our respondents within the flow of their routines, and using photography to chronicle risky spaces and objects. The project has an observational component to document key sites of high risk within the clinics including waiting areas, reception desks, corridors, wash basins and hand sanitisers, etc. These visual, graphic and textual findings will subsequently be used in co-design workshops at each of the clinics to improve present and future AMR mitigation. 

The project brings together the expertise of a highly multidisciplinary team involving an academic architect, sociologists of medicine and science, micro-biologists and a graphic artist. PARC will have a positive impact upon: our three partner clinics who have been involved in the design of the project; people with CF and the CF Trust; the wider respiratory healthcare community, the NHS and Department of Health; healthcare designers and architects; policy making on AMR.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>PARC is designed to have a direct benefit for our partner clinics in addition to broader influence in healthcare.
1. CF Clinics (Project Partners): The Leeds, Liverpool and York clinics have been closely involved in PARC's study design to ensure findings shape future practice. The project will have impact through the active collaboration of the clinics within each of the 3 Work Packages and the drafting of 3 interim reports. Complete reports including a confidential annex (2 pages) will be discussed at each of the clinics and formulated to feed directly into their Health Care Associated Infection Reduction Plans. Portable Project Poster Presentations will present core findings and visual data (Chapman's interview illustrations, layout plans, etc.) providing a focus for redesign options in WP 3 at each clinics, and subsequent impact and dissemination (see below). Interim reports: 'Spaces and Practices - mitigating anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in the outpatient clinic' (month 12); 'Pathways, Journeys and Flow - mitigating anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in the outpatient clinic' (month 18); 'Imagining Redesign - mitigating anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in the outpatient clinic' (month 21). 
2. Respiratory healthcare and infection control stakeholders: CF as an exemplar has broader relevance in design approaches to AMR-mitigation for more common respiratory disorders. Respiratory clinics face multiple design challenges exacerbated by existing floor plans, entrenched practices, the age of buildings, and communication barriers between designers and end users. By defining and sharing creative design ideas, CF clinics have much to learn from each other, and much to offer the wider clinical community in limiting AMR. In order to achieve wider impact we will register for presentations at clinical conferences including the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and the Federation of Infection Societies Conference (FISC). The Cystic Fibrosis Trust has agreed that we present at their Annual Conference in addition to other events (see letter of support from CF Trust). We will present the project's aims and findings to clinical workshops at our partner CF clinics and create opportunities to present to other CF/Respiratory clinics nationally. 
3. Healthcare architectural design stakeholders: The project is designed to have impact within the healthcare architectural community who are increasingly tasked with taking infection control into account. Impact will be achieved through networking and dissemination to bodies such as, for example, Architects for Health (AfH) and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Our Project Advisory Group includes the senior architect for P+HS Architects Limited and the lead designer of Nottingham's Wolfson Cystic Fibrosis Centre. 
4. Project Advisory Group: the PAG will serve as a means of embedding impact into the project, providing input into the production of dissemination activities, and extending PARC's influence (See Pathways to Impact)
5. The Stakeholders' Forum will take place at the end of the project comprising round-table workshops generating feedback and input into key findings, highlighting aspects of innovative AMR-mitigation design transferable to broader settings (n40 participants). 
6. Planned Non-academic publications: The team routinely publish and contribute to non-academic audiences (see Pathways to Impact).
7. Additional funding for impact and follow-on research: A number of strategies are in place to ensure new and added value of PARC. We will apply to UoY's &amp;pound;5m WT funded Centre for Future Health (2017-2022) for KIT (Knowledge Exchange, Impact and Translation). PARC has been designed to pump-prime further interdisciplinary research on AMR in the wider built environment by collaborating with our microbiology and clinical partners.
