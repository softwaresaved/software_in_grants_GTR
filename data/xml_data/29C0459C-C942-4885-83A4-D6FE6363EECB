Tawney, Viviana Zelizer and many other theorists besides. While acknowledging and in many respects speaking to the path-breaking work of such influential thinkers and scholars, this project is also about the relationship between religious practice and economic thought. It is predicated on the little-appreciated premise that the primary economic exchange in a religious setting is not and has never been an intellectual one, but rather, has always been a physical one. In other words, the project suggests that the process of church fundraising was (and is) in itself a significant economic phenomenon, worthy of examination and conceptualisation in its own right, and that it has the potential to tell us a great deal about the interaction of religion and economics in the lives of ordinary people. 

This research therefore takes the form of an extended historical case study of the Irish Catholic Church's finances during what was a key period of consolidation in its influence over the Irish population, namely between 1850, considered by some the beginning of a 'devotional revolution' among the Irish, and 1921, when it ceased to be a minority church within the United Kingdom, and instead became the dominant church in a newly independent country. The project will incorporate a unique database of income constructed from multiple church and other archives, a systematic overview of the kinds of income-gathering strategies employed, a typology of motives for contributing funds, and a consideration of the modern-day applicability of the project's findings.

Though primarily a historical project, it is, like much recent research in economic anthropology and economic sociology, thinking about and hoping to provide insights into individual economic behaviour in ways that mainstream economics, with its focus on rational actor models, has tended to neglect. (Graeber, 2011; Stirrat, 2006; Zelizer, 2013; Dodd, 2014) Thus, while some sociologists of American religion have begun to consider the motivations behind and consequences of religious fundraising, (Peifer 2010; Mundey et al, 2011) there are irresistible reasons for historicising these questions, and for doing so in the Irish Catholic context. These include the relatively much larger sums of money involved in a much more devout period; the useful and virtually unmatched transnational comparison afforded by the existence of multiple 'Irish' parishes in countries outside Ireland and of Irish clerical appeals directed at attracting religious remittances from the diaspora; the parallel nexus of supposed secularisation/modernisation and an increasingly monetised and rising consumer society; and the acknowledged symbolic significance of the Irish Catholic Church's wealth and central importance of Catholicism to emerging Irish identity. Crucially for the successful completion of the project, there also exists a multiplicity of accessible and underexploited source materials, in archives in both Ireland and Britain and in digital repositories, with which to explore these themes.

Therefore, this project will represent a contribution to the history of religion and the Irish Catholic Church in particular, exploring that dominant institution's local, national, and transnational power and influence in the economic realm, and asking to what extent it helped to shape an Irish economic identity both in Ireland and amongst the Irish abroad.

But it is also intended to serve as a timely addition to the literature on the history of money and economic behaviour more generally, by offering a comprehensive exploration of one nation's religiously-motivated fundraising and asking fundamental questions about the interaction of religion and economics in people's lives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although it is envisaged that the chief beneficiaries of this research will initially be a broad academic community, the research addresses the concerns of a number of organisations and communities beyond academia and is likely to be of relevance and significant benefit to them. The key non-academic beneficiaries are: churches and local religious organisations in Ireland and the UK; fundraisers working with and for these churches and religious organisations; voluntary social services and their users.

While the project is asking fundamental questions about ordinary people's economic behaviour, it is certainly borne in mind that the specific phenomenon in focus - religious fundraising - is an on-going and important one. Indeed, it is notable that, in a recent survey of small Irish charities, 17.6% of 500+ organisations reported using church gate collections regularly as a fundraising technique (Kelleher &amp;amp; Millar, 2013). Clearly, churches and other religious organisations, many with significant, cognate humanitarian or social roles (e.g. food banks, debt advice clinics, homeless shelters), still largely rely on voluntary financial contributions to function today. They do so in a context where congregations, and hence revenues, are in decline, and it is becoming more difficult to provide the full gamut of services that parishioners - whether attending or non-attending - both expect and require from their local churches. Thus, evidence-based research that examines why different categories of people have historically given money to churches (and, indeed, why some have not) and how churches have gone about asking them for money, as this project will provide, is likely to be of considerable interest and value to such organisations in the twenty-first century. 

In particular, if western society is, as sociological research tends to confirm, increasingly secularised, then any indication and explication of reasons for giving money to religious causes that do not have underlying them a specific religious-faith rationale are potentially very useful to contemporary church fundraisers, who have a recognised need to reach out to individuals beyond their faithful membership for financial contributions. While much contemporary fundraising research carried out in business schools, for example, focuses on how national and transnational charities can capture the patronage of high net worth donors or on otherwise improving fundraising techniques and strategies for larger-scale humanitarian organisations, this neglects what is, in aggregate, a very significant local nexus. 

It is anticipated, therefore, that this project's outputs can be used in a targeted manner to help play a part in promoting evidence-based innovation in fundraising among local religious organisations, and thereby help to increase revenues in support of vital voluntary social services in local communities in both the UK and Ireland. This is, in turn, likely to bring about measurable benefits to those communities in terms of improved health, well-being and social welfare.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196403</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk to Catholic Historical Society, St. Patrick's College, Dublin</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5D1DE577-67D2-4738-8997-E0B0607FE748</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk to annual event of the Catholic Historical Society, attended by academics, students, general public and clergy/bishops.
