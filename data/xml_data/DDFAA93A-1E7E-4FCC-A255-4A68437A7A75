The ability to act in a planned and purposeful way to achieve our goals is vital in everyday life, and is thought to rely particularly on the frontal lobes of the brain. This idea has significant implications: The frontal lobes are the part of the brain that is slowest to develop as we pass through childhood and adolescence, fastest to decline as we age, and is among the most affected regions by psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and depression. All of these groups struggle to some degree in situations requiring cognitive control: learning new skills, coping with many simultaneous demands on attention ('multi-tasking'), and ignoring distractions. Understanding the psychology of cognitive control and the neuroscience of the frontal lobes therefore promises to have important implications for education, treatment in psychiatry, and understanding the challenges of an aging population. Our research specifically investigates how people predict and learn from the consequences of their actions. To do this, we study how people perform carefully designed cognitive laboratory tasks, and in some experiments measure their brain activity as they do so, to answer the following questions: 1) Does focusing on the desired outcome of a task help us to perform the task better? Our hypothesis is that people should be better able to ignore distractions when the goal of their task is clear and understandable. Using neuroimaging, we expect to see brain activity relating to task goals even before those goals are reached, and from this activity we should be able to predict how well people will perform a task. 2) How do positive outcomes, such as financial rewards, help us to learn? We are testing the idea that, when rewards are earned, this reactivates brain regions that were involved in performing the task that led to the reward, strengthening their involvement and therefore improving task performance in future. By answering these questions, our research should help us to understand a central feature of human behaviour: our ability to direct our thoughts and activities toward achieving our goals. Our findings will not only increase scientific understanding of this basic human trait, but should also lead to new ideas about how to improve practice in the classroom, clinic, and beyond. For example, recent research has shown that focused training in cognitive control tasks can result in improvements in educational outcomes in schoolchildren, and can reduce some of the cognitive difficulties experienced by patients with schizophrenia. Better understanding of the brain systems responsible for cognitive control, and improved methods for measuring these abilities, should in the future lead to improvements in these applications of scientific research on cognitive control and the functions of the frontal lobes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The proposed project investigates the role of action outcomes--rewards and sensory action effects--in the control of behaviour, exploring novel territory at the intersection of research on human cognitive control, instrumental action selection, and reinforcement learning. These literatures each focus on goal-driven behaviour, but differences in their theoretical and methodological approaches have limited cross-stimulation to date. As a consequence, little is currently known about (A) cognitive control of instrumental tasks in which actions are directed towards achieving particular outcomes and, conversely, about (B) the role of reinforcement in learning high-level task representations. The proposed research investigates these issues in two series of studies that extend behavioural, EEG and fMRI approaches used successfully in our prior work in these separate fields. Series A evaluates the hypothesis that anticipation of task outcomes--specifically, the sensory consequences of actions--contributes to effective online control of behaviour. Our approach contrasts with the traditional focus of cognitive control research on tasks in which the goal is defined in terms of the response required rather than the effect that the response yields in the environment. Series B evaluates the hypothesis that reinforcement drives learning by feeding back a teaching signal to reactivate areas that successfully fulfilled the task at hand. Extending previous research, we focus specifically on reactivation of high-level task representations. Both series use novel paradigms that incorporate meaningful outcomes into competing cognitive tasks. Using tasks with dissociable neural correlates, neuroimaging methods can be used to probe the modulation of task-selective cortical regions according to anticipated and experienced action outcomes. Together these studies will reveal the pivotal role of action outcomes in the online control of human action and in the acquisition of complex behaviours.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary goal of this project is to advance scientific theory and practice in the study of human voluntary action and cognitive control. The underlying neurocognitive mechanisms of goal-directed behaviour and learning are crucial to most higher-level mental faculties. Our findings therefore promise to have significant implications for measuring, understanding, and improving human learning and behaviour in a variety of basic science and applied contexts. Our ongoing collaborations and local collaborative opportunities provide specific pathways to impact for the proposed work. 1. Improving predictive cognitive markers throughout the lifespan Lab measures of cognitive control such as inhibition and working memory are predictive of educational success in childhood and of cognitive decline in ageing. Deepening our scientific understanding of underlying mechanisms will lead to more powerful tools for identifying key cognitive factors and targeting appropriate interventions. In particular, the central thesis of the present proposal is that existing approaches overlook a crucial factor in cognitive control: the nature of the goals to which our actions are directed. If confirmed, this idea would imply that current methods could be improved to more accurately probe cognitive control as it contributes to educational outcomes and quality of life in ageing. The Oxford Depts of Experimental Psychology and Education provide collaborative opportunities to develop this pathway to impact on evidence-based policy making through education and ageing research. 2. Probing decision making in gambling Studies of the mechanisms of reward and learning have contributed substantially to understanding pathological decision making in addiction and gambling. Our proposal provides valuable extensions of this research to investigate higher-level control of behaviour that begin to bridge between simplified lab paradigms and the complexity of real-world cognition and behaviour. Yeung's collaborative research investigating decision making and learning in gamblers provides a pathway for translating findings from the proposed research into more applied research with implications for improving wellbeing and quality of life. 3. Identifying cognitive markers for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) BCI devices are finding increasing use in medical, military, and commercial settings. Neural markers of cognitive control and learning are particularly relevant to 'augmented cognition' devices that use real-time neuroimaging to optimise human performance. Yeung has an established industry collaboration on BCI development; for example, using neuroimaging markers of cognitive load in a BCI device that modulates the rate of information flow to intelligence analysts searching satellite imagery. This example illustrates the opportunities for commercialising our scientific findings to attract R&amp;amp;D investment from private sector business and industry for cutting edge technologies. 4. Increasing international collaboration The project would establish a new British-French collaboration, complementing and extending the PIs' existing collaborations with researchers in the UK, US, Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands towards developing a strong international research network in this field. 5. Increasing public understanding A primary aim of the project is to forge stronger links between behaviours studied in the psychology lab and behaviour in the real world, extending lab paradigms to incorporate the crucial feature of everyday actions that they are fundamentally directed towards achieving identifiable outcomes. As such, the project offers valuable opportunities to increase public understanding of science in this field via presentations of the work to non-academic audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>332711</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Paris - Descartes</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Florian Waszak - Paris Descartes</gtr:description><gtr:id>18C83F97-9ACD-4C30-8F1D-F52793654BD2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outcomes of the project are listed elsewhere, e.g., publications, organisation of the interdisciplinary workshop at Oxford.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>In collaboration with Prof Yeung, Dr Waszak made equal contributions to the design, analysis and dissemination of the research conducted.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The funded project established a new collaboration between Prof Nick Yeung at Oxford and Dr Florian Waszak at Paris Descartes University.

As outlined in the original proposal, we organised a 2-day workshop that brought together a group of speakers whose research interests provide pathways to impact for our project -- researchers working on relevant animal models and computational approaches, and on applications of cognitive control research in social, educational and clinical settings. The speakers came from around the UK, as well as internationally from Australia, France, and the Netherlands. The event was attended by over 100 delegates, primarily academic researchers but also including representation from medical institutions and funding agencies (ESRC). Delegates were mostly UK-based, but included visitors from 7 other European countries. Complementing the high-profile speakers, poster sessions facilitated provided opportunities for graduate and postdoc-level attendees (as well as some senior academics) to present their research facilitate cross-fertilisation of ideas.

Delegate feedback on the symposium content included: &amp;quot;Excellent, wide coverage yet highly relevant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The workshop comprised of an eclectic mix of academics covering a diverse range of disciplines. It was clear that the organisers sought to reach out beyond the immediate audience for the research and in doing so consider the relevance of the project for partners operating in different disciplines.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I thought it was an excellent selection of talks, all very good and from many different but converging angles. It happened a few times that questions I wanted to ask after one talk made the main topic of one of the next talks, so the whole workshop gave a very rounded view of the field. The posters, too, were great quality, coming from varied perspectives, informative and thought-provoking.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;good mix of experimental techniques, translation and some modelling&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The organisers managed to successfully strike a delicate balance of exactly enough overlap in terms of research topics / interests to result in very fruitful cross-pollination and exchange of ideas&amp;quot; &amp;quot;was very interdisciplinary. I heard excellent talks from experimental psychology, neuroscience, as well as computational modelling. As such the workshop helped me form a much more integrated model of outcome prediction processes than i had before. Moreover, in the excellent poster sessions, I was able to talk to some of these researchers, and was able to link my own questions to theirs&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the workshop nicely showcased recent trends towards these lines of work coming together&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The mix of researchers working on really quite different topics within the broad framework of outcome prediction (with behavioural, neural and social backgrounds) was what made the meeting work so well&amp;quot;

Delegate feedback on specific impacts for them included: &amp;quot;Great! I met many people, learned a lot and received useful feedbacks about my research&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Attending the workshop enabled me to consider wider implications of outcome prediction research for a range of fields in both a theoretical and applied sense&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Very useful in terms of seeing the questions people are asking right now&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It gave me more recent information about the field and helped me shape some of my research questions better. It was very good value for time&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It was useful - new leads to follow...&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The poster session was a great opportunity to get feedback on my ongoing research, which is right at the intersection of cognitive control and reinforcement learning, and gave me lots of ideas for&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It provided a very useful index of the state of research in the field. I expect it is likely to inspire further experiments in our laboratory&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The conference was incredibly useful to me. I learned about various different approaches in the talks, and was able to link up with researchers in the poster session. I had many excellent discussions in the poster session, and was pointed to important papers that resolved some of the puzzles i came across in my research. I really enjoyed the conference. It was really well organised, with lots of opportunity for interaction.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;My ongoing and future work is directly exactly at this interface between cognitive control in the classic sense and value-based decision making, so I greatly benefited from all the talks which each helped me understand yet another piece of the complex puzzle&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Workshop covered several areas of cognitive sciences that are relevant for my PhD, it was really insightful&amp;quot; &amp;quot;As I presented a poster to people working on different topics with different methods and points of view, I received a lot of interesting feedback. Therefore, the workshop was very useful&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The meeting was very useful to me, largely because of its interdisciplinary nature. The topic of outcome prediction is so broad that a meeting like this is invaluable for bringing together researchers with diverse backgrounds (who would normally attend different conferences) but a common aim. It was great to have the chance to make contact with these people. In more concrete terms, I also received some useful suggestions regarding diections to take my own research in this area.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1343961</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Strengthening Human Adaptive Reasoning and Problem Solving</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F0C52136-72B6-449B-92CB-DC4DB5DEFC99</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The primary goal of the grant-funded research is to advance scientific theory and practice in the study of human learning, voluntary action and cognitive control. Findings from the project have been published in two academic papers to date-an integrative review paper in the Journal of Physiology-Paris that sets out the theoretical basis for the research, and an empirical study of reward-related reactivation of sensory cortex published in the prestigious Journal of Neuroscience. Two further papers are currently in the peer review process. We anticipate at least one further high-profile publication to follow these. The published papers are already influencing ongoing research as evident in citations and invitations to present the research findings around the UK and overseas. The research was showcased at the workshop organised as part of the project, which established common ground between researchers in disparate fields that our research aimed to link. Feedback from workshop delegates (see Engagement Activities and Influence on Policy, Practice, Patients &amp;amp; the Public) indicate that we were successful in these aims, prompting new research ideas and cross-fertilisation of ideas across research domains.

In the short-term, an important pathway to impact for this research is through an ongoing project that aims develop cognitive training paradigms to improve complex problem solving (&amp;quot;fluid intelligence&amp;quot;) in high-performing individuals. Fluid intelligence ability is a strong predictor of academic success, lifetime earnings and other significant life outcomes, such that enhancement through training could confer very valuable individual and societal benefits. Insights from the BBSRC-funded research directly informed the design of the cognitive training regime, for example regarding inclusion of complex tasks relying on learning from feedback.

In the medium-term, a notable pathway to impact for the research is through educational applications of our discoveries about the role of high-level beliefs and knowledge on the learning process. The BBSRC-funded research showed that people interpret and use feedback very differently according to whether or not they perceive the feedback as informative. In educational settings, interpreting feedback (e.g., exam marks, teacher comments) is a crucial part of the learning process, but little is known about how this interpretative process takes place. A project currently in development aims to develop themes from the BBSRC-funded research to develop new theories and methods for characterising how learning is shaped by beliefs and experience regarding feedback.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0CE80353-551A-45F5-8AE2-2DD27A692024</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research funded on this grant investigated how people predict and learn from the consequences of their actions, using a combination of carefully designed computerised tasks, brain imaging measures, and computer models of the learning process. The key discoveries from the research are as follows:

1) When actions lead to positive outcomes such as rewards, unique patterns of learning and brain activity are triggered. When reward is delivered, preceding events such as the stimulus seen, the task performed, and the specific action chosen become linked strongly together (or &amp;quot;bound&amp;quot;). As a consequence, subsequent experience of one of these elements (e.g., seeing the same stimulus) leads to activation of all other elements. In the brain, we see this binding effect in terms of reward causing reactivation of patterns of brain activity corresponding to stimulus and response events. For example, if a person sees a blurred image but correctly recognises it as a face, when positive feedback is delivered we see activity in brain areas linked to visual processing of faces. We propose that this reactivation is crucial to learning correct associations between stimuli, tasks and actions-that is, it is crucial to learning how to act effectively and appropriately in the world.

2) People's ability to learn from feedback is strongly affected by their expectations about the task they are learning-in psychological terms, learning is influenced by starting knowledge and beliefs as much as by feedback provided. This idea contrasts with current theories of the learning process and how it operates in the brain. In our experiments, we asked people to learn simple rules which could change unpredictably (just as they do in the real world). We found that learning was influenced by simple instructions: When we told people that rules were unlikely to change, they tended to ignore negative feedback even when it was importantly signalling that they needed to change their behaviour. Conversely, telling them that rules were likely to change helped them learn new rules quickly, but led them to over-interpret negative feedback that was not actually informative. In the brain, we found correlates of these learning effects in terms of enhanced brain activity following feedback that people believed to be informative, regardless of how surprising and informative the feedback actually was.

Collectively, these results supported our initial hypothesis that high-level beliefs and goals strongly influence the learning process, and conversely that learning from rewards shapes the way we choose and perform actions. Our findings have been published in two scientific papers to date, with at least three further planned publications. In addition to these scientific discoveries, the research funded by this grant provided cutting-edge scientific training to a postdoctoral research scientist and ten student researchers. A workshop organised on the topic of the project brought together experts in a range of disciplines including education, clinical applications of neuroscience research, and social psychology, as well as over 100 delegates from around the world, to stimulate new ideas and to showcase our research findings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings shed new light on basic mechanisms of human learning, with potentially widespread implications. Examples include:
1) In an ongoing project, we are developing cognitive training tasks that aim to improve complex problem solving (&amp;quot;fluid intelligence&amp;quot;) in high-performing individuals. Insights from the BBSRC-funded research directly informed the design of this training, for example regarding inclusion of complex tasks relying on learning from feedback. 
2) In a project in development, we aim to show that people do not only learn from feedback, but also learn about the properties of the feedback itself (e.g. about its reliability). This project will bridge from the current basic science to applications of the research in educational settings, where interpreting feedback (e.g., exam marks, teacher comments) is a crucial part of the learning process.
3) Our findings are applicable to understanding decision making in gambling. Existing research shows that problem gamblers often have mistaken beliefs, for example about their level of control over outcomes of their bets. The paradigms we have developed provide new ways to test this hypothesis and more precisely characterise how mistaken beliefs could lead to pathological disturbances of the learning process that maintain problematic gambling behaviours.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D5FD8E3F-0ACC-459C-AE87-BCF14E48483F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Oxford Symposium on Outcome Prediction in Attention, Learning and Cognitive Control</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8911B955-71B9-4322-B023-D3DD7A8E9F36</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C6A6531F-0D2F-4103-9809-92BBA0BC3506"><gtr:id>C6A6531F-0D2F-4103-9809-92BBA0BC3506</gtr:id><gtr:title>Monetary Reward Modulates the Binding of Stimulus-Response Learning Components</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Currently under revision for resubmission</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c2128744136eea5e8a65c008da7fbca4"><gtr:id>c2128744136eea5e8a65c008da7fbca4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Moutsopoulou, K.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/49DE3E6E-65D8-45DC-A3D5-927D76F4C7AC"><gtr:id>49DE3E6E-65D8-45DC-A3D5-927D76F4C7AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reward activates stimulus-specific and task-dependent representations in visual association cortices.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/759fcc84a52642a691e32a09bebe6868"><gtr:id>759fcc84a52642a691e32a09bebe6868</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schiffer AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0270-6474</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9354621F-B294-447C-AB11-576384F6E35A"><gtr:id>9354621F-B294-447C-AB11-576384F6E35A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adaptive behaviour and feedback processing integrate experience and instruction in reinforcement learning.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>NeuroImage</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/759fcc84a52642a691e32a09bebe6868"><gtr:id>759fcc84a52642a691e32a09bebe6868</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schiffer AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1053-8119</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0CACFD58-6C9A-4D2D-9129-293882819610"><gtr:id>0CACFD58-6C9A-4D2D-9129-293882819610</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of prediction and outcomes in adaptive cognitive control.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of physiology, Paris</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/759fcc84a52642a691e32a09bebe6868"><gtr:id>759fcc84a52642a691e32a09bebe6868</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schiffer AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0928-4257</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I019847/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
