Recordings consist in time-series and are collected via multiple electrodes at the surface of the skull. Mathematical operations allow decomposing those recordings into more easy interpretable signals to examine, for instance, different frequencies (e.g. slow and fast fluctuations of the signal). There is currently no tool allowing the statistical assessment of all the EEG dimensions simultaneously (all electrodes, all time points and all frequencies together). Our project aims at providing a freely distributed toolbox allowing such analyses, therefore providing a new way to investigate a lot of research data and potentially generating important new knowledge about the brain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In recent years, new ways to investigate EEG recordings have emerged. In particular, Event Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSP) and Inter-Trial phase Coherence (ITC) have become the standard to characterize the time-frequency decompositions of signals from electrodes or components (e.g. from independent component analysis). Yet, no adequate statistical tools are available to investigate all the dimensions of ERSP and ITC at once: all electrodes/components, time frames, frequencies, amplitude and phase. Our project will provide a freely distributed toolbox allowing such comprehensive analyses. The toolbox will be based on mass-univariate robust statistics and validated multiple comparison correction procedures. This tool will improve significantly data analysis standards. Having such tool will also expand the spectrum of possible experiments, which are currently often limited to binary designs (e.g. condition A vs. condition B), simply because there is no good way to analyse more complex experiments. In turn, this will lead to an increase in our understanding of biological and psychological phenomena. The toolbox will be distributed along with datasets used to validate our methods so that user can familiarise themselves with the new techniques and other research groups can use them to compare methods.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our new tool will benefit public and private sector researchers using magneto- and electro-encephalography data analysis. We anticipate five main outcomes from our work:
[1] Researchers will not have to limit their analyses to a-priori interesting features. Instead, they will be able to exploit the full data space.
[2] Our tool will effectively control the negative consequences of exploring a full data space: false positive will be minimized without sacrificing power.
[3] Researchers will have the possibility to analyse more complex designs that cannot be managed by current toolboxes. This should enable researchers to use more sophisticated experimental designs and ask new questions about brain activity.
[4] The free availability of datasets from our own simulations will be useful for validation of methods by other research groups or for people to familiarise themselves with the new techniques.
[5] Overall, our work will contribute to the on-going paradigm shift in MEEG: away from simple group analyses of few regions of interests, and towards higher standards, including comprehensive analyses of single-subject and group data.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11637</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EEGLAB workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4B46706-3BA7-4537-A73D-120BB91084F0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My workshop about robust statistics applied to EEG/ERP analyses sparkled a lot of long and passionate discussions that day and the following days.

Mathematical operations allow decomposing those recordings into more easy interpretable signals to examine, for instance, different frequencies (e.g. slow and fast fluctuations of the signal) or components (the likely cerebral origins making up the recorded signal). In this research we developed tools / software that allow analysing the entire data space simultaneously, as for instance all electrodes on the scalp for all time points collected and throughout all temporal frequencies. 

Concretely, we have written code for methods (and validated them through simulations) that allow researchers to perform many statistical tests on the data (that is for the whole data space), while ensuring the results are not just due to chance (a problem known as control of family-wise error rate). These tools are coded in a popular mathematical language/software (MATLAB), are freely available, and are also distributed through another software commonly used to analyse EEG data (EEGLAB).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The tools developed are freely available under GPL. This implies that the research outcomes can be (1) used by anyone and (2) incorporated and developed for any other purpose than initially intended.
In addition of making sure that this work can be reused, it has been promoted via publications and via the participation of the applicants to workshops and conferences. Future specialist workshops are planned to present the tools and software developed.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>24DFAF96-1271-44F5-9D78-8DCDB80FF0B5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://gforge.dcn.ed.ac.uk/gf/project/limo_eeg/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>LIMO EEG is an open source Matlab toolbox for the linear modelling of EEG data.
