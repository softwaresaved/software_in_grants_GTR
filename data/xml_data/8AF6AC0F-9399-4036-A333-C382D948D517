How? Phonetically, is the shape of the tongue inside the speaker?s vocal tract perceptible?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project brings these questions together, to investigate how dialect, speech production and speech perception are related. It had previously been thought (on the basis of US English) that differing tongue shapes can be used by different people to articulate the consonant /r/ in a random way, with no sociolinguistic function. Either the tongue tip curls upwards, or points downwards to create a broad bunched shape, a difference apparently impossible to hear.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project looks at these articulatory shapes of /r/, which our previous ESRC work found to vary socially in&amp;nbsp; Scottish English. If this difference can?t be heard, how can&amp;nbsp; the &amp;quot;speaker-hearer chain&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; create and transmit this social variation in tongue shape? What does get transmitted?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will directly measure speakers? tongue shapes, play just the acoustic recordings of /r/ types to listeners, who will mimic what they hear, then measure their tongue shape. This will uncover whether listeners can perceive and reproduce the differences in shape, or whether other differences we will measure such as the timing of the articulation matter more.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>185059</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Block Seminar on sound change, Hannover 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E668D435-F173-4A45-9729-2EDAAB7B2726</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited intensive Block Seminar (entire seminar course, 28 hours, taught over 4 days), on sound change.

It is difficult to quantify the impact of this event; however, some children were very interested in the ultrasound machine and returned again and again to look at their tongue moving, experimenting with producing different speech sounds. At one venue, a young boy took over the demonstration and began showing people how to apply gel to the probe, where to place it under their chin and described their speech movements to them. I believe that the demonstration stimulated an interest in speech articulation for the children who returned again and again to the demo. As I said, it is very difficult to quantify what the long-term impact of this interest will be.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sounds and ultrasound in Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DED242D1-4E99-4DA4-9178-D6CDFD3D8C22</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited lecture at GIPSA-Lab, Grenoble.

We showed the difficulty a normative speaker group has discretely copying the tongue gestures underlying speech. If short-term articulatory adaptation is difficult for speakers who have no speech and hearing disorders, it must be even more problematic for those who do. We suggested that visual biofeedback (based on articulatory analysis techniques ultrasound tongue imaging and electropalatography) may improve speaker-hearers' adaptation to new speech production strategies. We presented our results at a Visual Biofeedback workshop (5th May 2014) at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh with a primarily SLT audience with hands-on ultrasound training, and at a special session &amp;quot;Novel impact pathways in Variationist Linguistics&amp;quot; at NWAV, Chicago (25th October 2014), with an audience of mainly variationist researchers. This special session promoted the view that variationist research can have impact outside of its immediate domain, e.g. in SLT practice. Practical innovation and improvement of research practice: In order to carry out this project, we designed and produced a bite plate that can be used in conjunction with ultrasound tongue imaging to identify and capture the speaker's occlusal (bite) plane. Capturing the bite plane helps standardise the angle of the ultrasound probe in relation to the speaker's head and improves inter-speaker comparability. Bite plates are now used as standard at the CASL speech lab, QMU, and we have made bite plates for researchers at other major ultrasound labs in the UK and distributed them at conferences and talks. We have also made enquiries concerning the commercial production of bite plates. Societal/Cultural impact: media: A Press release on July 10th 2015 sparked a huge amount of media and public interest and resulted in our research findings on the weakening of Scottish /r/ being reported in most national, numerous local and some international newspapers, including: The Sunday Times (front page) 19/07/2015; The Guardian; The Independent; The Times (Scotland); The Scotsman; The Herald; The Daily Mirror; The Daily Record; the Daily Mail; 20/07/2015; Quartz 10/07/2015 and Le Monde 22/07/2015. We were also asked to take part in radio interviews on BBC Radio 4's Today programme; BBC World Service; BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland 20/07/2015; BBC radio Ulster 21/07/2015 and PRI The World (BBC co-production in Boston USA) 22/07/2015 - also an interview for a podcast on Linguistics by PRI. After the radio broadcasts, we were contacted by many members of the public who wanted to know more about our research or express their opinion on accent changes. Comments sections in newspapers that printed out research results typically contained a large number of comments and lively discussion. Public engagement: We have used our findings in a number of ultrasound-focussed public engagement activities with the aim of teaching members of the public about speech production and accent variation, including: a public lecture at the Glasgow Science Festival (15th June 2014) &amp;quot;Changing Voices - Workshop 2 - Seeing Tongues Speak&amp;quot; (rated excellent by all attendees); two hands-on demonstrations of UTI at a library and community centre in Anniesland, Glasgow (16th July 2014) and Drumchapel, Glasgow (21st July 2014) respectively. The audience for these demonstrations were members of the public (around 100 attendees per session); a 'Meet the Expert' event at Glasgow Science Centre (30th May 2015). Around 100 attendees from small children to their grandparents. Digital Information impact: The results of this project led directly to a related series of knowledge-exchange/impact projects, funded first by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland and then the Arts and Humanities Research Council under their Big Data scheme. These grants funded the creation of a set of freely available digital resources, a Youtube channel (ArticulatoryIPA), and two linked Web resources, Seeing Speech and Dynamic Dialects, which enabled the insights from our fundamental research carried out in this project, to be exploited by making accessible information, films and animations of speech production using Ultrasound Tongue Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and lip movement cameras. The key issue was the need to be able to allow anyone with an interest in speech to be able to find out more about speech production, without needing to have specialised software to do so. The impacts of this subsequent work are reported now through the Dynamic Dialects AHRC grant ResearchFish, but they rest on the work of this project and others before it (e.g. Looking variation and change in the mouth; the Ultrax project). To date non-academic users are speech and language therapists, language learners and teachers, including English as a Second/Foreign Language, voice and drama coaches, teachers and students more generally, the general public. We are currently in the early stages of a collaboration with an ESL teaching department at a college in the United States, which will produce an imaging-based tool for teaching English. Education impact: The web resources described above have both impact for a range of non-academic users. They have also been important resources for teaching phonetics in other HEIs beyond QMU and Glasgow. We are aware of a number of HEIs both in the UK and beyond (e.g. Europe, the US) which are now regularly using these resources. The section below also notes that this research has led to invitations to speak to more educationally orientated workshops, such as the Phonetics Teaching and Learning conference, the Association for Learners and Teachers of English (France), and international undergraduate (e.g. Hannover, Germany) and postgraduate summer schools (e.g. Dublin, Ireland). Academic impact: We presented papers at 10 conferences: BAAP 2012 and 2014; NWAV 42 and 43, r-atics 4; Methods in Dialectology XV, Ultrafest VI and VII (forthcoming); Labphon 14 and ICPhS 18 and have published six papers relating to: social stratification of tongue shape in /r/ production; the role of gesture timing in coda /r/ weakening; the impact of covert articulatory /r/ variants on the prerhotic vowel systems; speaker mimicry strategies for covert /r/ variants; onset-coda asymmetry in /r/ and real-time change in Scottish postvocalic /r/. Our research has shown that apparently covert articulatory /r/ variants (retroflex and bunched) are perceptible and can be used by speakers to signal social-class affiliation. Other researchers have previously stated that that these two strategies produce a similar acoustic output and that their use by speakers is idiosyncratic. We have shown that use of bunched /r/ variants can lead to the coalescence of vowel + /r/ in the syllable rime and also promote prerhotic vowel merger. We have shown that variation in gesture timing is a key mechanism leading to the loss of coda /r/. We have shown that there appears to be syllabic asymmetry in tongue shape for /r/ production, with tip-up variants preferred in onset position and bunched variants preferred in coda position (across a variety of datasets). Finally, we have shown that /r/-loss in Scottish English is a very slow moving sound change by carrying out a real-time study spanning 100 years. We were invited to present a plenary paper involving our /r/ research at the Phonetics Teaching and Learning conference, UCL, 6/08/2015, and to present a plenary and workshop at the Sociolinguistics Summer School 6, Trinity College Dublin, 8/08/2015.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D84662B0-1460-4613-9869-02CFBCB7FFED</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. We confirmed the results of an earlier and smaller study in the eastern Scottish Central Belt. We showed that middle-class and working-class adolescents produce postvocalic /r/ with markedly different tongue shapes across central Scotland. The current study used a new corpus collected in the western Scottish Central Belt in which an even clearer pattern of theoretically-important social stratification was observed.
2. We showed, for the first time, the transmission of phonetic variation from an articulatory perspective, i.e. that speakers are able to adapt the movements of their vocal organs to match subtle variation in unseen vocal organ movements of another person from the audio signal only. When presented with audio stimuli containing /r/ and asked to mimic the audio stimulus, the most common response was not to deviate from habitual tongue configuration for /r/ (around half of the speakers studied did not change their tongue shape). The second most common response was non-discrete adaptation, that is, when mimicking the audio stimulus, participants altered from their usual strategy for producing /r/, but did not consistently differentiate between the two social types of /r/ they were being presented with. We observed blending of alternate strategies for producing /r/ and perseveration of the effect of previously heard examples. The rarest type of adaptation was discrete adaptation where speakers were able to match the tongue configuration of each stimulus presented to them with a high level of accuracy.
3. We demonstrated that variation in the Scottish vowel system is caused by underlying differences in tongue shape during the production of /r/. We were able to show that a prerhotic vowel merger in words such as fir, fur and fern that had previously been considered an anglicisation is actually due to differences in the tongue shape for the following /r/. Speakers who had a bunched /r/ produced fir, fur, fern with one, strongly rhotic, vowel. Ultrasound analysis showed that tongue shape during the vowel portion of these words was very similar to the tongue shape during /r/. In other words, the vowel and the /r/ have coalesced, perhaps creating a new vowel, &amp;quot;schwar&amp;quot;. No such vowel adaptation or merger occurred where speakers used an /r/ with a raised tongue tip. 
4. We showed that weakening of postvocalic /r/ in e.g. car, heard, form etc. results mainly from changes in the timing of tongue gestures and to a lesser extent a reduction of the /r/ gesture (i.e. production of a weaker gesture that doesn't fully reach its target). Recordings where /r/ was rated absent or weak almost always contained a full /r/ gesture, but it was timed to occur late, so that it was masked by a following silence or a following consonant, making the /r/ only partially audible. In other words, weakening and deletion of this consonant can result from changes in timing of tongue movements rather than simple weakening.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are of relevance to speech and language therapists (SLTs) who use speech modelling of a range of sounds.
