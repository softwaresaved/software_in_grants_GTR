The aim of this new project is to gain a detailed understanding of how the arrival of a new baby affects women?s productivity and how family planning and other reproductive health services can help women returning to good health and work.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This multi-disciplinary project includes three sub-studies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sub-study A is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data collected in Burkina Faso from 2001-2006.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sub-study B is a cohort study of women identified in the community during pregnancy and the first trimester after childbirth. Over a period of nine months, women will be interviewed three times about their health, preparations they made for childbirth and the period after childbirth, changes in paid work (or education) and domestic work, fertility intention and contraceptive needs. Interviewers will measure women's blood pressure and whether they have anaemia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In sub-study C, qualitative methods will document how women and their family make decisions on work, childbirth and family planning. Sub-study C will re-interview a sub-sample of cohort women, observe some of them in their daily activities, and interview men, policy makers as well as health care providers.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect our results to have direct relevance to economics, health and development professionals, and other societal stakeholders, working in the governmental and non-governmental sectors since our findings can be used to develop interventions to assist households in preparing for birth and the postpartum period, and to promote effective family planning methods after childbirth. Also, as a representative of a NGO specialising in family planning told us during the our planning workshop, the study results could help demonstrate the economic advantages of vigorous family planning provision to the pro-natalist government. We have decided to include the perspectives of husbands/partners in Study C in order to increase the relevance and transferability of our results, since men play an important role in decision-making related to fertility and women's work in Burkina Faso.

To ensure our results are applicable to policy and practice at the country-level we have adapted our original research proposal in response to feedback received from PopDev reviewers and from stakeholders at our planning workshop, held in Ouagadougou in May 2012. We have also planned ongoing communication activities to keep interested parties updated on progress. Our plans for stakeholder engagement are detailed in the full proposal attached. In brief, our target groups are:

In Burkina Faso:
1. Research participants and their communities
2. Regional and national policy-makers in key departments (Health, Promotion of Women, Work &amp;amp; Social Security).
3. Interested Members of Parliament, in particular female MPs
4. Local bureau of international organizations (such as UNFPA, WHO, World Bank)
5. NGOs working in reproductive health and/or family planning, e.g. ABBEF; MSI; White Ribbon Alliance.
6. Health workers who provide reproductive health services
7. Local researchers (e.g. from Association Koasanga, IRSS etc)
8. National and local media

Internationally:
9. Policy makers working in relevant multilateral organisations, including the WHO working group on maternal morbidity
10. Donor organisations, particularly those working on gender issues and reproductive health
11. Wider community of academics

Ongoing communication activities will be targeted to the stakeholder group throughout the study, but with more concentrated activities during the planning phase (December 2012-April 2013), the dissemination of Study A (May-June 2013), and the dissemination of Studies B and C (July-November 2014). For policy makers these will include face-to-face meetings, e-mails with study updates, bilingual (French/English) web pages hosted on our institutional websites, and the production of at least one policy brief (sent to key stakeholders and made available on the website). One of the participants at our stakeholder workshop presents a regular radio programme discussing women's issues; broadcast in a number of local languages, and we discussed disseminating our findings via such media.

In June 2015, key findings on each of these thematic areas were presented at a dissemination workshop with stakeholders from a range of backgrounds (NGOs working on reproductive health and rights, Ministries of Family Affairs and Social Security, Health, Women's affairs etc) in Burkina Faso. The findings were summarised in a research brief (available in French and English), which were both printed and published on the websites of AfricSant&amp;eacute; and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Great interest was expressed at the workshop for the novelty and complexity of our topic, bringing together reproductive health issues as well as issues related to women's work, and several ground-breaking recommendations were made at the workshop to stimulate potential social and health policy changes.
The workshop's main recommendations included:
1. Communicating that the importance of family planning (women and couples having the desired number of children when wanted) requires the involvement of multiple sectors such as ministries in charge of the condition of women, social action, and work, and does not entirely fall under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health;
2. Informing women working in the formal economy, as well as their employer, of their existing rights to maternity leave; 
3. Encouraging the government to ensure access to existing mechanisms of social protection and introduce new ones, particularly aimed at those with temporary contracts or active in the informal sector;
4. Encouraging families to subscribe to a health protection system and Burkina Faso to promote universal access to health care; 
5. Raising awareness among young boys and girls on gender equality during their education; 
6. Encouraging male participation in maternal and reproductive health, household activities, and ensuring that health services involve husbands/future fathers as appropriate 
7. Explaining to women that it takes time to get back to a normal health state during the postpartum; and stressing the importance of a good nutrition and a delay in engaging in physical activities.

Unfortunately during the past year, there have been major disturbances and changes among stakeholders and policy makers due to the revolution of autumn 2015 and the terrorist attacks in January 2016, and we have not found ourselves in a position where we could easily follow-up on these recommendations. The political situation is now stable and our scientific papers in preparation will enable us to resume these discussions when published. One incredibly important policy change is that Burkina Faso has now made maternity care completely free of charge. While difficult to prove, the evidence that has accumulated through our collaborative research over the past several years, with this ESRC grant and other research funded by ESRC and other funders, both motivated and contributed to the development of this landmark policy.

With respect to recommendation 6, it is important to note that Marina Daniele, an ESRC-funded 1+3 PhD student associated to this work, will complete her doctoral thesis at the end of 2016 and will have further recommendations on how to involve men in maternity services and family planning decision making in Burkina Faso and other settings. These recommendations will also be actively disseminated with the continued support of STEP-UP (a DFID-funded Research Programme Consortium on reproductive health).
At the global level, our research fits extremely well with the Sustainable Development Goals agenda and, we think, can help inform joined-up responses to the complex interactions between the goals of health and wellbeing (goal 3), gender equality (goal 5), decent work and economic growth (goal 8). Our focus on social protection in relation to reproductive health is particularly relevant in this respect. Finally, our research has also enabled us to inform the agenda of the department of Reproductive Health and Research at the World Health Organisation by contributing to discussions on the importance of measuring health-related functioning for maternal health.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>961E4435-A6BA-4680-843D-9AE3F7AE6350</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Despite their high fertility, 82% of women in Burkina Faso work outside of the home. The majority of these women work within the informal economy where labour conditions are precarious and incomes low and unpredictable. Moreover, Burkinabe women face a double burden of income-generating activities and labour-intensive domestic and agricultural work, even during pregnancy. This PopDev project examined women's work in Burkina Faso and how their reproductive health, pregnancy and childbirth impacted on their productivity, a topic that is relevant to the global sustainable development agenda and to the &amp;quot;Women and Health&amp;quot; Lancet Commission from 2015. The project involved interdisciplinary collaboration between public health researchers and social scientists from Burkina Faso, the UK and Norway, and generated new research opportunities and policy debate. Our findings show that women in Burkina Faso are still far from achieving gender parity in reproductive and work-related issues. For example: 
- Women are active in the workforce (six of ten pregnant/delivered women in our study), but spend more time of domestic activities than income-generating work. 
- Women's income is low, but it is very important to their sense of independence and well-being. 
- Women are largely excluded from the national social security system, because they rarely have formal employment. Of the working women in our study, nine out of 10 women worked in the informal sector (e.g. petty trading and other services).
- Despite their legal right to 14 weeks' maternity leave, only half of women in the formal sector get maternity leave.
- Women struggle to prepare for the costs of delivery and the loss or reduction of income during pregnancy and in the first months after childbirth.
- Semi-formal social protection mechanisms like group savings and help from neighbours and family members are important to help women cope with loss of income during pregnancy and after childbirth. 
- Women return to work quickly after delivery. Women reduce their workload in the weeks before and after childbirth, but resume domestic work around a week after delivery and income-generating activities within two month. Rural women and those who work in the informal sector often return to work sooner to avoid impoverishment. 
- Family planning could help women achieve their work-related ambitions, but is often opposed by men. Although only 1% of women in our study wanted a new pregnancy within the next two years, only 45% of sexually active women used contraception after delivery.
On the basis of these findings, we recommend that: 
- Burkina Faso's government should work to improve knowledge and implementation of existing social protection mechanisms for formal sector workers, and develop mechanisms to protect informal sector workers against loss of income and work opportunities during pregnancy and childbirth
- 'Postpartum preparedness', including logistics and financial planning during pregnancy for postnatal care, family planning and work, should be considered for inclusion in public health programmes as a way to help women prepare better for the period after delivery. 
- Research and policy should address men's involvement in reproductive health decision-making, especially with regard to family planning.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are actively disseminating our findings to non-academic audiences, with support from our colleagues in the POPPOV network, who advise us on public dissemination of scientific research. 
In June 2015, we organised a workshop with Burkinabe stakeholders on the policy implications of our findings, and disseminated a research brief which included multi-sectorial recommendations on family planning and reproductive rights. We have/will reinforce these messages through local presentations and publications in French.
Our findings may also be taken forward through inter-disciplinary research, for instance on men's involvement in family planning, how to improve 'preparedness' for loss of work and income during pregnancy and after childbirth, the social significance of women's work, and the development and implementation of social protection mechanisms in contexts with large informal sectors. 
As a direct outcome of this study, one of the study participants (Marine Daniele) has been awarded an ESRC doctoral studentship to conduct a randomised control trial to test whether increasing men's contact with providers and access to information can increase uptake of family planning, postnatal care and exclusive breastfeeding. Another study participant (Seydou Drabo) has received a University of Oslo doctoral fellowship for an anthropological study on the circulation of contraceptives within Burkina Faso. 
We will continue to take our findings forward in the consultations which are organised by the UK Research Council and the Department for International Development and other funders on the research agenda that will accompany the new SDGs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E4462D31-B9D0-4524-AC30-E6CB7A86C94D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://maternalhealthgroup.lshtm.ac.uk/resources-3/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>World Health Organization working group on maternal morbidity (2012-2017)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>935704FF-1532-434B-8343-22C6F5E0469E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>quantitative data collected during the study</gtr:description><gtr:id>AF2DB18B-10DA-45B9-9200-C18034907B1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>x</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Productivity, family planning and reproductive health in Burkina Faso: the PopDev study quantitative data</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://datacompass.lshtm.ac.uk/64/</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>qualitative data collected for the popdev project</gtr:description><gtr:id>0BDE0D2F-281F-4AD6-9CDC-2395EC32EB48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>x</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Productivity, family planning and reproductive health in Burkina Faso: PopDev qualitative data</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://datacompass.lshtm.ac.uk/108/</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K011049/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80A901A1-6A1F-4860-A8F4-3D3FE7D528E2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Reproductive and sexual health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
