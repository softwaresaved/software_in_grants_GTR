Understanding the basic causes will aid in diagnosis and counselling and in some instances even treatment. From our understanding of germ cell development in lower organisms we have chosen to study one interesting group of genes, those involved in the exchange and partitioning of genetic information, changes in which are a potential source of infertility. The work proposed is designed to test this idea. A second goal is to develop a model organism as an experimental system for understanding the why changes in these genes are a source of human infertility. A third goal is to study the control of the exchange of genetic information in normal sperm development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Errors of meiosis lead to aneuploidy and infertility, both of which are common problems in humans. Although a number of causes of infertility are known, the genetic basis for most cases is unclear. This project has three aspects, all designed to better understand the genetic and molecular basis for male human infertility. The first of these will be accomplished by testing for an association between mutations within a class of genes known to cause sterility in lower organisms and human male infertility. The genes of interest are MLH1, MLH3, MSH4, MSH5, EXO1, DMC1, SPO11, BLM and TOP3b. All of these genes play a role in meiotic recombination and/or chromosome segregation in model organisms, and, with the exception of BLM, deletion of each has been shown to cause infertility in mice. However, male Bloom Syndrome patients are infertile. Thus they are all promising candidate genes for human infertility. Using custom made Affymetrix GeneChips we will sequence the genes in approximately eighty men with oligozoospermia or non obstructive azoospermia (reduced or no sperm respectively) to identify potential mutations. Once these have been identified we will determine the frequency of these changes in fertile men and more patient samples to determine if they are specifically found in the patient population. The second aspect of the project involves replacing the yeast copy of some of these genes with a human cDNA and assessing the ability of the human gene to complement the phenotypes of the yeast deletion. Three of these genes, BLM, hEXO and hMLH1 have previously been demonstrated to partially complement the mitotic phenotypes of the yeast deletions. However, because these genes interact with each other and function as complexes we propose to combine as many as possible into a single cell thus ?humanizing yeast?. Once such a system has been developed it can be used to test the phenotypic consequences of identified mutations or polymorphisms of the human genes. The final aspect of the project is to measure crossover frequencies by single sperm analysis at well characterized hotspots and to determine if reduced crossover frequencies are associated with infertility (in those men producing sufficient sperm) and/or particular gene mutations.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2004-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>544078</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Frank may Prize Lecture</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>1A7FE587-66A4-474E-A120-6E1724B18CC4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented a public lecture relating to my research
