There is emerging evidence that the consequences of such nutrition during pregnancy can be passed to grandchildren even when their daughters have adequate nutrition during pregnancy. These effects have been replicated in the offspring of rats fed a diet with reduced protein content during pregnancy. We have identified a mechanism by which poor nutrition during pregnancy can result in changes to how genes are controlled in the fetus and give which result in increased risk of disease in a future generation. This process of gene control is called epigenetics. In this project we will use the rat model to investigate the mechanism by which the diet of the mother changes the epigenetic control of genes in the next three generations of offspring. We already have evidence that this involves an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase-1 in the first generation and now we need to determine whether this enzyme is involved in subsequent generations. We have also shown adding folic acid to the mother's diet prevents changes in the epigenetic control of genes in the first generations. We will investigate whether folic acid can prevent changes in epigenetic control in successive generations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Epidemiological studies and animal models show that poor nutrition before birth induces phenotypes associated with increased risk of non-communicable diseases, transmitted at least to the second generation. We have shown that induction of an altered metabolic phenotype in the offspring of rats fed a protein-restricted (PR) diet during pregnancy involves hypomethylation of specific gene promoters by a mechanism in which lower expression and binding activity of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt)-1s has a central role. These effects were prevented by increasing the folic acid content of the PR diet. We are the first to show that induction of hypomethylation of the hepatic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and PPARa in the F1 offspring by feeding a PR diet to F0 dams was transmitted to the F2 offspring through the female line even though F1 females received adequate nutrition. This study will investigate how changes in the epigenetic regulation of genes and altered metabolic phenotype are transmitted between generations. We will test the overall hypothesis that altered epigenetic regulation of Dnmt1s is transmitted between generations and that in each generation promoter methylation of specific genes is established by the activities of other Dnmts in oocytes and early embryos, but is lost during subsequent development due to lower Dnmt1s activity. We will use the well-established rat model of feeding a PR diet during pregnancy to investigate the epigenetic regulation of Dnmts by DNA methylation in oocytes and liver in three generations of offspring. Epigenotype and metabolic phenotype will be assessed in each generation by the methylation status and expression of hepatic GR and PPARa, expression of target genes and by markers of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation. We will also determine whether increasing maternal folic acid intake during pregnancy interrupts transmission of altered epigenetic regulation and thus of adverse phenotypes between generations.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>463006</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Dr Tobias Uller, University of Oxford</gtr:description><gtr:id>45932E25-92A2-4FE8-B828-92463FF083D9</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>The findings of the project have implications for understanding the mechanisms by which maternal effects contribute to the persistence of species in novel environments which may be important in evolutionary biology.

The purpose of this project was to investigate the mechanism underlying the passage of phenotypes between generations.



We fed F0 rats an adequate or protein-restricted (PR) diet during pregnancy and then characterised the ability of their non pregnant and pregnant female offspring to maintain fasting glucose and lipid homeostasis in three subsequent generations.

We found that the standard diet used to modify protein intake increased total dietary energy by approximately 25% compared to the breeding colony diet, which was sustained throughout the life course of the subsequent generations.



When incorporated into the analysis and compared to rats fed the breeding colony diet, this provided novel insights into the transmission of altered phenotypes between generations. We found that increased energy intake induced in pregnant and

non-pregnant F1 offspring raised fasting blood glucose concentration, body weight and energy intake, and lowered liver fatty acid beta-oxidation. These effects were partly ameliorated in the F3 generation despite continued exposure to the higher energy diet. 



These metabolic changes were accompanied by differences in the mRNA expression of specific genes involved in fasting glucose (glucocorticoid receptor, phosphoenolpyruvate carboykinase (PEPCK)) and fat metabolism (including PPARalpha and carnitine palmitoyl transferase -1) in the liver of the offspring. Altered PEPCK mRNA expression was accompanied by altered methylation of individual CpG dinucleotides in its promoter which were shown to be functionally important for transcription and differ between generations. Feeding F0 dams a PR diet decreased the number of generations over which phenotypic and epigenetic change occurred. Folic acid supplementation of pregnant dams did not prevent the transmission of altered phenotype or epigenotype between generations. 



These findings suggest that when exposed to a persistent change in energy intake rats undergo metabolic and epigenetic adjustments between generations which appear to improve metabolic control. 



DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) 3a and 3b catalyse DNA methylation de novo. Dnmt3a was down-regulated in liver and gastrulating embryos of F1 offspring exposed to increased energy intake compared to other generations. This was accompanied by hypermethylation of two functionally important CpG dinucleotides in its promoter. There were no differences between groups or generations in the expression of the maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1 in liver or gastrulating embryos. There were no differences between generations or dietary lines in Dnmt expression in oocytes.

 

Together these findings suggest that induced changes in DNA methylation involve altered epigenetic regulation of specific Dnmts which may contribute to epigenetic changes between generations. Overall, our findings show that exposure to a sustained nutritional change induces phenotypic and epigenetic variation which appeared to facilitate metabolic adjustments between generations. One possible mechanism is that sequential phenotypic changes between generation may reflect induction of DNA methylation de novo in embryos in each generation. 



If so, then differences in the interaction between maternal physiology and the nutritional environment in each generation may provide differing signals to the developing offspring leading to different phenotypes and epigenotypes in each generation. These findings have implications for understanding how humans may respond over generations to environmental trends such as increased or decreased food abundance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this study provide the first insights into how organisms may adapt to environmental challenges. Translation of these initial observations into non-academic applications will require further studies. The findings provide a novel perspective on how organisms may adapt to new environments. In the context of the current epidemic of cardio-meatabolic disease, these results suggest that, if replicated in humans, projections of disease incidence and / or severity may be down graded for future generations. Similarly, in the context of climate change these findings suggest that at least some species may be able to adjust to environmental challenge through epigenetic mechanisms thus reducing specific decline.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CA1DE674-F1E2-428A-9D34-CCD7CA283F03</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A number of oligonucleoties probes have been developed for measuring DNA methylation by pyrosequencing</gtr:description><gtr:id>69F6B9DF-2727-4C4A-B402-43288738B6B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Tools for measuring DNA methylation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We carried out microarray analysis on liver samples collected from the offspring in each generations in order to clarify some of the observations on between-generation variation in gene expression.
