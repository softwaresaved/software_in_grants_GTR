Wilson: IODP Expedition 342 Palaeogene Newfoundland sediment drifts</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/K006800/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Carbon dioxide, CO2, is a powerful greenhouse gas and its concentration in Earth's atmosphere has increased by around 35% since the start of the Industrial Revolution (in ca. 250 yrs) to a level that is higher than at any time in the past 800 thousand years as measured in air bubbles obtained from ice cores. If man-made (anthropogenic) CO2 emissions to the atmosphere follow projected rates, then by 2100, concentrations will reach values not seen since the Palaeogene epoch (ca. 65-23 million years ago, Ma) when Earth's climate was much warmer than today, featuring, for example, a genuinely green Greenland. These startling observations provide a powerful incentive to improve our understanding of the workings of the Palaeogene climate system.

The Cenozoic palaeoclimate record is largely pieced together from the analysis of deep-sea sediments. It reveals a long-term climatic deterioration since the early Eocene (~55 Ma) with superimposed higher-frequency (10 to 100 thousand yearr timescale) variations including those paced by changes in Earth's orbit of the Sun and more extreme changes, both transient excursions and more persistent shifts in climate-state. In each case, the palaeoclimate archive indicates a close relationship between the climate signal observed and perturbation to the global carbon cycle.

To decipher the physical and biogeochemical mechanisms that forced these changes in climate and the responses (feedback effects) we must determine rates and full magnitude of the changes involved. Until now this has proved difficult because virtually all of our records of Palaeogene climate change come from sites where sediments accumulate very slowly (~ 1 cm per thousand years). Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition, IODP Exp., 342 is designed to solve this problem by drilling a series of holes at sites where deep-sea sediments have accumulated at unusually fast rates (10 to 25 cm per thousand years). IODP Exp. 342 will drill a depth transect between ~2400 and 5000 m water depth into a number of sediment drifts of Paleogene age that were swept and piled up under the influence flow path of the Deep Western Boundary Current on J Anomaly Ridge and Southeast Newfoundland Ridge. The drill site area is famous because it is the graveyard of RMS Titanic, which sank after colliding with an iceberg en route from Southampton, England, to New York City, USA, in April 1912 and of the Andrea Gail, the commercial swordfish vessel from Gloucester, Massachusetts, lost at sea with all hands during the &amp;quot;Perfect Storm&amp;quot; of October 1991. These sediments to be drilled will provide an archive of changes in chemistry, flow history, and depth structure of waters exiting the Nordic seas and Arctic Ocean during the transition from an ice-free world featuring a genuinely green Greenland and lush forests on Antarctica.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Who will benefit from this research?
This project will benefit the following specific users:
Palaeoceanographers &amp;amp; Palaeoclimatologists
Marine Geologists
Ocean &amp;amp; Climate scientists
Earth System Scientists
The wider community of scientists working on the problem of anthropogenic climate change
School children and the wider public excited by the exploration of the oceans and Earth.

2. How will they benefit from this research?
This project will make a significant scientific advancement towards understanding the stability of the most recent interval in Earth's history when CO2 levels in the atmosphere are thought to have been close to the levels projected for the year 2100. The records to be recovered will be of much higher temporal resolution than those previously obtained for this interval (we will drill into sea floor sediments with unusually high rates of deposition) and thereby make fundamental advances for those seeking to understand climate sensitivity (to CO2 forcing), ocean acidity and circulation changes associated with perturbations in the global carbon cycle and the stability of early ice sheets Knowledge of the stratigraphy of the Newfoundland sediment drifts acquired during Expedition 342 will inform plans to return to the Nerwfoundland sediment drifts and acquire comparative records for other intervals of geologic time (Neogene and Cretaceous).

3. What will be done to ensure that they benefit?
A number of activities will be undertaken. We will engage with the communities of Palaeoceanographers &amp;amp; Palaeoclimatologists, Marine Geologists, Ocean, Climate and Earth System scientists through attendance at conferences, participation in and hosting of workshops (eg. the Santa Cruz Cenozoic CCD meeting scheduled for Dec 2012; the London Cretaceous Ocean Dynamics meeting proposed for 2013) at no cost to this proposal. The PI and his co-chief scientist will feature the scientific results of Exp. 342 in invited talks and seminars at institutions around the world. The multidisciplinary nature of the science involved will naturally ensure that value is added through interaction with a broad scientific community.

At the request of the co-chief scientists, two dedicated scientific outreach professionals with extensive experience of IODP activities will participate in Exp. 342: Mr Dan Brinkhuis, a videographer and Ms Caitlin Scully, an education officer to ensure the widest public outreach.
