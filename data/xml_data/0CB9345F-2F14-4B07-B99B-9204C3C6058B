Arabidopsis is the most widely used model system to study plant biology and has delivered numerous breakthroughs in understanding of plant and basic biological processes. Arabidopsis has underpinned the genomic revolution in plant science and represents the template on which other plant and crop genomes are annotated and assessed. Arabidopsis data is key to modern crop science and through that to food security and quality of life. Our services are equally available to Universities, institutes, companies and international users through simple, intuitive interfaces. Distribution abroad requires the same infrastructure as a purely UK resource but adds value by encouraging international donation of stocks, supplementing grant income and helping to consolidate the Arabidopsis and wider plant Community. All European plant research groups requiring Arabidopsis stocks are obliged to use NASC but thousands of non-Europeans access our resource. We provide materials, data and guidance worldwide (~100,000 seed tubes per year); and our existence helps tens of thousands of users to save time, money and effort through centralised services. For Affymetrix Genechips we have released over 4,000 public data files. Our ethos is entirely open access and in the years that we have been running we have redistributed all of our data many times over to the general community and to secondary providers such as ArrayExpress and GEO. We service not only Arabidopsis researchers but are broader as can be seen from the range of letters of support attached to this proposal. Computer scientists, biophysicists, crop scientists, and systems biologists use the data and materials that we distribute (plus our core audience of plant biologists). Our GeneChip services have been used directly by a very broad range of users including veterinary, bioenergy, medical and phylogenetics researchers in the UK and abroad. To demonstrate the breadth of our molecular users, a selected list of funders for recent UK work performed using our GeneChip service includes: DEFRA; Syngenta; SCRI, Warwick HRI; FERA (The food and environment research Agency; DFID (Department for International Development); The University of Nottingham; Horserace Betting Levy Board; NIAB (National Institute of Agricultural Botany); HGCA; LINK collaborative research; YARA; BBSRC; John Innes Centre; Rothamsted Research. Outside of the UK we have molecular users from the US to China and from Norway to South Africa. We have also been useful to BBSRC policy makers and marketing by our inclusion in BBSRC publications: the BBSRC Data Sharing Policy documentation held NASC up as one of four examples of good practice; the 2009 BBSRC Bioscience Resources for Food Security pamphlet specifically flagged us as a key collection seed resource and our transcriptome analysis service as supporting the UK Food Security priority. We provide multiple UK transcriptomic training sessions per year to our customers; to MRes and MSc/PhD students (both Nottingham and beyond); and to visitors. We have also performed workshops annually at the GARNet meeting; given many international talks and workshops - e.g. a lecture series in Hangzhou [China Partnership award 2008]; and the Chips, Crops &amp;amp; Computers Summer School, Hangzhou [RCUK award 2009]. Our outreach is extensive, regular and user-oriented. We also regularly publish primary research papers as ongoing technical development of our services, for dissemination and techniques accessibility. NASC has always hosted the community GARNish newsletter / GARNet website and acts as a repository for the MASC (Multinational Arabidopsis Steering committee) newsletter. We have ex-officio membership of MASC and its sub-committees ( Phenomics, Bioinformatics, multiparallel tools). NASC has also spoken at all GARNet meetings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>780792</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The increasing demands of a growing, prosperous world for improved agricultural products including food, fibre and fuel, intensifies the need for an extensive understanding of the basic biology and ecology of plants. Arabidopsis is the most widely used model system to study plant biology and has delivered numerous breakthroughs in understanding of plant and basic biological processes.

The knowledge gained from studies in Arabidopsis serves to advance our understanding of other plant species, particularly crop species, and thus translates into new or improved plant products and increased agricultural productivity. Arabidopsis has underpinned the genomic revolution in plant science and represents the template on which other plant and crop genomes are annotated and assessed. Arabidopsis data is key to modern crop science and through that to food security and quality of life. 

We are the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre and send out ~100,000+ tubes of seed worldwide (140,000 in 2015-16). Any one of those tubes can enable or inform a project that may result in any of these impacts. Together with the US stock centre we support the world Arabidopsis community and our impact is through them.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A22E6E2B-641A-4235-8EA8-0DC0BEA6B9E4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There are more than 22,000 Arabidopsis researchers in &amp;gt;9,000 laboratories worldwide.

We generated the majority of the world public arabidopsis transcriptome data through our physical (early technical access) Affymetrix array service; and served this data without restriction to the world community. For the first few years we produced and released more transcriptomics data by volume than the Human or Mouse community (although because of the proliferation of participating sites we were overtaken once those communities and a few others had caught up on our lead). 

All of our data was given away [as per our remit] to collaborating and competing projects such as the EBI (ArrayExpress), GEO in the US, BAR in Canada, and many other academic sites and commercial entities such as GenevestigATor. As a natural consequence of the rapid proliferation in sites and analysis tools (tool development beyond basic access and correlation was not in our remit) and the increased ease of access to transcriptomc techniques, many of these other sites were (and are) largely dependent on the volume and quality of our data. 

Following BBSRC committee funding advice, we ended the NASCarrays database in 2013 and gracefully retired the data to these sites (especially GEO as the perceived dominant site). To ensure good data practice, we made appropriate safety backups at iPlant in the US and also have frozen-curation FTP access at NASC to all data. 

The arabidopsis community still uses our data, re-badged at other sites with variable levels of attribution to NASCarrays.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C43AE658-EB28-45C2-862C-2591C07A188C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We were the first centre to provide sufficient transcriptomic data in the reliable and reproducible Affymetrix format for real bioinformatic correlation studies. We were also used as domain champions for standards and the instantiation of such activities such as MIAME and large database integration activities. This was both in collaboration with other providers/databases and directly with end users in biology and computational fields; probably more importantly because we made the data available to the wider community, many researchers picked up our data and used it independently (although that can be harder to track).</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>NASCarrays</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The NASC germplasm database holds data on just under 1 million stocks that have been acquired since the centre began in 1990/91. We replaced the Arabidopsis Information Service in Germany (1964 - 1987) and acquired all 200+ stocks from them. In 1999 this was increased to 20,000 and in 2013 passed the 800,000 mark. We hold genomic, genetic, phenotypic, passport, collection, images, and other sundry data about these stocks and make this information freely available to researchers and collaborators worldwide. As part of the database we run a cost-recovery catalogue for ordering stocks which includes user data and a fully developed e-commerce solution bespoke to NASC. We also integrate our data with exteral and internal databases using a variety of mathods from direct data exchange through dynamic URLs to fully fledged Web Services (SOAP and REST).</gtr:description><gtr:id>B4F4DA76-7027-4F14-BAE1-570B737BF3C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This database underpins the distribution of arabidopsis germplasm resources to the UK and European plant community.

We took the data from our http://ukcrop.net database (AceDB format) and integrated it with new genomics/sequencing data. We added data from our Germplasm activities and over time added NASCarrays and other available datasets. To this end we were the first genome browser of any species in the world to integrate genome data with stock ordering and transcriptome data. We also included early SNP data from primitive arrayseq and were consequently the most richly populated genome browser of any species for many years. Some current browsers still do not have this richness of function and almost all other species browsers are not at the point that we were when we officially closed the database.

Increased computational skills in the community had led to an inevitable international proliferation of browsers; several of them using our freely available data. Our efforts, and the efforts of our collaborators at TAIR/ABRC to make access to our services as open and exploitable as possible helped to make the proliferation of browsers and analysis tools at multiple sites possible and attractive and develop the current community options. 

We officially closed the database at failed renewal of funding (lack of uniqueness). A snapshot is still available at the old URL as per 'good practice' but is not actively linked from our other resources to ensure data quality/currency.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B94403D6-F246-4E65-9B9A-0A1CD93BEA4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>When we were unique, we were a critical point in supporting the community with an integrated seed/genome/array data browser. The first generation of Gramene's arabidopsis data and the EBIs own arabidopsis plant-ensembl database were directly derived from and attributed to us. After the proliferation of competing browsers led to a perception by the funding committee that we were not unique and should concentrate on our core (unique in Europe) remit of germplasm distribution; we dropped our browser and integrated with the prevailing providers. Throughout this process and during our own development, we always made our data freely and openly available to others (collaborators or competitors) in he community and therefore were instrumental in catalysing a range of current bioinformatics browser systems for plants (e.g. AIP).</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>atensembl</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of
