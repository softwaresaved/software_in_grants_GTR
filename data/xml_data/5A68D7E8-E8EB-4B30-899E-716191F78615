NK cells are able to detect cancerous and infected cells by expressing on their surface specialized molecules known as receptors. These receptors are extremely unusual in that they can deliver inhibitory or activatory signals, and are expressed in a random manner such that a given receptor is only present on a proportion of NK cells. If we could understand the mechanisms responsible for this unusual pattern of expression we might be able to control the expression of the key receptors on NK cells and thereby ensure that NK cells receive the correct signals that enable them to destroy diseased cells but not healthy cells. One way of doing this would be to identify and alter the regulatory elements, called promoters, that are present in the genes of these receptors. Recently a novel promoter, called Pro1, was discovered in the vicinity of NK receptor genes. It has been suggested that Pro1 acts like an electrical switch and, depending on whether it is flicked up or down, the associated NK receptor will or will not be expressed. The aim of this project is to test this theory by altering the switch so that it is either permanently on or permanently off. If the Pro1 theory is correct, this will result in the associated NK receptor now being expressed on all NK cells or no NK cells. To do this experiment we will make a copy of the NK receptor gene and its associated Pro1 switch, use genetic engineering to make precise alterations to Pro1, then place the altered gene back into cells and look for receptor expression. The results obtained in this project are expected to provide new and important information that may eventually allow us to manipulate the receptor expression on NK cells and thereby provide better treatments for various diseases, including certain types of cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>NK [natural killer] cells play a critical role in defence against malignant and infectious disease, in certain autoimmune diseases and reproductive disorders, and in the rejection of bone marrow transplants. Their ability to recognize diseased, infected, and foreign cells is mediated by various surface receptors, in particular receptors for MHC class I molecules. A remarkable feature of NK cell class I receptors [CIRs] is that they are expressed in an unusual stochastic manner, thereby creating a highly diverse repertoire of NK cells in which, to a first approximation, each individual NK cell expresses a unique permutation of CIRs. These receptors can also be induced on T cells and may control their reactivity. A potential breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the expression of CIRs was recently provided by the discovery of a novel regulatory element, termed Pro1, located upstream of the normal transcriptional start site [Pro2] of these genes. In vitro studies indicate that Pro1 is in fact a bidirectional promoter, transcription from the forward Pro1F promoter blocking the binding of inhibitory factors near Pro2 and creating an on state, transcription from the reverse Pro1R promoter permitting the formation of an inhibitory complex at Pro2 and creating an off state. The overall objective of the work we are proposing is to rigorously test each of the key aspects of the Pro1 hypothesis in the following ways: Firstly, to use reporter constructs transfected into immature NK cells to precisely map the sites that contribute to the presence or absence of Pro1 activity in inhibitory and activatory CIR genes. Secondly, to use recombineering technology and the creation of isogenic transgenic mice by targeted mutagenesis to test whether mutations that selectively block transcription from Pro1F or Pro1R or which delete the repressor site upstream of Pro2 have the expected effect on the expression of the model inhibitory CIR, Ly49I. Thirdly, to develop a system in which targeted ES cells develop efficiently into NK cells in vitro, thereby allowing detailed in vivo analysis of the genetic factors controlling CIR gene expression but in an in vitro context, thereby greatly reducing the costs and ethical issues associated with the use of transgenic animals in studies of gene regulation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>525655</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited public lecture at the Life Science Centre</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>4CA320B2-DAC3-4BED-98F0-DEA8ACBEA95B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On each occasion 20-30 members of the public attended, and there was a great deal of interest and questions.
