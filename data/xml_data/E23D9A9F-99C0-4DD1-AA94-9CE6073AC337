This theory has since found deep connections with knot theory in topology and geometry, statistical mechanics and conformal quantum field theory. A subfactor encodes the symmetry of a statistical mechanical model or at the critical temperature a conformal quantum field theory. Dimension is ubiquitous in mathematics. The Jones index measures the relative dimension of the larger algebra over the smaller. K-theory also provides tools for understanding dimension and both of these notions are at the heart of this project.

It was thought that exotic models could be produced in the subfactor framework beyond the standard models which had underlying classical group symmetries. However producing such models proved elusive. In 1993 Uffe Haagerup produced a candidate for an exotic subfactor of irrational dimension, namely the Jones index is half of 5 plus the square root of 13 - by essentially producing the Boltzmann weights at criticality by his bare hands with strong integrability properties. However Evans and Gannon have shown that one can understand this subfactor from classical symmetries of an elementary finite group, the symmetries of three objects, and the group of orthogonal transformations in 13 dimensions, producing evidence for an underlying conformal quantum field theory to be described by a conformal net or vertex operator algebra. They have also provided evidence that the Haagerup family belongs to an infinite family and most recently found another related series of quadratic systems, with again strong evidence of underlying conformal field theories based on underlying classical symmetries.

This programme is to analyse and shed light on these mysterious subfactors and quadratic systems, the Haagerup systems and related series, thought to be infinite, the near group systems, their common generalizations as quadratic systems. The tools are from operator algebras, particularly subfactors, conformal nets and twisted equivariant K-theory. The objectives are the realization of the underlying modular tensor categories of their doubles or symmetric enveloping algebras and the recovery of the quadratic systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is in basic research and therefore the primary beneficiaries of the research are within the academic research community. This is an intradisciplinary project linking academic fields in mathematics and also within mathematical and theoretical physics, with potential impact across a wide spectrum.

The theory of operator algebras was initiated by Murray and von Neumann as a tool for studying group representations and as a framework for quantum mechanics. Since then, non commutative operator algebras have become a powerful tool in the analysis of singular topological spaces and measure spaces with links and applications in many areas of mathematics and theoretical physics - particularly K-theory, foliations, invariants of links and three manifolds, quantum groups quotient singularities, modular invariants, conformal and topological quantum field theories, random matrices, D-branes. Commutative operator algebras - namely the commutative C*-algebras of continuous functions on locally compact Hausdorff spaces or the commutative von Neumann algebras of measurable functions are inadequate for understanding singular spaces such as orbifolds with singular points or the orbit spaces of ergodic systems, or foliations. Noncommutative operator algebras and noncommutative geometry provides a rich tapestry for symmetries beyond the classical ones. 

An outer group action on a hyperfinite factor can be recovered from the position of the fixed point algebra. An inclusion of a subfactor in a factor has a rich combinatorial structure which can be described by a paragroup in the language of Ocneanu, a lambda-lattice in the language of Popa or planar algebra in the language of Jones. The theory of subfactors was initiated by Jones in 1981 who found that the minimal algebraic structure realising this quantum symmetry was the Temperley-Lieb algebra or quantum SU(2). These algebras had already appeared in the work of Temperley and Lieb in the Potts model of statistical mechanics.

Conformal field theories in two space-time dimensions are the simplest quantum field theories most accessible to mathematical study, These mathematical formulations through subfactors, algebraic quantum field theory and vertex operator algebras have had profound impact in mathematics through the work of Jones and Borcherds and many other researchers worldwide. Jones most recent subfactor framework of planar algebras has influenced work of Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko on free probability and random matrices; Borcherds' proof of the original Monstrous Moonshine conjectures; the work of Ed Frenkel et al on geometric Langlands; and the chiral de Rham complex of Malikov-Schechtman-Vaintrob, to name a few. The work of Carpi, Kawahigashi, Longo and Weiner relates conformal nets in a precise way with vertex operator algebras satisfying certain regularity or integrability. 

The current project addresses broad issues related to the mathematical foundation of conformal field theory. Atiyah wrote in the context of the Freed-Hopkins-Teleman description of the Verlinde ring as twisted equivariant K-theory :&amp;quot;The K-theory approach [to the Verlinde ring] is totally new and much more direct than most other ways. It remains to be thoroughly explored.&amp;quot; This project utilizes this mathematical framework as one of our tools in understanding the Haagerup subfactor and related siblings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>345612</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N022432/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
