It asks how this concept can be used to reimagine new means by which African-Caribbean women achieve agency through mobility in twenty-first century contexts of globalization, transnationalism and deterritorialization. Post-diaspora is neither a departure from, nor a continuation of contemporary usages of diaspora: rather the 'post' signals a new problem space that allows us to imagine new futures, by focusing on mobility both as a defining feature of Caribbean identities and as a route to self-fashioning for African-Caribbean women. Rather than linear journeys that result in the reconstitution of a remembered past in a present of new physical and cultural geographies, post-diasporic journeys are rhizomatic: they radically configure the assumed significance of 'home' and 'away'. In rhizomatic journeys, roots are provisional and unfixed. Routes are often circuitous, and return - physical, rhetorical and economic - is a key component of African-Caribbean women's mobility (Trotz 2006; Trotz and Malone 2013; Reynolds 208, 2010). 

While contemporary engagements with concepts of diaspora emphasise loss of 'origin', displacement, 'genealogies of dispossession' (Boyarin and Boyarin 2002; Cho2007), the formulation 'post-diaspora' moves away from ideas of homeland as singular and discrete, and from the accompanying idea that feelings of longing constitute the diasporic subject. As a concept, it intervenes in attempts in contemporary scholarship to progress discussions of the African diaspora beyond the privileging of nationalist sensibilities and an 'exaggerated attention to belonging' (Rushdy 2009), to more mobile and enabling articulations of blackness. It is a reimagining of affiliated identities beyond those that pertain to the nation state (Gilroy 2004, 2011; Hall 2007). Caribbean and African-Caribbean communities in North America, Britain and elsewhere are both twice diasporised (Hall 1976), and in the process of onward and recursive migrations, they are reconstituted by different and more variegated encounters (Cohen 2009). The concept of post-diaspora is attentive to the consequences of multiple encounters and the possibility of diverse affiliations. 

 This transdisciplinary Network uses knowledge and resources of five disciplinary areas: gender studies, literature, sociology, cultural geography and history. The Network also facilitates a trans-historical and transnational dialogue on the theme of post-diaspora. It connects scholars from Britain, the Caribbean and North America, who bring their own theoretical, methodological and disciplinary processes to answer the following questions: 

1. What does present research tell us about how Britain, the Caribbean and North America can be understood in post-diaspora contexts? 

2. What are the gender dimensions of post-diaspora for African Caribbean women, with its emphasis on multi-directional mobility and instability? 

3) How do these non-linear forms of mobility and the production of multiple affiliations produce the conditions for African-Caribbean women's agency and self-fashioning? 

4) What forms of expression are available to reconfigure identities as post-diasporic? 

These questions will be addressed through a website archiving the Network's activities and hosted by London South Bank University; a series of short research meetings and seminars of invited international scholars; an edited collection for a special issue of the interdisciplinary journal Small Axe and selected contributions to Diaspora: a Journal of Transnational Studies; a one-day policy dialogue between members of the Network and the International Migration Taskforce, Planning Institute of Jamaica; two creative platforms of invited practitioners whose work addresses the theme; a meeting with the curators of the Black Cultural Archives, London.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network grant supports research and dialogue on new dimensions of migration during the UN Decade for People of African Descent. It is the first step in a longer-term strategy for new research partnerships between the two collaborating institutions: London South Bank University and The University of the West Indies, Jamaica. It builds on existing links between Dr. Leith Dunn (Co-I) and policy makers at the International Migration Taskforce at the Planning Institute of Jamaica. The Network extends established relations between Dr. Suzanne Scafe (PI) and curators and archivists at the Black Cultural Archives, London, and Network member Patricia Noxolo and the Drum Intercultural Arts Centre, Birmingham. It is anticipated that further research will strengthen further these Networks to invite formal collaboration from one or more of the non-academic participating institutions. 
The Network will articulate how globalization might work for African-Caribbean women migrants, even while acknowledging and addressing its exclusions and the production of inequalities. It will address the following groups: Policy makers working on issues related to women in the African-Caribbean diaspora; not for profit/charitable organisations and the public. During the project, government policy makers at the Planning Institute, and the following beneficiaries will be engaged via public discussion panels and research seminars at the International Migration Taskforce and the Institute for Gender and Development Studies, University of the West Indies, Jamaica: 
1. HIBISCUS, an organization which helps in the rehabilitation of women drug couriers, and provides other programmes that aid women who are casualties of transnational economies. Hibiscus has an ongoing partnership with the Co-I, Dr. Dunn. During the project they will attend public discussion panels, small workshop meetings and creative performances. 
2. The Black Cultural Archives: The final meeting will bring together the curators of existing collections both at the Black Cultural Archives and at the Tower Hamlets library for a discussion about how concepts of 'belonging', central to the themes of both archived collections, can be extended through discussion with Network members and the sharing of information from archives in Jamaica such as those held at the Memory Bank of Jamaica, and the University of the West Indies.
 The online website will be the main method of communicating events and academic discussions undertaken by the Network. The website will be administered from within London South Bank's School of Arts and Creative Industries, in conjunction with the PI and Network members. The site will publicise the first call for participants for Seminar 1 in February 2017. By April 2017, it will list the full programme of events for the first meeting and the dates, locations and titles of the following 3 seminars. 
The landing page of the website will provide information on the aims of the project and a navigational guide to its content. Thereafter the website will be the main channel of communication for all academic and public events organised by the Network; it will host members' blogs, conference papers, podcasts of key presentations and other material of academic and public interest. The website will include selective links with related research projects across the transdisciplinary field: all features will ensure that materials from the research will have an impact for a year within the life of the research and inform a follow-on project. The web-site will be a means of achieving both specific impact to the research community as well as wider impact to both professional and public audiences. 
Dr. Trotz is editor of the widely-read 'In the Diaspora' column of Guyana Online and the online newspaper Stabroek News. Contributions on the Network theme from participants will be published to maximise the impact of the research area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34830</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P007163/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CB391BE-87E7-4006-A2C5-43ED9DBA773C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural and Anthrop Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A2961412-FA64-4331-A882-DA219AC99567</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social policy and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
