Often the staff teaching students statistical analysis have only rudimentary skills themselves; this typically leads to low levels of student (and staff) satisfaction with such courses. Consequently, students are discouraged from quantitative topics and skills. Thus, addressing staff skills levels is crucial to addressing the issue of poor numbers skills among undergraduates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to address this issue by adopting an integrated approach to staff training and support. It will develop and deliver two quantitative methods training courses, one for staff that have only a basic level of knowledge, thus developing core skills and the other for staff with prior training; it will focus on advanced skills. Staff will receive academic credit for their participation. In addition to the development of core skills, the project will also support staff specifically in relation to the teaching challenges presented by 'numbers' work, via teaching workshops and peer coaching.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Pedagogic Impact, Impact on Educational Policy Makers
This project will directly impact on pedagogic theory and practice in relation to the issue of poor staff training and low skills among quantitative teachers by demonstrating how to build staff skills through a 'joined up' approach to staff development. The project's findings in relation to the engagement of staff in 'peer coaching' and pedagogic knowledge exchange will also make a significant contribution to pedagogic theory and practice. The academic impact of the project will begin within the thirty six month cycle of the project and its findings will be disseminated by the end of its lifespan.

Non-Academic Impact
During the course of the project, staff will develop their personal quantitative research skills and their teaching skills in relation to delivering quantitative methods to undergraduates. Therefore this project will deliver better quantitative teachers and so should produce graduates who are quantitative skills confident. These graduates will have key transferable quantitative skills. There is a well-documented shortage of numerate and numbers-literate graduates; therefore, this project will have a national and regional (the majority of our graduates remain within the North West) economic impact by seeking to address this problem by directly generating numbers-literate graduates. This economic impact will not be seen until the end of the project's lifespan, when the first cohort graduates and as it typically takes students between 12-24 months to settle into their future career, then we cannot expect to see economic impact for 2-3 years after the project ends.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51154</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Greater Manchester Boys and Girls Clubs</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Quantitative Data Analysis Training for Voluntary Sector Organisations</gtr:description><gtr:id>F9299008-FC37-4160-B06C-BB5FE967882F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Student and tutor guidebooks; teaching dataset.

A large number of staff who currently deliver quantitative methods (QM) to undergraduates have very low level QM skills and lack confidence. This research found that staff attitudes to QM frequently mirrored those of their students. The research team developed a holistic approach to training staff, which addressed four key elements: technical proficiency in using data analysis software; conceptual understanding of key concepts; opportunities to practice skills once learnt; and the pedagogic, ie. what strategies/techniques can I use to teach this material. This holistic approach raised staff confidence levels and improved teaching within 18 months of the project's start. Such a holistic approach was also shown to be key to designing and delivering QM to undergraduates. The findings of this research have been used to upskill QM staff in HE, the secondary sector and within the voluntary sector. This research has had a direct impact on the QM training of over two thousand students, raising achievement and confidence levels.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>07CD1019-CC25-4EDA-B295-F7C2583BF578</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>To ensure that the UK's quantitative methods skill deficit is addressed, the training of staff is as important as the training of students.

This holistic approach raised staff confidence levels and improved teaching within 18 months of the project's start. The holistic approach was then used by staff in their approach to teaching students, ie, the QM modules were redesigned to incorporate the same four key elements. However, the research team discovered that in order for the staff to fully engage in the training, there needed to be incentives for staff: the team used workload recognition as a key driver. In addition, the research team worked with to modify departmental culture to make it more QM-inclusive, through a valuing QM strategy, that included embedding QM into the wider curriculum, investing in teaching infrastructure, and identifying QM as a departmental strategic priority.

The research team developed two training courses as a result of this funding; one introductory and one advanced. This has created six teaching data sets, a staff handbook, two student handbooks, and related teaching materials. These materials have since (post-modification) been used as a template for delivering staff training in QM to external agencies, including one national charity and school teachers. 
This research has directly impacted on the QM training of over two thousand students; raising pass rates, overall average grades, and satisfaction levels. One legacy of this project is the successful award of Q-Step Centre status in 2013.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research team have started to disseminate their key findings and materials to other QM teachers, both in HE, the secondary sector and beyond.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EC4CAC69-4034-4144-8F5D-E64C9C4A4ADD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C71571C9-47A0-4D18-92F8-E18BE41C7F80"><gtr:id>C71571C9-47A0-4D18-92F8-E18BE41C7F80</gtr:id><gtr:title>'I'm not a quants person'; key strategies in building competence and confidence in staff who teach quantitative research methods'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Social Research Methodology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f38a95d1d9428c33aa4a6b615209751c"><gtr:id>f38a95d1d9428c33aa4a6b615209751c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Scott Jones J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J011703/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FFA3A6C9-532B-4B83-B6F7-AAF3E63D34F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Stats., Comp. &amp; Methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
