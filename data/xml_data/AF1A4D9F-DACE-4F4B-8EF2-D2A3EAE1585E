Concerning the article on the compositional process and alterations, the questions relate mainly to assessing Dvorak's approach to the libretto and the expressive tone and structure of the opera.\n\nThe research involved has included the collection and collation of sources. The main sources consulted so far are the composer's autograph (held in the Czech Museum of Music) and the theatre score used for the premiere (held in the Prague National Theatre's archives), both of which have been digitised for the convenience of the editorial process. In addition, the surviving parts (also held by the National Theatre) have been consulted, for purposes of corroboration, and coordinated with both the autograph and theatre score as a guarantee of the definitive nature of the theatre copy. Sketch material and the composer's continuous sketch particelle (Czech Museum of Music) have been used in assessing the compositional process and occasionally to verify ambiguous readings in the score; the research undertaken here will contribute both to the introduction to the edition and the proposed article.\n\nThe preparatory work on the material outined above has already taken place including a draft of the introduction to the edition. Work on assessing the changes made to Vrchlicky's libretto by Dvorak still needs to be undertaken; the relevant material has been identified in the Czech writers' archive (Strahov) and the Dvorak collection in the Czech Museum of Music. Now that the fundamental musical material has been assembled and to a large extent assessed, support is now sought for the final process of editing the score and vocal score, and the preparation of the associated article and seminar presentation. \n\nThis is the first edition of the orchestral full score. Since its premiere the opera has only been available to scholars and performers in two publications: a sequence of eight isolated scenes published by Hudebni matice in 1921 and a vocal score, not based on Dvorak's own vocal score, prepared without substantial introduction or any critical notes by Karel Solc in 1941. Thus, the present edition will not only be the first definitive presentation of one of Dvorak's most substantial and significant operatic scores, but also the first time it has been generally available in full score for scholars and performers.\n\nThe preparation of the edition is undertaken using the protocols for editing volumes in the Dvorak complete edition developed over the last four years in consultation with a panel of international experts (see J. Gabrielova, 'The New Complete Editionof the Works of Antonin Dvorak', Muscologica Brunensia, 2006, 115-23; 'Editorial principles of the of the new complete edition of the works of Antonin Dvorak, Hudebni veda 40, 2003, 264-81 - both in Czech).The editorial board, chaired by Jarmila Gabrielova (head of the musicology departments of the Czech Academy of Sciences and the Charles Universty), includes the present applicant and Drs Klaus Doge, senior editor of the Wagner complete edition (Schott) and Daniela Philippi, senior editor of the Gluck complete edition (Barenreiter). Members of the board offer support and scrutiny during the editorial process. To facilitate the editing process, the Czech Academy of Sciences has supported the transcription of Dvorak's autograph into electronic notation. Extended leave, if granted, will enable the completion of the editing process by the end of June 2008.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41224</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0601BB25-510D-4B34-85E2-74C5E391A751"><gtr:id>0601BB25-510D-4B34-85E2-74C5E391A751</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Dvorak, his librettists and the working libretto of Armida'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/81666f78fcf09aa0d412d1640495e04e"><gtr:id>81666f78fcf09aa0d412d1640495e04e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jan Smaczny (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/70982BBF-7E4E-4793-804A-2EFA132F0AE3"><gtr:id>70982BBF-7E4E-4793-804A-2EFA132F0AE3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dvorak's working libretto of Armida</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/81666f78fcf09aa0d412d1640495e04e"><gtr:id>81666f78fcf09aa0d412d1640495e04e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jan Smaczny (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F014767/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47D79871-3D9E-42F7-83E1-354D081901C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
