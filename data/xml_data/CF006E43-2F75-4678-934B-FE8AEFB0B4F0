In regulatory contexts a demand for informed consent is seen as the expression of respect for individual autonomy. The principle of autonomy, although fundamental, is itself to be balanced against other fundamental normative principles. Aside from difficulties in the application of general principles to particular cases, and of balancing distinct moral principles, it is unclear why individual autonomy should be so dominant.\n\nWhy, and in what contexts, is the individual so important that his or her consent can determine what is permissible\n\nHow should we understand the significance of individual consent in cultural contexts where the collective plays a much greater role? \n\nHow can individuals process and understand the information required of them in those complex decisional contexts, where consent is required? \n\nWhy would it not be rational for individuals to place their trust in professionals? \n\nWhat is the basis for the assumption that many human interactions place an obligation upon certain parties to inform others of their intentions?\n\nIn these two workshops on The Future of Consent internationally renowned academics will have the opportunity to examine issues at the heart of contemporary moral, legal and political philosophy surrounding the importance accorded to consent and individual autonomy. Those present at these workshops will offer contrasting views on autonomy and informed consent. Some see infomed consent as no longer being of central importance. Some think it retains its importance but that it is crucial to think afresh about what it means and what it requires. \n\nThis international group of scholars represent the disciplines of philosophy, psychology, and medical law and represent fourteen universities from the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. \n\nIt is intended that selected papers from these workshops will comprise the collection provisionally entitled 'The Future of Consent', to be edited by the PI and Co-Investigator. \n\nAcademics and professionals from all relevant disciplines will be made aware of and encouraged to attend these workshops. It is intended that there will be two workshops. The first (September 2009) in China will be attended by key participants from the UK and the US and a number of invited respondents from Chinese philosophy, its location will ensure a high attendance from Chinese scholars and researchers. It will address the normative question of whether respect for individual autonomy has global appeal and application. The second workshop will be in the United Kingdom in April 2010. Its principal focus will be the challenges to autonomy from psychology, law and medicine, but will include a final roundtable session with the aim of summarizing the debates, identifying and clarifying key themes, and highlighting topics for future research and collaboration.\n\nThe contributors to the project comprise: \n\nProfessor Gerald Dworkin (UC Davis) \nProfessor Onora O'Neill (Cambridge)\nProfessor Allen Buchanan (Duke)\nProfessor Margot Brazier (Manchester)\nProfessor P.S.
