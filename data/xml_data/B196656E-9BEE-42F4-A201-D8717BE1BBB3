&lt;p>The Lighthouse is a voluntary organisation based at an 'interface' area in North Belfast (a site with on-going inter and intra-community violence) which provides support for people affected by suicide. Studies show that suicide is prevalent in the area, especially among middle-aged males amid the continuing social and political tensions associated with the protracted Peace Process, poverty and the loss of traditional status among working class males.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is a long history of community-based drama projects in Belfast, but the use of interactive applied drama techniques is less well developed. The Lighthouse is well established in the city as a vital resource for people in extreme need, but they welcome the opportunity to extend their range of working methods to include drama.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The proposal therefore aims to connect this need with academics (Dr D. Grant and Prof. P. Shirlow) and other practitioners.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit:

Participants in the drama workshops - between 15 and 20 men and women who are Lighthouse service-users

Staff and volunteers and the Lighthouse

The participating researchers at Queen's, including the Research Assistant/Facilitator, and colleagues and students in the university working in the fields of both social science and applied arts

Members of the families of service-users and the wider community who attend interactive performance events


How will they benefit:

The service-users will be introduced to new ways of exploring issues through drama that are important to them in relation to mental health and their wider lives. Their work will be facilitated rather than directed, allowing them signficant input into the design, delivery and dissemination of their own work (as has already been demonstrated in the pilot project, which by their own accounts allowed them to share difficult issues with others in an accessible way).

Staff and Volunteers will have the opportunity to engage in a process of experiential learning and to acquire new sklills and insights relating to the applied drama method.

The research team will have access to professional &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; expertise and direct feedback from colleagues in the voluntary sector and service-users to enable them to evaluate and refine their own practice.

Members of the wider community associated with the Lighthouse will be able to learn more of the work of the organisation and to share in the creative work of the workshop participants.

The main output was a performance addressing the importance of peer support for men with mental health issues. A relationship emerged between the image theatre techniques used in workshops and a paralleled photography project. The visibility of the project through live performances and related media coverage led to connections being made with intra and inter-community groups, youth, academics, practitioners and politicians. 

The impact of the drama project was closely linked to a range of inter-related resources and activities such as training programmes and lobbying activities run by the Lighthouse Centre, which created a rich and fertile environment for effective exploitation of the drama-based work. The specific impacts of the drama programme are to be understood in the wider context of direct and indirect personal and community development/awareness.

DIRECT

? The opportunity collaboratively to explore issues and ideas around mental health (&amp;quot;Nobody in this district talked about suicide at any time. The play brought it into the open, let people sort of face it.&amp;quot;)

? Enhanced social interaction and agency within and beyond the participants

? Enhanced confidence and ability to share and express ideas (&amp;quot;I've more confidence and a bit more willingness to try anything&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Feeling better about yourself and doing more things&amp;quot;.)

? Recognition of the success of the project which gave the group a sense of authority to stand up to other influential organisations within the community (e.g. paramilitaries) &amp;quot;They recognise that we are able to stand up to them, face them, so they do. But ex-members of paramilitary groups are saying well done, we should have been doing this years ago.&amp;quot;

? Participation in the play had led to a much wider engagement in cultural, educational and social activities. (&amp;quot;Most of us have done our catering courses, food and hygiene.&amp;quot;)

INDIRECT

? Participants reported that the play stimulated conversations and approaches from community members in relation to mental health issues. The project had a positive distributive effect in that it signalled the participants as a resource in which to disclose, confide and seek help. The men understood that they were not experts in mental health but guides who directed individuals to mental health service providers. (&amp;quot;We can put them onto people. A wee go between&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;People open up more with people from their own community and they'd see the work we've done doing voluntary work in the community centre and all. They do find it easier to talk to people in their own centres now, than outsiders&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;The more knowledge you have the more you can give out to other people.&amp;quot;)

? One participant attributed enhanced employment prospects due to his involvement in the play

? Participants spoke of healthier form of social interaction and engagement (&amp;quot;Before I joined that men's group I rarely left the house. Now we're seeing plays and looking for other things&amp;quot;).

? Attendance at events at Queen's University had encouraged group members to seek out other accessible events such as free live broadcasts at the BBC.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>On an individual level, participants have begun to engage more actively with their immediate and wider communities, and as a group are now seen as a resource for both their own neighbourhood and for the Lighthouse. They regularly receive requests to perform their work in a variety of community contexts. Plans are being developed for a theatre production that would celebrate, but also critique the history of their area (Tiger's Bay) which has both a proud and often problematic reputation. The value of drama as a vehicle for exploring mental health issues is now understood better by the Lighthouse organisation, and the potential for dialogue between different arts interventions (e.g. photography) has added an exciting additional dimension to work. It is anticipated that more members will be attracted to the men's group and that the proposed theatre production will allow further links to be made with groups such as the Jennymount Youth Group and musical groups already based in Duncairn Arts Centre. This should serve to broaden the impact of the work in terms of both age and gender. There has also been some discussion of developing the work on a more cross-community basis with visits to venues in Catholic/Nationalist areas. The project team aim to write two academic papers. Paper 1 (Research in Drama and Education) will examine the cumulative impact of the project upon self-esteem, communicative ability, self-understanding and more reflexive attitudes to life stressors is positioned. It will evaluate manner in which theatre techniques depended and extended participants of the characters and themes they encountered. It will also analyse the impact of life-size paper puppet in terms of stimulating additional resource, and the groups experiences of improvisation and impact upon emotional intensity. 

A second paper (Journal of Arts and Communities) will evaluate the impact of the drama project as linked to a range of inter-related resources and activities such as training programmes and lobbying activities run by the Lighthouse Centre itself, which created a rich and fertile environment for effective exploitation of the drama-based work. This will relate to the context of agency and identification among the men who participated within the group. The specific impacts of the drama programme interpreted with regard to how drama based approaches stimulate qualitative-influenced and more appreciative understandings of mental health. 

In late 2014/2015 2015 Professor Shirlow via the Institute for the Study of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice will be hosting an academic/practitioners workshop on mental health needs, linked to OFMDFM funding in Northern Ireland. This will include participants from Notre Dame, Queen's University Belfast and University of Ulster. The research findings will form a workshop related to drama, agency and mental health. 

Professor Shirlow via funding from the British Embassy in Moldova will be undertaking in April 2014 a 4 day tour of presentations at Moldovan universities. The applied drama and metal health project findings will form part of his presentation entitled 'Northern Ireland: From the Intractable to the Negotiable?'</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>45EE86E8-88C1-4F30-965A-547CE7D2E826</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Mental Health Needs</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FAC9817F-3A72-4B2D-94BF-EC580415D23F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lighthouse in terms of the projects findings and framework are now more conversant with the link between mental health need and the ability and impact of applied drama to challenge the symptoms of trauma and other conflict related emotional issues.
