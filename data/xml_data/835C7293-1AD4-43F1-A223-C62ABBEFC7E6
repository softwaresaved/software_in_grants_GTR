1) The research councils who advise on and implement government policy in relation to research funding:

For these groups, encouragement of interdisciplinary research is a major challenge; identifying and removing any obstacles to such research, and indeed identifying how such research is successfully carried out, would facilitate interdisciplinary endeavours. Our project will not do everything that would be needed to meet this aim but it will establish ways of working with interdisciplinary discourse that will be the foundation of future studies. Our research will inform the funding councils on the following questions: how easy do researchers in different disciplines find it to build on each others' work in carrying out their own? in an interdisciplinary field, of which Environmental Change is an example, to what extent are there differences in terminology (especially words and phrases which are the same in form but different in meaning) that are likely to cause problems of understanding? are the styles of papers written from the different disciplines similar enough to escape comment or different enough to cause problems of interpretation? what kind of training might researchers in the constituent disciplines of a novel interdisciplinary field need in order to facilitate cooperation? More importantly, perhaps, we will test our methods for answering these questions so that they can be applied to other interdisciplinary fields.

2) People involved in the publication of interdisciplinary research output, directly and indirectly:

These include commercial publishers (such as Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Taylor and Francis) and the large numbers of researchers that act as editors, editorial board members and reviewers. More specifically, within these operations, the findings will interest: company staff with responsibility for managing IDR journals; the editors and the editorial boards; and the staff who assist in the provision of training and writing support to authors. The findings can inform editorial and publisher policy decisions, review processes and the guidance provided to authors.

3) Those involved in conducting or managing IDR, within academia and in commercial research centres:

Researchers who are entering IDR environments may not be aware of the communication challenges faced in IDR; the description of the features of ID discourse will help them to understand what the rhetorical demands of writing for a broader audience are. Similarly, managers of IDR activities, whether at a local project team level, or at the research centre level, will benefit from the answers that we provide regarding training needs, and the possible obstacles to effective communication.

4) Teachers of Study Skills and English for Academic Purposes (EAP), many of whom work in service units within universities and prepare students particularly for postgraduate study and research:

A large proportion of their 'clients' are international students, who bring in substantial income to the UK as a whole, and upon whom the economic health of the Higher Education sector increasingly depends. In many cases, such students report that their work is interdisciplinary in scope and, furthermore, that they can experience difficulties meeting the demands of supervisors from different disciplines. EAP teachers make use of extant research into 'academic prose' in general and into the language and discourse of specific disciplines - this leaves them ill-prepared to respond to the needs of students undertaking interdisciplinary research. Our project will inform EAP and Study Skills teachers on the following question: what are the typical linguistic features and rhetorical practices of interdisciplinary research discourse?</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>384217</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Elsevier</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Elsevier UK</gtr:department><gtr:description>Partnership with Elsevier UK</gtr:description><gtr:id>181A8BF7-53FF-42CC-8196-5720D33261DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A booklet on 'Preparing to write for an interdisciplinary journal: Understanding the needs of your multidisciplinary audience' has been prepared for publication on Elsevier's PublishingCampus website (https://www.publishingcampus.elsevier.com/).</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners have given us full access to the holdings of eleven journals, and have worked with us to select the journals using confidential data from their database, and they have also conducted analyses of their citation data, as part of the overall research design.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are providing the partner with linguistic analyses of the holdings of eleven of their journals and findings that can be used in management and development of their research journals, and in providing guidance to authors and editors.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Final seminar on ESRC project (BIRDS)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0DA4C480-FE62-4865-8D9B-091DBA637AB0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research team gave talks on all aspects of the project in a series of short presentations, and the event concluded with a 45 minute plenary discussion of the implications of the research and the methods employed.

This has been published on the Elsevier PublishingCampus website (URL for document: http://tinyurl.com/jt2hjqb), and is aimed at researchers worldwide who are writing their first or second paper for an interdisciplinary audience. PublishingCampus has 60,000+ registrants with 37% returning traffic. The content of the booklet is built around the findings of the project.

The booklet was published this month (October) and it is too early to quantify impact. Impact will be assessed in the coming years by collecting data on the number of times the materials are accessed and by gathering, with the help of Elsevier, information about how useful the guidance has proved to be, through surveys and interviews.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B0F9FCD5-BEFB-4527-8520-ECB379C206FD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project used innovative methodologies to investigate the language of an interdisciplinary research journal (Global Environmental Change) over two decades, in the context of a larger set of five monodisciplinary and five further interdisciplinary journals. We wished to know how researchers write for an interdisciplinary audience, and how linguistic methods could be adapted to investigate the discourse of interdisciplinary research. 

There are four key findings from the research: two relating to the nature of interdisciplinary research discourse and two relating to methodology.

The comparison through computational analysis of 53 linguistic features in the eleven selected journals demonstrated that the ID journals cannot be simply distinguished from the MD ones using linguistic features. That is, the ID journals do not form a distinctive cluster; there is no consistent interdisciplinary 'style'. One implication of this is that there may be different 'flavours' of interdisciplinary writing. There is variation between journals (tested through random forests analysis which showed that our method predicted the assignment of articles to journals with 70% accuracy) but also within journals. The consistency of journal style ranged from below 40% to above 80%.

There is evidence, however, from the corpus analysis and also from the interview data that writing for an interdisciplinary audience requires more space (longer articles) in order to make assumptions, concepts and approaches clearer for a broader audience. Writing for an interdisciplinary audience typically contains more explanation and more 'signposting'. The interdisciplinary journal writer enacts two complementary positions: how the approach they take offers a new perspective to other disciplines (divergence); and how it simultaneously contributes to a shared enterprise (convergence).

The project demonstrated that it is possible to adapt an existing methodology (Multi-Dimensional Analysis) to identify dimensions that are specific to a specialised corpus and, using those dimensions, to identify 'constellations' of papers that are distinctive in their dimensional profile. Six constellations were identified in Global Environmental Change, each representing a distinctive epistemological take on a common research challenge. Our research suggests, however, that the MDA model could be improved by adjusting the set of linguistic features that the analysis uses and we recommend this as a path for future research work.

The project also discovered and demonstrated the value of the technique known as topic modelling to explore topics not only in individual texts but also in text-parts (through an automated slicing technique). This analysis provides an overview of the content of a corpus, encapsulating the content and positioning of a large number of texts. It indicates how topics change or remain constant over time, and also how different articles may differ from or resemble each other. The method is linguistically simple but provides rich information on large collections of text, and on text structure. Our approach to topic-modelling will be of interest to a range of researchers, including those interested in text and data mining, and in corpus and computational linguistics.

The project focused on journals related to the environment, and further research needs to be conducted on interdisciplinary research in other areas. There is also room for further development of the two methodologies, using different datasets.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have implications for the ways that interdisciplinary research funding bids are assessed. One implication is that more space is needed for elaboration of ideas for a broad audience in funding applications, and for demonstrating how the partners complement each other; concomitantly, it is advisable to ask interdisciplinary teams to provide sections of text written for specialist audiences which would show the strength of each partner within the interdisciplinary team. We are interested in working with RCUK on recommendations for new application procedures.

The findings can be used by publishers, by interdisciplinary team managers and by writing tutors who support writers preparing to write for interdisciplinary researcher audiences so that they can understand the particularities of the rhetorical demands, and the linguistic strategies available to them for making their research accessible.

The new multidimensional model needs to be tested and refined on other research article datasets. Diachronic MD analyses can indicate to editors and publishers how balanced the mixture of disciplines within the journal is, and this can feed into editorial policy decisions. The potential of topic modelling in analysing journal content datasets needs to be explored and exploited too, to identify the expansion and recession of research themes, of emerging concepts and techniques, and to assist in data mining projects.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1F80E7D2-58F8-4931-803E-E08571C5C593</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://idrd-bham.info/idrd/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a six dimension multi-dimensional analysis model, based on Biber's 1985 approach to MDA but where his framework described the dimensions of general language use, our model addresses the discourse of published research articles.
