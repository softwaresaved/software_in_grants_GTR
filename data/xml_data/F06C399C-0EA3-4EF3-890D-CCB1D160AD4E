It is concerned with the roles that non-human objects play in human actions and relationships. We employ the term 'legal materiality' to emphasise that legality is not a determined status, but that legal power varies depending on law's specific techniques of representation, media and institutional settings. Such a materialist approach asks how material elements in legal processes, such as images or software, influence the persuasiveness of evidence or classify certain individuals into target populations. Moreover, a new materialist approach towards law explores the multiple ways in which law acts on different matters across society. Law becomes material by exerting tangible and corporeal effects, such as on the bodies of women, the ill, prisoners or refugees.

Such a legal materialist approach entails the view that a full picture of legality is not to be found in legal doctrines and their textual interpretation, but across different objects in society. This calls for supplementing existing approaches to law. For example, a legal materialist approach provides a more insightful analysis of the 2017 executive order issued by the American president that sought to temporarily suspend travel of individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Whereas a doctrinal approach addresses the constitutional basis of the order and its interpretation by the judiciary, the lens of legal materiality places this text in the context of its material genesis, mediation and tangible effects: from the placing of words in the order, to the inscription of the president's signature on paper, to its digital dissemination through social media platforms, to biopolitical effects on targeted individual bodies and their ability to move across space. A legal materialist lens would expose the concrete genesis, media shifts, and the differential effects on targeted groups of population of the legal instrument in full. Understanding the meaning and effects of these steps requires critical analysis, drawing upon expertise from the humanities and interpretive social sciences, as well as a sensibility for the specific properties of legal matters: paper, social media platforms, border spaces, and human bodies.

To facilitate such interdisciplinary analysis of law's social and cultural effects, we will create a new network of scholars working on legal materiality. The central aim of the network is to build a novel platform for exploring the relationships between legal processes and human and non-human entities. The network will bring people from different traditions in the arts and humanities (including law, history, literature, anthropology, media and science studies) who are working on aspects of law and new materialisms, together with artists and policy actors, to develop novel research approaches. The network will address a range of questions, such as: how do texts and interpretive practices relate to objects, bodies and spaces?; What are the implications of actor network theory and other new materialist approaches for legal scholarship? What are their limitations?; What resources can be drawn from the humanities, the interpretive social sciences and artistic communities to better understand the effects of new technological developments in law?

Activities comprise four events, beginning with a cross-disciplinary event and culminating with an international conference. We will foster deliberative public engagement and exchange in the second public event that will bring into conversation academics, artists and activists who have worked on law's material forces, particularly digital surveillance and privacy. Through open exchange and dissemination, network participants will shape research agendas on law's effects within and beyond the academy. It will lay the groundwork for a new approach to law.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The section 'Academic Beneficiaries' details the anticipated academic impact of the proposed work. Beyond shaping how the legal field is researched and taught, the legal materialities network will generate impact by providing a forum and a unique resource for informed theoretical exchange and methodological exploration of why and how law matters for non-academic practitioners in the arts, humanities and law.

Legal practitioners and policy actors, particularly in the field of international legal policy making and intellectual property, will benefit from this interdisciplinary research network by gaining a more nuanced and multi-disciplinary understanding of the ways in which their legal fields operate. Of the committed participants who will be invited as speakers to events, we will benefit from existing policy links and networks with United Nations (Sullivan), advocates for Canadian prison reform (Murray), transitional justice and truth commission proponents (Antaki), indigenous rights activists (Bhandar), U.S. based legal practitioners (Gordon), and environmental advocates (Otomo). Insights from anthropology, literature and media studies will enable different perspectives on the importance of legal material techniques, such as lists, filings and softwares in the construction of legal categories (Krajewski, Johns, M'Charek, Rouvroy). These insights will feed into policy practice by offering alternative tools for reflecting on what legal texts and traditional interpretive practices can and cannot do.

The network will create a lasting and useful impact to members of the creative arts, such as artists, filmmakers and curators, who have been engaging with the often problematic forces of law that become manifested in concrete issues, such as privacy and surveillance, ownership of information, and access to knowledge. These problems require understanding the ways in which intangible information becomes represented by distinct legal language, how it is materialised within and beyond the legal field, and its concrete, tangible effects within society. The network will open a space for artists, journalists, activists and wider publics to interact with a group of interdisciplinary academics investigating the materiality of law. We have successfully secured the participation of the American National Endowment of the Arts Poet Laureat (Hu) in the network, who has worked on the material history of the cloud and will be in dialogue with artists (Norfolk, Paglen, Poitras) and academics (Murray, Weizmann) working on digital surveillance in the second public outreach event. This is planned be held in the Tate Modern, facilitated by our confirmed network member (MacKenzie) who is a Tate Exchange Associate. The proposed network will therefore generate a lively intellectual space for encouraging the open exchange and development of ideas between communities of academics, policy actors, artists and publics who are rarely engaged in dialogue with each other. 

In addition to academic outputs, we will produce and disseminate materials that will prolong the network's impact and ensure a lasting legacy. In summary, we will: 1) create a project website for publicity and exchange of the network, including blogs and podcasts of conferences, as well as a resource page for teaching and research; 2) produce a project website, and publicise our network events in our own existing networks, including a social media platform of over 3,000 legal practitioners and scholars; 3) author a final accessible report for further dissemination through the network website, news outlets (Guardian), social media; 4) submit a commentary to a high circulation art journal to engage the artistic community, such as Art Forum, frieze or Kunstforum; and 5) document our public engagement event in video recordings through the project website.
