cross-national comparison</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K00817X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>It is a much commented upon fact that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to do well at school, go to university and obtain a well-paid, professional job than their more advantaged peers. Policymakers have shown particular interest in the lessons that England can learn from other countries about how this might be achieved. For instance, the Deputy Prime Minister (Nick Clegg), Secretary of State for Education (Michael Gove) and Leader of the Opposition (Ed Miliband) all recently spoke about how disadvantaged young people in Australia and Canada have much better prospects in life than those in England and the United States (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suttontrust.com/research/social-mobility-summit-research-findings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://www.suttontrust.com/research/social-mobility-summit-research-findings/&lt;/a>). For England to become a fairer and more cohesive society, it is vital that we understand why this is the case; are there certain things other countries are doing to help poor children that we are not?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project shall examine how family background shapes later lifetime outcomes across a range of developed countries, using new data on over 100,000 individuals from more than 20 industrialised nations.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Three broad (non-academic) groups will benefit from this work:

1. Public and Third sector organisations

Government departments, think-tanks and charities have all shown interest in academic research into socio-economic inequalities, including how Britain compares to other industrialized nations in this respect. This project will therefore be of interest to:

i. The Department for Education 
ii. Cabinet Office 
iii. Department for Business, Innovation and Skills 
iv. Office for Fair Access 
v. The Sutton Trust 
vi. The Social Mobility Foundation 
vii. The Pearson Think Tank 
viii. The Fabian Society 
ix. Civitas 
x. Centre Forum 
xi. New Economics Foundation 

The first strand of the project attempts to clarify the 'big picture' of how the link between family background, labour market skills and earnings compares in the UK to other developed countries. Claims that such associations are particularly strong in Britain have grabbed the attention of many of the above groups - yet the robustness of the existing evidence remains a controversial issue (Gorrard 2008, Saunders 2012). By producing new insight into this matter, I hope to provide a more stable foundation upon which public policy can be reliably based. This will clearly benefit policymakers within government departments, while also providing direction for charities and think-tanks in their own research. 

Academics are also making very different recommendations to policymakers as to how intergenerational inequalities can be reduced. Whereas some promote early intervention in order to raise scholastic achievement (Chowdry et al 2012, Cunha et al 2006) others suggest that intervention later in life (e.g. financial support to complete higher education) may be more effective (Jackson et al 2007). The project's second research strand will offer new insight into this important issue. This will benefit the aforementioned groups by helping them understand the role school achievement plays in generating socio-economic inequalities, and whether this factor is more important in the UK than other developed nations (and thus why intergenerational associations may be stronger here than elsewhere). 

Finally, despite the interest of research users in quantitative cross-national studies, the strengths and limitations of this approach remain poorly understood. The above groups will therefore benefit by developing a better understanding of cross-national research, and its use in public policy, via my specially designed training course.


2. The general public 

Youth unemployment, access to higher education and the life chances of young people from disadvantaged homes are topics of great public concern. The project will benefit the general public by building awareness of these issues, and whether they really are bigger problems in the UK than other developed countries. Evidence produced as part of the second strand will have particular relevance for young people who are currently in school and making significant educational and labour market decisions. It is hoped that the project will help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds understand how important achievement in secondary school is for their prospects in later life.

3. International organisations

Since 2000, the OECD has implemented the highly respected PISA study - a cross-national investigation of 15 year olds academic ability. The OECD has previously shown interest in developing PISA into a panel study of youth transitions (see www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/projekte/catewe/workshop/Report.doc). Discussions continue about including a longitudinal component in future PISA waves. The second strand of this project will benefit the OECD by highlighting the interesting questions that could be addressed if PISA were developed into a panel study, and the potential impact this could have upon government officials and public policy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>224445</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Center Forum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Centre Forum</gtr:description><gtr:id>F061A810-D67E-483B-86CC-2F8731584D95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Discussions around joint dissemination opportunities and events.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Centre Forum are interested in international comparisons of educational attainment, and how the UK compares to other countries.

For instance, the meetings that I have had with various groups (e.g. Department for Education, British Educational Research Association, Education Endowment Foundation, Early Intervention Foundation) have either helped people to understand the results from cross-national comparisons (either based upon my own work of those of others) and the caveats that need to be placed around the results. 

Another way my work has helped research practice is through sharing my expertise with government and third sector groups, such as Ofqual, the Department for Education, the Education Endowment Foundation and the Early Intervention Foundation. In many ways this impact has been through an indirect pathways, and has resulted from my willingness to share the knowledge, skills and expertise that I have developed during this grant with external organisations. A key lesson is that skills development has been a critical element of me being able to achieve research impact, and to be able to have a positive influence on wider society. Indeed, I have found that by being able (and willing) to share my knowledge and expertise of quantitative methodologies with external stakeholders, I have been able to make a valuable contribution to their work.

The major challenges with achieving research impact is that, in many ways, it has occurred somewhat independently from the specific pieces of underlying research. Although government and third sector groups have found the academic papers produced in this project interesting and insightful, the greater benefits (in terms of non-academic impact) have stemmed from the engagement activities I have undertaken that were spillovers from this. In other words, via the stakeholder and engagement events I have organised and spoken at, I have made a number of contacts at organisations who I have followed up with (e.g. the OECD, EiF, EEF, DfE, Open Society). It is then by me working with these organisations, and helping them think through their own issues of current interest, where the greatest non-academic benefits have results.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5643CC22-7D41-4904-868A-54EF0FB15ADD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Strand 1: Family background, labour market skills and earnings
How does intergenerational mobility compare in the UK to other countries?
? The UK is ranked 19th out of 37 countries in terms of the strength of the relationship between family background and later lifetime income. It is broadly similar to a number of other OECD countries in this respect (including France, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Japan).
? Consistent with the intergenerational income mobility literature, family background seems to be a greater barrier to future economic success in Britain than in Scandinavia, Canada a handful of central European countries (Germany, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands). 
? On the other hand, intergenerational associations are weaker in the UK than in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania) and the United States.
? The UK does stand out internationally in terms of the link between family background and low pay. Out of the 27 countries considered, only seven (mostly Eastern European) countries had a stronger association than in the UK.

How robust is the methodology used in cross-national comparisons of income mobility?

? One of the key methods (Two Sample Two Stage Least Squares - TSTSLS) economists often use in comparisons of income mobility across countries are subject to large and systematic bias.
? When using this methodology, the most commonly reported measure of income mobility (the intergenerational elasticity) is usually overestimated. In contrast, another (less frequently reported) measure of income mobility (the intergenerational correlation) tends to be downwardly bias when estimated using TSTSLS.
? Although often cited by policymakers, cross-national comparisons of 'social' (income) mobility are subject to a great deal of uncertainty (due to the data limitations discussed in this paper). Hence such comparisons should be interpreted with care.

Is there a link between income inequality, educational attainment and intergenerational mobility at the international level?
? The cross-national link between income inequality and intergenerational mobility (often known as the 'Great Gatsby Curve') can be replicated using alternative measures of intergenerational mobility and cross-nationally comparable data. The strength of the association depends, however, upon whether former Communist countries in economic transition are included.
? In all countries, it is educational attainment that is driving the link between parental education and offspring's earnings.
? There is a strong association between income inequality and both the direct and indirect effect of parental education on offspring's earnings.
? Although income inequality is associated with both access to education and its financial returns, the strength of the relationship seems to be greater for the former than the latter. This suggests that the intergenerational correlation of education may be the more important driver of the link between income inequality and the 'through education' component of mobility.
? The fact that the association between parental education, offspring's education and offspring's earnings varies by income inequality suggests that financial resources play an important role in the intergenerational transmission of advantage.
? High inequality countries have more private investment in education and less public investment. This further emphasises the important role of financial resources in the transmission of advantage in countries with greater inequality. 

Strand 2: Family background and youth transitions across Anglophone countries

Parental education, household income and entry into post-secondary education
? Parental education gradients in access to university are large in four English-speaking countries (Australia, Canada, England and the United States).
? Household income is also associated with access to university in each of these countries. However, after conditioning upon secondary school achievement, the relationship with income almost completely goes. This holds true within all four countries. This suggests it is not low income per se that limits disadvantaged children's access to university in these countries. Rather it is low school achievement, and factors (other than income) related to parental education, that is leading to their low post-secondary participation rates.
? In Australia, England and the United States, children with low education parents are no less likely to enter university than children with 'averagely' educated parents (conditional upon academic skills measured at age 15). Yet children with 'high' education parents continue to have a significant advantage relative to both these groups.
? Hence policy discussion about university access should focus upon closing the gap between the most advantaged in society and the majority of the population, rather than concentrating upon only the lowest socio-economic groups. 

The link between family background and access to high status universities
? There are large socio-economic differences in access to elite universities in Australia, England and the United States.
? Although academic achievement in secondary school makes an important contribution to family background differences in elite university access, other factors also play a key role.
? Conditional upon secondary school academic achievement, the socio-economic gradient in elite university access is very similar across these three countries.
? There is, however, a notable difference in the United States between access to elite public sector universities and elite private sector universities. After controlling for academic achievement in secondary school, family background matters significantly more for access to the former than for the latter. 

The link between private schooling, continuation into post-secondary education and early labour market outcomes
? Private school pupils are more likely to enter university, attend a high-status institution and work in a professional job than their state school peers. This holds true across Australia, England and the United States.
? Only around half this difference is due to 'sorting' effects (in each of the three countries). The other half is mainly due to higher levels of academic achievement in secondary school - though other 'unexplained' factors also pay an important role.
? Similar broad patterns (in terms of explaining the private school advantage) hold across Australia, England and the United States.
? The magnitude of the private school advantage that is not explained by either social selection or higher school attainment is very similar across these thee English-speaking countries. 


What were the most significant achievements?
? Producing five academic journal papers and one book chapter. These articles span across social science disciplines (education, economics, sociology) and have been published in leading international journals including Social Forces and Higher Education.
? Completing a secondment at the OECD. This enabled me to form international networks, and also showcase my research on the world stage.
? Being able to disseminate evidence from my research into government and third sector organisations. This includes giving evidence as part of the Education Select Committee inquiry into working class educational disadvantage, and being a key note speaker at the Sutton Trust conference on improving access to university.
? The formation of international collaborative partnerships and establishment of a formal international network. During the funding period I have collaborated on projects with other early-career researchers from Spain, Australia, Canada and the United States. Together we have now established a group of scholars who specialise in international comparisons of educational attainment and youth transitions.
? Receipt of co-funding to disseminate my work from various groups, including the OECD, Open Society Foundation, Jacobs Foundation and the British Academy.

To what extent were the grant objectives met?
In my original proposal I set out the following ten objectives. I discuss below how these have been met during the funding period (and, where applicable, where these objectives have only partially been met):
1. To provide clarity as to how the association between family background and average earnings compares in the UK to other OECD countries.

This objective has been met. As part of the fellowship I have written a paper comparing the link between family background and labour market earnings in the UK to more than 30 other countries. This was published in 2015 by the journal Fiscal Studies.

2. To provide new insight into how the link between family background and adult earnings varies across the earnings distribution. For instance, is there a particularly strong association in the UK between family background and high rates of adult pay?
This objective has been met. The Fiscal Studies paper cited above includes quantile regression estimates, where I investigate the link between family background and adult earnings across the earnings distribution. These estimates have been produced for multiple countries, with results for the UK placed in a comparative context.


3. To develop academic and policy understanding of how the association between family background, educational attainment and labour market skills varies across developed nations.
This objective has been met. As part of the fellowship I have produced a paper investigating how the link between income inequality, educational attainment, labour market skills and earnings varies across countries. This is available as a working paper and is due for publication in Social Forces. 
I have been able to develop policymakers understanding of this issue via my three month secondment at the OECD. I worked on this project during this period, with the working paper available on the OECD website.

4. To provide new evidence on the magnitude of socio-economic gaps in England, with respect to the different pathways young people follow as young adults (e.g. university entry, youth unemployment, leaving school early).

This objective has largely been met. The project has documented the magnitude of socio-economic gaps in England in a number of dimensions. This includes education attainment in school, labour market skills, university access and completion and labour market outcomes (e.g. earnings). This has considered socio-economic status considered in different ways - both through parental characteristics (e.g. parental education and social class) but also by type of school attended (private school versus state school). One minor area where progress towards this objective was limited was early labour market outcomes. The primary dataset I used in the second strand for the project for England (the LSYPE / Next Steps) only currently has information on respondents up to age 20. In my proposal I expected to be able to consider outcomes up to age 25; though this will become possible the data is not yet available (and hence could not be analysed as part of this project).
5. To describe how these socio-economic gradients vary across four English-speaking countries (England, Canada, Australia and the United States).
This objective has largely been met. All five papers (and one book chapter) written as part of this project document the socio-economic gradient in at least three of these countries. Hence I have produced evidence on SES gaps in educational attainment, university entry, access to a professional job and labour market earnings in each of Australia, England and the United States. One challenge I have faced in two of the papers is accessing the Canadian data (data access agreements changed from the proposal through to completion of the project). Hence, unfortunately, I have not been able to produce comparable results for Canada for some of my analysis.

6. To understand the extent to which these socio-economic gradients (and the differences observed across countries) can be explained by young people's academic ability towards the end of secondary school.
This objective has been met. In most of the papers produced as part of this project, I have investigated the association between family background and various outcomes both with and without controlling for respondents' educational attainment. Thus I have been able to establish the extent to which the association between socio-economic status, various educational transitions and labour market outcomes is mediated by prior educational attainment.

7. To gain experience of working in a non-academic research environment (e.g. a government department or think tank) to enhance my professional network and knowledge exchange skills.

This objective has been met. During the fellowship I completed a three month secondment to the OECD in Paris. This is a major international, non-academic organisation specialising in cross-national comparisons of educational attainment. As a result of my time spent in this institution, I have widened my professional network and knowledge of datasets I frequently use. Likewise, it has provided invaluable experience of how to exchange knowledge with such organisations, and development my skills in this area (particularly in terms of public engagement). Moreover, I am now part of an 'alumni' network with this organisation, with plans to collaborate in future work.
8. To gain experience of working at an overseas academic institution.
This objective has partially been met. In my initial proposal, I planned to spend 10 weeks visiting the university of Melbourne. However, due to the length of time I spent abroad on secondment to the OECD, and changes to my personal circumstances, this was not possible. However, I was able to complete a visit to the University of Barcelona during the fellowship, with a group who I have continued to collaborate with. 

9. To develop my research management skills by taking responsibility for a large budget and a research assistant.

This objective has been met. As part of the project I have employed a full-time research assistant (co-funded with another project) and have acted as their line manager. Likewise, I have been responsible for the finance on this project, with all outputs delivered on budget. 

10. To gain experience of organising and hosting an 'impact seminar' to be attended by at least 50 people.
This objective has been met. As part of the fellowship, I received co-funding from the British Academy to organise an international event for early career researchers. I have tied this into my FRL fellowship by organising a one-day conference entitled 'Inequalities in education in an international context.'</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Strand 1: Family background, labour market skills and earnings

?Throughout my work I have stressed the challenges with producing robust estimates of intergenerational mobility which can legitimately be compared across countries. This has highlighted an important direction for future work - a consistent methodological approach across countries must be applied.
?On England's comparative position in the intergenerational mobility rankings, I believe it will only now be possible to take this work forward if new data become available. For instance, were administrative data become available upon individuals' income, one might be able to estimate income mobility in England, and then draw more robust comparisons to other countries where such data is available (e.g. Sweden, Finland, Singapore). 
?On the cross-national link between income inequality and mobility, future studies may attempt to investigate this relationship longitudinally. In particular, by drawing upon a range of international studies, it may be possible to investigate whether change in income inequality is linked to change in intergenerational mobility. This would help to move the evidence from correlational towards causal. This work should be taken forward by academics working in this field (at the time of writing, I am discussing such work with a colleague within my international network).

Strand 2: Family background and youth transitions across Anglophone countries

?The big picture is that this work could be furthered through collection of internationally comparable data on youth transitions. For instance, a longitudinal follow-up of the PISA cohort across a number of countries. This project has driven forward this agenda by illustrating the range of interesting and important academic and public policy questions such a study could address. An international organisation (such as the OECD) would need to take such a project forward, in order to get a sufficient number of countries involved (and at a high level of engagement). A study of this nature could extend the analysis I have completed in this project by including other countries, enhancing the comparability of estimates (through greater cross-national co-ordination at the stage of data collection) and addressing a range of new and interesting questions.
?As this part of the project focused upon four English-speaking countries, it was not possible to explore country-level factors associated with the magnitude of the estimated socio-economic gradients. Future work may extend my analysis to more countries (particularly if further data does become available). One may then be able to investigate more formally the country-level factors (including institutional structures in the education system and labour market) that are associated with socio-economic inequalities.

?Finally, the extent to which I have been able to investigate early labour market outcomes in England has been limited. This is due to data limitations, with the age 26 sweep of the LSYPE / Next Steps not yet available. Future academic work may update some of my analysis for England once these data become available.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3A7139F4-E75A-4880-A878-96CA33A12B1B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in Ofqual Research Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>72D2A6CF-3BDA-439E-BDDE-823583585993</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>International comparisons course</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F31151BA-4AED-4424-9978-35A825019EC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I develop and conducted a course on international comparisons of educational attainment, specifically using the PISA and PIAAC data.
