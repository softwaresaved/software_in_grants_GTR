This project challenges conventional single purpose sub-optimal antenna design and aims to address the need for wearable antennas with a step change in functionality on a single, physically compact, disposable wearable antenna structure. The core concept of this work is to achieve all three propagating modes using a single antenna with optimal performance, where at least two or more antennas with sub-optimal characteristics and performance would be required. One of the key areas where this advancement would have unquestionable immediate impact is in wireless medical application. The proposed research vision is that this imminent challenge could be solved through advanced antenna design, involving unique materials and compounded higher resonant modes requiring new design methodologies and measurement concepts. The key impact enabler would be a single advanced unobtrusive antenna structure which adapts to all the medical propagation requirements and the diverse physiological and morphological parameters of any human host.

The research proposal follows two main tracks: computational and applied electromagnetics. The computational electromagnetics will be used to support theoretical assumptions and investigate complex antenna structures. The numerical analysis will then be verified using experimental measurements, aligned with application requirements. The work will follow the following programme: 
 WP1: Investigation and numerical exploration of the key requirements of each propagation mode.
 WP2: Investigation and design of compact optimal antenna structures which can be excited at higher resonant modes, to enhance Off, In &amp;amp; Into -Body propagation modes.
 WP3: Investigation and development of switching between modes, to allow mode diversity, integrated into one antenna element 
 WP4: Prototyping and Experimental Measurement 

The proposed research will be in collaboration with Sensium Healthcare. Sensium Healthcare is a UK based company, which is part of the Toumaz Group, who pioneer in low-power, wireless semiconductor and software technologies for Healthcare.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Connected Health and wellbeing is currently a major societal challenge. The Internet of Things (IoT) market is estimated* to be worth 163.24 Billion USD by 2020. The adoption of wireless communications in body centric applications will soon impact everybody's life, particularly in the UK, Europe and USA, as a higher portion of the population gets older. For example, the USA government and private healthcare facilities are currently trying to apply wireless technology in everyday medical practices. These healthcare policies may soon be approved by UK practitioners. The key to impacting this market and reaping the economic and social proceeds is in remaining at the forefront of research and development. The current trend is that these devices communicate wirelessly, therefore rely heavily on antenna performance. The underpinning goal of this work is to expand on existing knowledge and experience to produce innovative systems with clinically and commercially adoptable measurement methodologies. Ultimately, with these investigative capabilities in place, wireless systems with unsurpassed performance will be realised, having a significant impact on marketable products.

The key task in the research will be to develop the capability of three antennas in one antenna element. From a users perspective, this would mean wearing one antennas instead of three antennas, improving comfort and wearability, yet maintaining reliable performance. This is an on-going challenge for the wider communications community. Not only could these antennas and test-beds be used in medical applications, possibly forming the foundation for development and verification of new tumour and breast screening algorithms, but are also relevant in commercial, mobile communication (vehicular and satellite) and lifestyle application wearable technology such as those emerging from Apple, Samsung, Sony etc.

In a recent single propagating mode antenna project completed by the authors, involving medical vital sign monitors, a step change in performance of the vital signs monitor was achieved through advancing and optimising the electromagnetics of the device, with a focus on the wearable antenna performance when connected to the human body. The research immediately has had a transformative impact on the capability of the technology for the primary stakeholder (Sensium Healthcare). Secondary stakeholders such as hospitals and private care homes now have a more reliable system, which monitors more patients with less infrastructure and cost. Furthermore, the improved performance has now the potential to realise the technology concept for in-home care.

Academic Impact: By publically disseminating the research results in leading conferences and journals, other disciplines may further there research and understanding, which may lead to future cross-discipline collaborations or inward investment. Implanted research has been targeted at human medical applications, where, performance and clinical application requirements are most critical. However, the knowledge and techniques may be directly transferable where the systems are used on animals and possibly RFID tag applications.
