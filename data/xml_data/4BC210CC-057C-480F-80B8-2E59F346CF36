&lt;p>Through international conferences, UK practitioner roundtables, and post-graduate advanced seminars this seminar series will address key questions about the workings, outcomes, models and claims and impacts of social entrepreneurship.Key questions include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How is social enterprise mobilising people, driving policies, attracting finance and shaping politics at national and international levels?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How are goods and technologies that are being marketed to the global poor endowed with moral power and the capacity to bring development benefits?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How is the social impact of these goods being measured by governments, business or international organisations and how might participant perspectives suggest different measures for development outcomes?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How does an ethic of humanitarian capitalism reflect broader social concerns and economic tensions? &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? 
This seminar series will make critical ideas, debates, and concepts that interrogate the relationships between business and development available to policy makers, practitioners and wider publics as they seek new ways to address the challenges of global poverty. It will have widespread appeal to a range of stakeholder communities from beneficiaries in government, the private sector and the third sector. 
There are several specific categories of stakeholders for whom this seminar series and its outputs will be of particular interest, and with whom the co-investigators have established working relationships. These include: those involved in policy making in international development institutions (DfiD, World Bank, UNDP) and think tanks (ODI); practitioner networks (Business Fights Poverty, Network of International Development Organisations in Scotland); and global corporations (e.g. Unilever, Danone, Nestle, Coca-Cola), private sector consultancy firms (Accenture, Price Waterhouse Coopers, Deloitte), social enterprises (SolarAid/SunnyMoney, Living Goods etc.), and INGOs (Oxfam, CARE, Action Aid, PLAN) that have a stake in delivering outcomes for the global poor. In addition the series will also be of interest to journalists from news and media organisations that cover international development issues (The Guardian, New Statesman, Prospect, New Internationalist).
Though these stakeholders have divergent interests, each will benefit from enhanced understanding of the motives, values, and experiences of organisations outside their networks. We will extend invitations to participate through the extensive academic and institutional networks, partnerships and collaborations that each of our Co-investigators bring. 

How will they benefit? 
- Policy beneficiaries: It is anticipated that the seminar presentations (paper and poster), discussion and outputs (on the website, and in journal and book form) will directly contribute to informing evidence-based policy and to formulating market-based initiatives that respond to development concerns around health, energy, and poverty, ethically and sustainably.
- Practice beneficiaries: Those who attend the seminars or access the outputs will, it is hoped, gain a new critical awareness of the wider contexts within which business has become an agent of development, and its diverse impacts. 
- Wider Publics: The series will act as a springboard for critical enquiry about the role of business and development among the UK public. Given the widespread public attention afforded other forms of commercial engagement in development such as Fairtrade, microfinance and corporate social responsibility, we envisage that the ethics of current private sector initiatives at the BoP will similarly galvanise the interest of the wider public. Our experience organising a public debate on BoP strategies demonstrated that social media tools and online communication can foster public interaction and build community rapidly and we thus plan to use our dedicated website (www.responsiblebop.com) and social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to bring the issues raised in the seminar series to a wider audience. The Beltane Network for Public Engagement, based in Edinburgh, will provide key support in helping us to maximise the reach of these activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29663</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Off-Grid Energy Technology and Markets at the Bottom of the Pyramid</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A31D510-DB8F-42D6-BA50-25449B598C62</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Event presented opportunity to hear different perspectives on research and practice in off-grid energy from a variety of actors.

The seminar series has successfully brought together groups of scholars (academics, researchers and students) from across social science disciplines and across the UK and beyond to discuss and debate the relationship between business and international development, using the widely made claim that for-profit social entrepreneurship can 'do good by doing well' as a entry point to discussion and analysis. To date we have hosted:

*) Academic/practitioner seminars focused on 1) energy technologies (University of Edinburgh, 2014); 2) diagnostic technologies (University of Edinburgh, 2015
*) Interdisciplinary scholarly seminars focused on 1) Humanitarian Goods (University of Edinburgh, 2015); 2) Informality and Entrepreneurship at the Bottom of the Pyramid. (University of Sussex, 2015.
