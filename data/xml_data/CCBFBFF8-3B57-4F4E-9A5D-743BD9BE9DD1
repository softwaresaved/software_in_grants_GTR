The materials properties are additionally similar to industry gold standard semiconductor GaAs, making them a very attractive field of research with thousands of researchers active worldwide. However, some challenges need to be overcome before commercialization of the technology can occur: stability and toxicity concerns need to be addressed. Previous attempts to replace the lead atoms in the structure have either resulted in less stable systems (Sn), or highly distorted material structures (Bi, Cu, etc.) which show very reduced materials properties and consequently low device efficiencies. 

This proposal seeks to address these challenges by developing new materials based on a structure related to the state-of-the-art materials: the double perovskite structure. Here, the lead atoms are replaced by alternating non-toxic alternatives which are air stable elements and can be processed from solution. Specific objectives in this First Grant Project are to develop a novel thin film deposition technique which will allow the incorporation of this type of new materials into functional devices. The successful completion of the project is expected to enable researchers world-wide to target a whole new range of perovskite materials not just for solar energy conversion but also for lighting applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Knowledge
The knowledge generated by this project will contribute to the international research effort to develop low-cost solar cells. The broad scope of the research will also help facilitate the transfer of ideas between researchers and add to the UK's research profile. Demonstrating new applications for the fascinating perovskite family of materials should generate considerable interest within both the academic and public spheres.

Society
Solar energy is currently an underutilised resource as photovoltaic uptake by the general public has not been realised. The public perceives solar energy as a long-term investment, i.e. difficult and expensive to install with rather long payback times; particularly in generally low-light conditions in the UK. As detailed in pathways to impact, I will thus focus on engaging the public on the simplicity of deposition of the perovskite technology, which will allow further reduction costs of solar panels. We will organise workshops where the general public can build a perovskite solar cell in science fairs across the country. Additionally, enabling low-energy lighting technologies will help to reduce carbon emission in both developed and the developing world, where the developed low-cost perovskite-based devices throughout the course of this project could make a strong impact. There is thus a potential for huge impact in terms of mitigating CO2 emission, energy security, and in particular the development of off-grid communities.

Economy
This project will contribute to the development of photovoltaics as a sustainable energy source. In off-grid regions, scalable photovoltaic panels requiring only a modest capital investment can bring major benefits by powering computers and telecommunications. Within the UK there is also a growing demand for photovoltaics to capitalise on recently introduced feed-in tariffs. The UK is also a global centre for the commercialization of DSSCs and by extension, perovskite photovoltaics, with G24i Solar having already shipped its first commercial order of cells and Tata Steel Colors investing heavily in the technology (&amp;pound; 10m PV accelerator project to coat strip steel with DSSCs). 
To ensure full economic impact in the UK, I have established strong links with Oxford PV. Here, I will be in close contact with senior scientists from this company who will help guide the development of the project with a view of commercialising the devices.

People
The project will involve training a postdoctoral researcher, master students and a department supported PhD student who will develop wide-ranging experimental and theoretical skills in what is a rapidly growing and high profile area. Following their efforts within the project, they will be well positioned not only within the multi-disciplinary research world, but also to satisfy the increasing demand for highly trained individuals by companies in the field. The School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering has an outstanding track record boosting local economic development in the North East, where approximately half of the UK &amp;amp; EU graduating PhD students go on to find professional employment locally within 6 months of their degrees. Overall, upwards of 80% of graduating students find employment in engineering professions, indicating a high demand for the retention of skills in the field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101100</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P03148X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1175C1D0-52DD-4F11-A1B8-E080CABC3609</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar Technology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
