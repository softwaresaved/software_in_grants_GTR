All</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/P006906/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The severe labour exploitation encapsulated in terms like 'forced labour', 'bonded labour', 'child labour', 'human trafficking' and 'modern slavery' is widely regarded as a major contemporary development challenge. Indeed India alone is said to have to have the highest number of modern slaves (18.3 million) in the world (Global Slavery Index 2016) and many regions including South Asia, Africa and Latin America face the gravest challenges in achieving &amp;quot;decent work for all&amp;quot;. Although governments and civil society have decried such practices as 'the underside of globalisation' and as an affront to human dignity, passed anti-slavery and anti-trafficking legislation, and spent over &amp;pound;1.5 billion since the turn of the century on anti-slavery policy, the world's leaders have nevertheless placed 'forced labour', 'human trafficking' and 'modern slavery' at the heart of the Sustainable Development Agenda, with SDG 8.7 calling directly for their eradication. 

This reflects the fact that policy aimed at ridding the world of severe exploitation is consistently hampered by a dearth of nuanced, sophisticated empirical understandings. The Beyond Trafficking and Slavery network (BTS) exists to fill precisely this gap. BTS is a multi-disciplinary group of academics and civil society organisations from the global north and global south who are experts on the severe exploitation targeted by SDG 8.7. Established in 2014, BTS operates primarily through openDemocracy.net, an established 'digital commons' based in the UK that commands an annual readership of over nine million unique visitors. Combining the rigour of academic scholarship with the clarity of journalism and the immediacy of political advocacy, it brings together scholars, policy-makers, and civil society organisations keen to advance understanding of, and policies to address, the structural, political, economic, and social root causes of global exploitation, vulnerability and unfree labour. In the past two years alone, BTS hs published over 300 articles from more than 200 contributors, and entered into public debate with large institutional actors including Human Rights Watch, the International Labour Organisation and the UK's Anti-Slavery Commissioner. 

BTS now intends to expand this work by engaging directly with research and activism in developing countries from South Asia (India), Africa (South Africa) and Latin America (Mexico). BTS will convene regional workshops in these countries bringing together all relevant stakeholders, including critical academic voices, high-level political officials, NGOs, the UN, labour and business organisations, donors, civil society and individuals with expertise on severe labour exploitation. It will host capacity-building trainings for local and regional civil society alongside these workshops, co-ordinate joint mapping of the knowledge terrain around SDG 8.7, and joint articulation of a research agenda that can equip policy-makers, particularly in the global south, with the conceptual and empirical tools necessary to achieve it, fostering south-south knowledge sharing in the process. 

BTS will conclude its expanded network activities by drafting a report for the ESRC-GCRF (given its focus on migration and development, inequalities, and inclusive growth) entitled The Global Research Agenda for SDG 8.7: Understanding and Addressing Forced Labour, Human Trafficking and Modern-Day Slavery. This will be shared widely with global stakeholders engaged around SDG 8.7, as will workshop proceedings and the latest research. Public dissemination will take place through the BTS website at openDemocracy.net, using text, podcasts, and video, as well as a targeted social media strategy. BTS will also lay the foundations for a UK-based Centre for the Study of Modern Slavery, which will position the UK as a world leader in responding to this development challenge, in turn informing future UK donor and research policy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Since October 2014, BTS has attracted half a million unique visitors from more than 100 countries and contributions from key institutions including Oxfam, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and UNESCO. The BTS website has published over 300 articles from over 250 different authors, and released its acclaimed Short Course (BTS 2016, Vols. 1-9), the world's first open-access 'e-syllabus' on forced labour, trafficking, and slavery. BTS not only commands academic expertise and a worldwide academic network, but also strong relationships with core stakeholders including trade unions (International Trade Union Confederation, National Trade Union Initiative, Asia Floor Wage Alliance), international organisations (UNICEF, UNESCO, ILO), NGOs (Anti-Slavery International, Walk Free, The Freedom Fund, La Strada International), governments and grassroots groups. BTS has been endorsed by the EU's Anti-Trafficking Commissioner, the former UN Special Rapporteur on Modern Slavery, La Strada International and the Freedom Fund. BTS has become a key reference point in high-profile political debates, including around Britain's Modern Slavery Bill and Immigration Bill (now both Acts), during which it received contributions from several commentators seeking to influence parliament. Thus, BTS is accustomed to generating knowledge in the formats necessary to effectively reach its beneficiaries and users, namely, policy-makers, students, activists, and the general public. 
BTS now seeks to co-define a global research agenda around SDG 8.7, which the ILO identifies as essential for promoting &amp;quot;decent work for all&amp;quot; (ILO 2016). Building on its efforts to map the terrain of critical knowledge on issues relating to SDG 8.7 over the past two years, BTS will achieve this by convening three regional workshops designed to generate a systematic, original and practical account of the most effective ways of understanding and addressing severe exploitation and vulnerability in the global south, by integrating underlying socio-economic dynamics such as migration, inequality and insecurity into the analysis. We are confident of leading these workshops. The PI is on the advisory board of the five-year, ILO-DFID Work in Freedom project that seeks to facilitate safe migration of women from South Asia, and thus has access to a large network of actors in Nepal, Bangladesh and India. Similarly, our international co-investigators:Neil Howard (Belgium), Joel Quirk (South Africa), Gabriella Sanchez (Mexico) and Ana Lucia Araujo (Brazil) - have extensive networks in Africa and Latin America, which they will leverage to achieve participation and impact across the other regional workshops. While several BTS network members have long-standing relationships with the ILO (not least Dr Khan, who is its Head of Research and Evaluation), the key agency coordinating 'Alliance 8.7'. At the regional workshops, BTS will craft a global research agenda on SDG 8.7 in close collaboration with the beneficiaries and users of its research, namely, academics, governments, state bodies, NGOs, trade unions, the UN, business organisations and donors. These actors will in turn use these workshops not only to network with each other but to identify and advocate for policy initiatives to make SDG 8.7 a reality. BTS will share its workshop reports and the final project report with all participating stakeholders, at an ESRC-GCRF launch event in London, and online in multi-media format. Other beneficiaries will include the global network of scholars and activists aggregated around BTS' online portal, including many from the global south; local and regional actors attending capacity-building trainings held alongside the workshops; and the central stakeholders engaged in Alliance 8.7, including participating southern governments and northern donors (who will benefit from targeted policy suggestions). The BTS website will be critical for reaching these stakeholders for the life of the ESRC-GCRF awards.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147038</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P006906/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
