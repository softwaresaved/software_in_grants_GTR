Online research methods (ORM) represent cutting edge methodological developments in the social sciences but as yet there is no coherent training or professional development provision in these methods available for UK social scientists.TRI-ORM will fill this clearly identified gap in research training and will build on the work of the project ?Exploring Online Methods in a Virtual Training Environment?, funded by the ESRC Research Methods Programme (RMP)(Phase 2) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-333-25-0001/read&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>RES-333-25-0001&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To achieve widespread training in ORM, a flexible training programme has been developed to cater for varying levels of knowledge, varying stages of career development and different modes of learning. The training programme will include three strands (hence TRI-ORM):&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>six face-to-face, one-day introductory workshops based in ESRC Regional Training Centres&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>ten week online training module for advanced users&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>self-directed study through the already established website and further enhancement of this resource.&lt;/li>

The project was designed to meet the training needs of researchers at all stages of their careers and with a variety of levels of knowledge of online research. The project was very successful and outperformed all original estimates of the number of researchers to be trained.

TRI-ORM was made up of three strands each of which was targeted at different levels of engagement and experience. The first strand provided face-to-face workshops for researchers with very little knowledge or experience of online research methods. The second stand was an advanced course taught at Masters level and delivered online. Finally the project enhanced its existing website providing new resources for learners and further support for tutors as well as establishing a blog and online professional networking site.

Key achievements of the project include:
- Enabling researchers from different stages of the career spectrum, a wide range of disciplinary areas and from within and outside higher education to develop their understanding of online research methods and learn from each other.

- Being delivered on time, on budget and training 232 researchers - 72 (45%) more than outlined in the original bid.

- Developing a successful way to teach research methods online that can be utilised by other teachers and trainers.

- Feedback from participants which indicated that they were using the learning from the online course in their professional practice six months after participating in a workshop.

- Statistics that indicate the sustained and international reach of the web-resources.

- The establishment of a virtual community of ORM practitioners in the UK and beyond.

- Invitations to the project team to contribute to journal articles, book chapters and sit on the steering group of a national online survey of researchers as a result of their involvement in the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Many of the participants of the workshops came from the non-academic sector.

The training programme included:
(a) Six face-to-face one-day introductory workshops designed to introduce 120 researchers with 
little or no prior experience of ORM to these innovative methodologies. 
(b) Two iterations of a ten week online training module for up to 40 advanced users of ORM. 
(c) Further enhancement and development of the already established 'Exploring Online Research 
Methods' website to increase its reach and effectiveness as a resource for tutors of ORM and
