The data obtained will be contrasted with classical theories in order to get an insight into their formation mechanisms and dynamics.

Queen's University Belfast (QUB) has a strong group investigating a wide range of functional materials, especially ferroelectrics and this project seeks to build upon this experience. However, the principal component of this research relies on performing in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, heating and electrical biasing, which are not available at QUB. The samples for this project are already being characterized at a basic level at QUB using the existing electron microscopy facilities. The intention of this project is to take these samples to advanced electron microscopy centres, specialising in in-situ TEM experiments for the central part of the project. 

Four experiments in two different international laboratories are being designed as part of this proposal. The intention is for them to be carried out in summer (July-Sept) 2014. The international visits will provide experience and the opportunity to obtain new expertise in a new and exciting technique for studying dynamics of functional materials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Electron microscopy is a broad area that envelops a number of techniques that are invaluable for both industry (R&amp;amp;D technology, as well as routine techniques for quality control) and research. These techniques include focused ion beam (FIB), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FIB and TEM have high running costs and although they have recently become more accessible to industrial companies (as in the case of Seagate), they still represent an expensive investment that requires specialised infrastructure and highly qualified staff to maintain and operate such instruments. The need for such instruments is becoming more evident, considering the current miniaturization of electronic devices. Therefore, it is clear that there is a latent need for qualified people to work on this area and further the development of these techniques.
Recently, from QUB, the Centre for Nanostructured Media (CNM) alone has supplied 19 qualified PhD employees to regional companies, such as Seagate, Andor, Kyocera and Intel in Dublin. These companies are highly interested in dynamic characterization and functionality studies of materials and devices that will provide salient information on the properties of their products for both quality control and R&amp;amp;D activities. A clear example of a direct benefit is the ongoing collaboration with industry; Seagate Springtown has been actively involved in PhD sponsorship and support of research activities based in UK Universities such as; Glasgow, York, Exeter and our &amp;pound;9M investment of donated equipment and capital to facilitate the establishment of ANSIN, an advanced materials hub at QUB. This collaboration will significantly benefit from the newly acquired techniques and skills ensuring the mutual support and preservation of an already fruitful enterprise.
In Northern Ireland, only QUB and the University of Ulster house electron microscopy units. At QUB the focus is dedicated to materials science, especially thesemiconductor industry and functional materials. In the last year, CNM has invested significant resources for the expansion and improvement of the microscopy facilities, with a strong emphasis on pushing TEM techniques forward. This is evident by the increase in academic staff, including two specialised electron microscopists. While there is a clear need for training people in general microscopy techniques, it is also crucial to attract and train more people in cutting-edge techniques if we are to increase and improve the quality of research. Hence, by doing so we are not only creating new collaborations and enhancing the existing ones in the region and the UK, but also we are improving the student experience by offering better facilities and the access to new and exciting discoveries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11757</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>18th International Microscopy Congress</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5BD9D365-2711-4BCE-BA12-495046FC7798</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presentation in the conference session</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A framework for understanding electron beam-induced domain nucleation and growth in a ferroelectric was developed.
