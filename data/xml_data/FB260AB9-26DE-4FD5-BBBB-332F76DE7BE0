The description of sea ice rheology in existing climate models treats the ice cover as isotropic, so that at a given location there is equal resistance to failure in all directions. However, it has been known for over a decade that the ice cover is highly anisotropic, with oriented cracks present at all length scales, and these cracks control the directions of preferential deformation. 

While researchers have been aware of the importance of anisotropic mechanics, only recently has a model of anisotropic rheology been constructed and incorporated into the sea ice component of a climate model. 

This project aims to eliminate fundamental uncertainty in the processes controlling anisotropy creation and destruction through a combination of recently produced, high-resolution satellite deformation maps and computer modelling. A major result of the research will be a new representation of anisotropic sea ice rheology incorporated into the CICE sea ice model, which is the sea ice model used in many climate models, including the UK Hadley Centre series of climate models.

The reduction of Arctic sea ice extent has generated wide-spread interest with numerous articles in the popular press, radio, television and internet. A major practical impact of this proposal is in the generation of a more realistic, anisotropic treatment of sea ice rheology in the sea ice component of several climate models. The new treatment of sea ice rheology will lead to improved climate and regional prediction studies, used to guide national and international policy on issues related to climate change. 

Reduction in the sea ice cover is already opening up shipping routes and the potential for oil exploration has generated political statements and actions including, for example, the placement of the Russian flag at the North Pole and Denmark's declaration of sea bed rights up to the North Pole. Lloyd's of London, with Chatham House, published a report called &amp;quot;Arctic Opening&amp;quot; earlier this year, with business (including insurance) expansion in mind. 

Improved predictions of the Arctic sea ice cover will benefit the shipping and insurance industries. The predictions of ice cover evolution and ice stresses will benefit the construction and efficiency of oil exploration platforms.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>289410</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has not yet had time to produce useable findings, but this is our objective.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DCE02079-14BB-413A-A8DA-9F21B9131DFC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1.

2. Note: appointment started on 1 April 2014.

Initial work has focussed on procuring and analysing GLOBICE and RADARSAT data on sea ice deformation and analysis of this data to produce gridded fields of the anisotropy tensor.

Trials simulations of the Arctic sea ice cover have been performed with a model accounting for anisotropy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Improved representation of the physics of sea ice anisotropy will affect sea ice predictions in climate models and local predictions.

The project is designed so that new physics developments will be included in the sea ice climate model CICE, where they will be used by other modelling and climate prediction groups including the Met Office, NOC and BAS.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4696386A-1DDA-4833-9A28-06D3AFA0BDA2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Input to Arctic Select Committee of House of Lords - oral and written evidence</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Australia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2C1BBA36-464B-4A16-BDA9-F27F9F53FCA5</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/arcticcom/publications/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Research projects have developed new physics of sea ice processes.
