Asia-Pacific Practices</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N004736/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The aims of the proposal is to create and establish an international research network on an emerging and relatively undocumented field of Design for Social Innovation by creating a platform for knowledge sharing between researchers and practitioners in the UK and Asia-Pacific region. 

The term 'Social Innovation' has become widely used, actively promoted by governments, organisations, academia and businesses alike. According to the Design for Social Innovation Report published by the European Commission (2014, pg 2), they state; &amp;quot;Social innovation is the concept of developing new - often disruptive solutions that work towards meeting social goals.&amp;quot; Arguably, communities and organisations have always tackled problems and effected change for the social and public good. However, in the last ten years, we have witnessed a growing interest and use of design to enable social innovation due to the on-going financial crisis in the UK, Europe and the US. Design is seen as a way to harness latent creativity and participation from various stakeholders' local, situated knowledge. With a rich history of socially focused initiatives and current political idea of the 'Big Society', UK has a leading number of practitioners and researchers currently operating in this field. 

The strong economic development in Asia in the last 15 years has increased the West's interest in the region. A recent report from the Australian Government Trade Commission report (AUSTRADE, 2015) suggests that the ASEAN 5's (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam) GDP growth will far outstrip the Euro zone. Furthermore, Australia is entering its 24th year of uninterrupted economic growth, with GDP projection higher than the US, UK or Europe. However, even prosperous economies like Australia, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong are facing challenges to balance sustainable economic development with social and political changes. There are now strong signs that the interest in using design to facilitate social change is growing in Asia-Pacific by the increasing number of social innovation labs being established in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and Korea.

Our proposal aims to connect UK researchers with current practices in Asia-Pacific, leveraging the experience and knowledge of leading researchers in the UK to inform practices in Asia-Pacific, while at the same time using examples from Asia-Pacific to enrich and inform the understanding of Design for Social Innovation in the UK. As such, there will be three key activities in Thailand and the UK that will bring together this dispersed community of practice. A public symposium bringing together examples from the Asia-Pacific region will be held in Bangkok, followed by a workshop aimed at identifying issues, themes and opportunities for further research. The outcomes from the Bangkok symposium and workshop will be shared as points of discussion with participants in the UK and to shape the practitioner workshop that will be used to inform practices and identify research opportunities in the UK. 
 
The interactions between the participants and presentations given will be made available to the wider community through a dedicated community-led project website. The community platform will house various resources created from the proposed events, and links to various social innovators, social enterprises, funding bodies, NGOs, project initiatives, research networks, governmental bodies and companies in Design and Social Innovation. It will also become a repository for academic research and publications relevant to the field, and house project notices that may arise in the future. The platform will enable us to not only enable the continued dissemination of the research outcomes but to facilitate continued dialogue between the communities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research network aims to facilitate knowledge generation and exchange between UK and Asia-Pacific academics and practitioners in Design for Social Innovation. It will generate impact in a number of communities linked to Design and Social Innovation. 

Design practice community - For the design practitioners working on social innovation projects in the UK, participation in the workshop will be an opportunity to make connections, share best practices, learn about the Asia-Pacific context and identify project opportunities. For UK based practitioners looking to find opportunities to work in Asia-Pacific, the workshop will help them understand the similarities and differences between the UK and Asia-Pacific and to identify qualities, skills, mindsets and conditions. For Asia-Pacific practitioners, participation in the public symposium and workshop will enable them to hear stories of successes and failures from the region, and learn from UK practices. Attendance at the events will offer opportunities to connect with people from incubators, NGOS, think tanks, innovation hubs, social entrepreneurs, social venture funds and governmental departments. For the invited speakers, it would offer an international platform to showcase their work and to extend their reach beyond their locality. This will strengthen their standing in their community and demonstrate value they could bring to future project bids. The additional resources published on the project website will also provide a range of varied examples in different countries, offering inspiration and connection to other practitioners and provide a way to track project notices in the future. 

Social innovators and social entrepreneurs - social innovators and entrepreneurs are the individuals and teams that are responsible for initiating, developing and creating social development projects and social enterprises. For the invited speakers, it would offer an international platform to showcase and disseminate work. It would also offer an opportunity to meet other people working in this area, share best practices and create new networks. The published case studies, talks, reports and academic papers on the website will be a valuable resource to help people outside the sector understand the range and type of work practiced in the region. The examples collected and disseminated through the online platform will also provide them with successful exemplars that can be used to lobby for funds to support current and new projects. 

Policy-makers, legislators and their advisors - With the increasing use of design to facilitate social innovation, the research will be help policy-makers understand the role, impact and conditions for the use of design to facilitate more effective social innovation projects. Learnings from the events and resources should inform the creation of policies that will establish and build a support structure in countries where there is a lack of infrastructure for this space. Academic outputs such as a journal special issue and a conference paper will be used to support evidence based policy making approach. 

Government departments and local government - Many governments are often supporting social innovation, and this traction is increasing globally. They are a key stakeholder in initiating, enabling and sustaining social innovation.The proposed events will help disseminate the work to a wider audience and provide more visibility of local initiatives to their respective national agencies and departments. 

National Design Boards/Councils - Project exemplars and other resources collated will provide evidence of impact of design in social innovation to organisations tasked to promote the use of design for different purposes across different sectors. The coalescing of practitioners from a diverse background will enable tracking of a growing community of practitioners working in this field and help understand how to support future growth in this sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37717</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DESIAP Rekanegara</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0535D54E-FE6B-436B-9322-B1A907C836C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk was organised by Rekanegara, a not-for-profit group set up by Malaysian design academics and practitioners as a platform to discuss and debate current issues in design. They invited the PI to talk at a Social Innovation theme day on the issues and challenges of design working in the space of social innovation. The talk generated interests amongst the Rekanegara community evidenced by the discussion during the event and on their Facebook page. The event also gave the PI an opportunity to meet and make contact with a social entrepreneur (who was the other invited speaker) and help connect what she does in her work with designers. Rekanegara has also indicated an interest to support future DESIAP network events and discussions are underway to hold the next DESIAP symposium in Malaysia.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DESIAP Sharing Workshop in Newcastle upon Tyne</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2FEDA930-0633-4C83-82FA-5EE9C102AE8C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim the workshop is bring together UK-based practitioners and researchers working in design and social innovation to share practices as well learn from each other. The research team shared learnings from the Bangkok DESIAP symposium - distilled in 6 themes (Time/temporality, Ethics, Cultural nuances, Relations, Precariousness/risk &amp;amp; Impact) and used these themes to cohere thinking around issues. The workshop consisted of researchers and participants who have taken part in original public symposium in Bangkok as well as new participants from around the UK. Conversations with the participants sparked discussion around practices and models of social innovation and how it related to various sectors (private, public or voluntary). This has led to the PI and Co-I being invited to share the research findings at the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) in June 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DESIAP 2017 Bangkok Symposium and Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E9A1C071-45F3-466A-84BB-F02E286E9733</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our 2016 DESIAP Public Symposium and Workshop was held at the Thailand Creative and Design Center (TCDC) in Bangkok from the 12th to 14th of July 2016.

We have used these 6 themes to frame a number of projects going forward beyond the project funding. Firstly its being used as a theoretical framework for our AHRC GCRF Network Plus funding proposal and project and secondly, as content for a proposed edited book with Bloomsbury. 

Through the activities of the network, we have fostered new links and collaborations with organisations involved in social innovations in Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia. These links are being utilised through the AHRC GCRF Network Plus funding bid and these organisations are named collaborators on the bid. We have also connected with Asia-Pacific academics and they too have been named as Co-Investigators in the funding bid. We have also carefully paired UK and AP researchers with AP practitioners to co-author papers based on those 6 themes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Design practice community - For the design practitioners working on social innovation projects in UK, participation in the UK-based workshop was an opportunity to make connections, share best practices, learn about the Asia-Pacific context and identify project opportunities for collaboration and work. For example, Bas Raijmakers from STBY(a member of the research network) has used the opportunity to explore the AP landscape and have took the opportunity to expand their existing REACH network into Thailand. For UK based practitioners looking to find opportunities to work in Asia-Pacific, the workshop has helped them understand the similarities and differences between the UK and Asia-Pacific and to identify qualities, skills, mindsets and conditions. This has led to an invitation to the RSA for example to share findings from the DESIAP Research Network. For Asia-Pacific practitioners, participation in the public symposium and workshop enabled them to hear stories of successes and failures from the region, and learn from UK practices. It offered them opportunities to connect with people from incubators, NGOS, think tanks, innovation hubs, social entrepreneurs, social venture funds and governmental departments.
