This will be a major challenge. The new philosophy, &amp;quot;small is beautiful&amp;quot;, starts by encouraging the use of high quality feedstock, only melting what is required and only when it is required. Recycling of internal scrap is not necessarily acceptable but an aim for higher yields is. Applying counter gravity casting methods to improve yield and give enhanced quality is encouraged as is the recovery low grade heat from solidification.
The project will achieve this by the development of a software tool incorporating a new philosophy/methodology and metric for the handling of materials and energy throughout the process in foundries using computer numerical process simulation to support the decision making. The project would also look at the full energy chain from charge materials through to waste heat and energy in the process and identify the opportunities for scavenging waste heat and the costs associated with the whole process. This will therefore enable cost/benefit analysis to be undertaken so that companies will be able to make informed decisions about design, material and process at a very early stage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The DECC report on UK energy published in July 2013 showed the total UK energy usage in 2012 as being 206 million tonnes oil equivalent (mtoe) or 8.7 ExaJ (8.7 x 1018 J) of which about 17% was used by industry. An estimate has been made that approximately 4% (about 60,000 TJ) of this is used by the foundry industry. By adopting the new philosophy proposed in this research for foundry manufacturing processes then this could be more than halved.
In order to get industrial engagement and develop potential pathways into manufacturing we are initially working with a core of software companies who already supply materials selection software and process modelling solutions into the foundry industry. The companies will be involved in meetings to help define the research direction and help with the implementation of the software code. Professor Jolly already works closely with the Cast metals Federation (CMF) and the Institute of Cast Metals Engineers (ICME) sitting on both technical and education committees. By involving both these organisations in understanding the new philosophy the concepts can be introduced into the industry's training courses which are delivered by these organisations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>233012</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop for  Road-Mapping Towards  a Sustainable Lower Energy Foundry</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6009C012-D6D2-4C98-90D2-94B7677CC67A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Road-Mapping towards a Sustainable Lower Energy Foundry workshop took place on the 2nd of December 2015 at Cast Metals Federation (CMF). Foundries and Academic experts from across the UK were invited by CMF and Cranfield University to discuss the challenges and benefits of achieving sustainable lower energy foundries. This research is based on &amp;quot;Energy Resilient Manufacturing (analysis)&amp;quot; through the EPSRC funded &amp;quot;Small is Beautiful&amp;quot; project. The second workshop will be held in July 2016.
To move forward in the short term foundries suggest, to increase awareness of impact across life cycle, introduce life cycle assessment (LCA) tools, use energy audit to assess 'as is' and create future targets for reductions, train people, practice simulation for assessing scenarios, Invest in technology, define a clear business plan and agenda from the top against a time plan.
Medium term they recommend to improve evidential design capability, increase sharing and collaborations, breaking down barriers / increase opportunities to collaboration, develop an inter group / network for sharing and research, stop relying on suppliers to get new information and develop own capability, develop a culture of sharing / innovation / co-production, KPIs, benchmarking between companies and sharing and working in partnership with universities.
In the long term, foundries advice to introduce new technology for rapid prototyping, more tailored, flexible, complete solutions, value added and integrating design. Produce a solution not just manufacturing what the customer asks for. Augmented reality, disruptive technologies, innovate UK funding for projects, understand funding available for innovative projects, changing government legislation, machinery investment, overseas partnership and pressure on companies compliance with H&amp;amp;S and environmental issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>755750</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Energy Resilient Manufacturing 2: Small is Beautiful Phase 2 (SIB2)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/P012272/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>25B70E21-DC92-4C37-99F4-AE488EE9558D</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A workshop was organized on 2nd December 2015, hosted by the Cast Metals Federation (CMF), with the title &amp;quot;Road-mapping towards a sustainable lower energy foundry&amp;quot; with 25 representatives (18 from industry) from 14 organisations of which there were 8 foundries, 2 suppliers and a consultant as well as the CMF, Cranfield University and another university. During the workshop the findings were presented and discussed, and the attendees collaborated in discussing sustainability, barriers, inhibitors and strategies towards sustainable foundries. The findings of the workshop were published in a trade magazine in February 2016. The workshop confirmed the initial findings and highlighted the need for an energy auditing framework and a tool for the fast analysis of the measurements. The workshop raised the awareness on the importance of energy efficiency for the foundries and highlighted the cost savings that this can potentially have.

In March 2016 an agreement with 4 international foundries was set up for benchmarking their practices. A team of 7 MSc students was formed that visited the foundries, contacted more than 100 companies and industry experts (including other foundries, suppliers, raw material suppliers, etc.).

A computer program is under development and is designed to support a systematic analysis of the full energy and material chain of casting processes from charge materials through to waste and it will be linked to product design software. This tool has been presented in technical meetings since June 2016 to almost 10 international foundries and commercial product design software representatives generating significant interest.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3242A20E-6A6D-4FBE-9D76-C893F657D932</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A thorough analysis of the current practices in the foundries in the UK was undertaken. In total, 48 foundries (across a number of casting processes and cast alloys) were contacted over 6 months and 8 foundries (17% response rate) provided information on the energy consumption profile, materials handling and waste streams. The key findings (KF) from this survey can be summarized into: foundries do not monitor the energy consumption in detail, but rather focus in energy bills (KF1), foundries do not know how to measure the energy consumption of their installed systems (KF2), subsequently energy consumption and emissions are not considered to be among the key decision making criteria (KF3), and finally there are indications of major differences on practices between the foundries (KF4), and is worth identifying any differences with major foundries from overseas. A workshop with 25 representatives (18 from industry) from 14 organisations of which there were 8 foundries, 2 suppliers and a consultant as well as the Cast Metals Federation, Cranfield and another University confirmed the initial findings and highlighted the need for an energy auditing framework (KF5) and a tool for the fast analysis of the measurements
