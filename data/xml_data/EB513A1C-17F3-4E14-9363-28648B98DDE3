It has been argued that countries with strong legal minority shareholder protection will have well-developed financial markets. This claim has not only influenced the policy recommendations of IMF and World Bank, but arguably directly inspired the legislators in at least one EU country (the Draghi law adopted in Italy in 1998).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Surprisingly, few researchers have systematically investigated the impact of changing legal rules on corporate governance practices at the firm level. We therefore know comparatively little about what impact recent legal changes had on companies' behaviour and how this affects a country's corporate governance regime as a whole.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of this research is to compare the evolution of corporate governance practices of the largest companies in four European countries (UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland) to legal changes over the last twenty years. The study creates a Shareholder Orientation Index (SOI) of corporate governance practices that is comparable across countries and within countries over time. This will generate new insights into the relationship between law and agency in corporate governance reform.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>225254</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Throughout the period of the grant considerable effort has been made to disseminate key findings and create impact beyond academia.

Three strategies were pursued throughout the duration of the grant and beyond.

1. The PI has attempted to establish contacts with journalists to disseminate the findings of the project and create impact. Thus, in February 2015, the PI was interviewed by Merrill Stevenson, European Business Editor, at The Economist regarding the takeover of a Swiss company by a French one (the SIKA-Saint Gobain takeover). The contact was established following the presentation of a project-related paper at the inaugural World Interdisciplinary Network of Institutional Research (WINIR) conference in September 2014 at the University of Greenwich. This background interview allowed the PI to share key insights into the Swiss corporate governance model with a journalist from a leading publication in the area of business and economics. Other efforts to feed the insights from the project into the mainstream media - notably in Switzerland in relation to a popular initiative on manager salary and the SIKA takeover - have been undertaken. Media presence would seem an important pre-condition for creating impact. As a result, these efforts will be further pursued as the results from the data analysis emerge.

2. The PI engaged in continued conversations with corporate governance practitioners at various private and public sector organisations. These practitioners included most importantly Gian Piero Gina - Senior Legal Counsel at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Roger Barker at the Institute of Directors (IoD), and Daniel Daeniker, managing partner and corporate lawyer at the Swiss based law firm (Homburger). These exchanges have permitted the PI to share the insights from the research project with practitioners, to obtain their views on the issue of index construction and on measuring corporate governance - two key questions of the project. In the case of the EBRD, the PI has had a number of face-to-face discussions and e-mail exchanges with Mr. Gina about the new methodology of measuring the quality of governance via an EBRD survey. Mr. Gina has visited King's College London to present the EBRD's work on corporate governance to our MSc and BSc students. While these contacts have not yet led to any manifest impact, this is partly due to the fact that the nature of the project meant that the focus very much was on data collection during the duration of the grant. Nevertheless, establishing and developing these contacts will help the PI to disseminate the results from the project as they emerge and increase the chances of creating impact.

3. Most importantly, the PI has actively participated in a stakeholder initiative called 'The Purpose of the Corporation' run by the public interest law firm Frank Bold. This project brings together academics and practitioners to discuss the future of the corporate form and in particular problems associated with the notion of running corporations with the exclusive goal of creating shareholder value. Shareholder value being one of the key concepts of interest of the Law &amp;amp; Agency project, the involvement in the Frank Bold initiative has allowed the PI to participate in two roundtables where the insights from the Law &amp;amp; Agency project could directly be communicated and discussed with practitioners from countries included in the study. 

The first of these workshops took place in Zurich on October 29th, 2015 where the PI had the opportunity to establish contacts with practitioners of corporate governance in Switzerland - one of the countries studied - notably Dominik Biederman, head of Switzerland's main shareholder activist association Ethos. During the workshop, discussions took place in working groups, which provided the PI with the opportunity to present the project and talk about its key insights. 
The second workshop took place on February 15, 2016 at Nyenrode Business University in the Netherlands - another country included in the study. The topic of this workshop was dominated by the draft of the new Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which was released four days prior to the workshop. A member of the Dutch Corporate Governance committee was present at the workshop and the draft code was discussed at great length. Again, these discussions allowed the PI to share the insights of the project with practitioners and to contribute to Frank Bold's official response to the draft code. Indeed, several of the PI's remarks - based on insights from the Law &amp;amp; Agency project - will be included in the final report of the workshop, which will constitute an official response to the Code Committee's consultation procedure. The projects contribution to Frank Bold's response was notably important in terms of cautioning against an excessive focus on shareholder-orientation, but also in terms of putting the Dutch case into comparative context. The summary reports of the round tables, which took place under the Chatham House Rules, confirm that the results of the project have been used by Frank Bold and can be found here: http://www.purposeofcorporation.org/en#useful-resources 

In conclusion, the PI has undertaken considerable efforts to create impact through active interactions with practitioners and journalists throughout the duration of the project. However, it should be kept in mind that one constraint has been that the project was very largely focused on data collection and that the analysis of the data only started to take place in the later stages of the project. This means that the project could not yet develop its full impact. Nevertheless, the PI managed to generate very considerable interest among practitioners based on partial and provisional results emerging during the data collection process. The contacts that were established in this way will allow the PI to disseminate future results quickly and effectively and thus maximize the chances of creating measureable impact.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>712BEBD8-C59C-4269-ACEC-93D48C541E0E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main objective of this project outlined in the proposal was the creation of a longitudinal database, in order to investigating how legal reforms influence firm-level changes in corporate governance (CG) practices. As anticipated, given the ambitious nature of the research design (four countries, several hundred companies over two decades), the data collection lasted for the whole duration of the project. The main empirical results can therefore be expected to emerge over the coming months. Nevertheless, two key findings have already emerged.

Key finding 1: The sense and non-sense of CG indices

To achieve the objective of developing a shareholder orientation index (SOI), the existing commercial and academic CG indices (CGIs) have been reviewed. We found that virtually all existing CGIs, and authors using them, ignore issues of measurement reliability and validity, which are considered key criteria for good measurements in other disciplines. Therefore, rather than following existing methodologies of index creation - as originally planned -, the focus turned to improving the quality of CG measures. This involved a conceptual reflection on CG measurement and the search for the most appropriate methodology to create indices. The PI attended various statistical training courses. As a result of the statistical skills acquired, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) has been chosen as a promising methodology that can help create valid and reliable measurements based on the new dataset. SEM can also accommodate recent insights from the so-called 'bundles approach' into the interplay between CG mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes a completely novel approach to index construction in the field of CG.

A working paper entitled 'Measuring Corporate Governance: Lessons from the Bundles Approach' summarises this finding (Cambridge Centre for Business Research (CBR) working paper no. 438). It has been presented at the following conferences and institutions: Conference on National Corporate Governance Bundles, Judge Business School Cambridge; London Centre for Corporate Governance and Ethics; SOAS, University of London; Linnaeus University, Sweden.

As part of this line of research, the PI co-organised a panel on Bundles in CG Research, which was held at the University of Chicago during the 26th annual SASE conference and included: Prof. Christina Ahmadjian, Hitotsubashi University, Tokyo, Prof. William Judge, former editor in chief of Corporate Governance International Review (CGIR), and Prof. Thomas Clarke, University of Technology, Sydney. The panel allowed the PI to present the project to world-renowned CG scholars, benefit from their input, and engage in exchanges after the conference.

Key finding 2: The &amp;quot;Law &amp;amp; Finance&amp;quot; School's &amp;quot;thin&amp;quot; conceptualisation of law

A second key finding relates to the fundamental research question outlined in the research proposal: 'Does law matter for firm-level CG change?'

The literature review revealed that most empirical studies investigating whether 'law matters' are not based on any consistent conceptualization of the link between law and corporate outcomes. The Law &amp;amp; Finance School implicitly assumes that law impacts economic actors either through i) threats or ii) incentives. However, legal scholarship shows that these two channels are not the only ways in which law affects corporations. A second paper focuses on this issue. Drawing on fundamental legal theories, it suggests that legal theory needs to be taken more seriously and the above-mentioned channels need to be complemented by an additional one, i.e. the signalling of appropriate behaviour by the law.
This finding also has implications for empirical studies. It suggests that the research designs of existing studies are inappropriate, because they do not capture all possible effects of law on practices. The new data set will allow us to test more appropriate empirical strategies in the coming months.

The theoretical paper has been presented at the 1st annual conference of the World International Network for Institutional Research (WINIR); The WINIR Symposium on 'The Nature and Governance of the Corporation'; the 27th annual SASE Conference; and the workshop 'Corporate Governance: Theory, Reality, Policy', University of Hertfordshire.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The objectives have been met. Some parameters of the project had to be changed, however, due to data availability and methodological reasons. Thus, the number of companies for which data was collected has been increased from 40 to a target of 100 per country and year, as it was feared that otherwise the statistical analysis might not have generated sufficiently robust results. Conversely, due to the larger number of companies in the sample and to data availability issues, the number of variables that were collected has been reduced compared to the initial list of potentially interesting variables. Generally, speaking the data collection process was more challenging and time-consuming than anticipated, in part because of issues with the recruitment of appropriate research assistants.

The PI has presented the project to various possible end-users, including on several occasions to PIRC (Adam Rose) and Deloitte &amp;amp; Touch (Oleg Shvyrkov). The PI has also established regular contacts with the European Bank for Reconstruction &amp;amp; Development (EBRD). This involved meetings at the EBRD to present the project and a guest lecture at King's by Gian Piero Cigna, senior counsel at the EBRD. on related issued.
The practitioners were particularly interested in the measurement and methodological considerations, as well as the bundles approach, because many of them are aware of the limitations of existing CGIs methodologies and are eager to improve them.
At the academic level, the dataset constitutes an invaluable resource that can be further extended temporally and geographically and improved in terms of the comprehensiveness and completeness of the data. Together with Prof. Mathias Siems (Durham), the PI has written a grant application in order to extent the geographical scope of the current project to a larger number of countries. It will be submitted to a funding body in the near future. 
The PI is also designated co-investigator on a large grant application led by Prof Simon Deakin (Cambridge) that aims at extending the CBR Law, Finance, and Development programme to Low Income Countries. This would provide the opportunity for further extension of the present project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>408135FE-325D-4E87-92ED-BDFDBD0590A2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.gerhardschnyder.com/law-and-agency/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Mention in the report 'Corporate Governance for a Changing World' published by FrankBold in relation with 'The Purpose of the Corporation' project</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>29167CD3-2F40-4FCE-99CD-40551F719331</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.purposeofcorporation.org/corporate-governance-for-a-changing-world_report.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>'More Teeth Needed for Corporate Governance Reforms': Response to the Dept.
