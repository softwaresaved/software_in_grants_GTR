The goal of being able to develop software that can be formally verified as correct with respect to its intended behaviour is therefore highly desirable. The foundations of such formal verification have a long anddistinguished history, dating back over fifty years. What hasremained more elusive are scalable verification tools that can deal with the complexities of software systems.However, times are changing, as reflected by a current renaissance within the formal software verification community -- both in industryas well as academia. A significant recent development has been Separation Logic, a logic which promotes scalable reasoning forpointer programs. Pointers are a powerful and widely usedprogramming mechanism, but developing and maintaining correctpointer programs is notoriously hard. In terms of verification tools, the majority of effort has gone into developing light-weight analysis techniques for separation logic, such as shape analysis. Shape analysis ignores the contentof data, focusing instead on how data is structured. While such light-weight properties can be extremely valuable to industry,ultimately a more comprehensive level of specification is calledfor, i.e. correctness specifications. For instance, the verificationof software libraries against agreed correctness standards couldprove highly valuable across a wide range of sectors. However,to verify such comprehensive specifications requires more heavy-weight analysis, i.e. theorem proving. Our proposal focuses on the development of tools which willsupport the automatic verification of correctness specificationswithin separation logic. In particular, we will investigate how light- and heavy-weight approaches can be optimally combined. We propose a cooperative approach, in which individual techniques combine their strengths, but crucially compensate for each other's weaknesses through the communication of partial results and failures. To achieve this level of cooperation we will use a theorem proving technique called proof planning, which has a proven track-record in building cooperative reasoning tools. We plan to combine the proof planning approach with existing off-the-shelf shape analysis tools developed by Peter O'Hearn's research group at Queen Mary University (London). Note that our cooperative approach will also enhance the existing shape analysis tools, i.e. make the tools extensible and thus more widely applicable. If our cooperative style of integration is successful, then it could have a significant impact on reducing the cost of developing highly reliable software.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>304909</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Pointers are widely used in the construction of software systems,
they provide a powerful mechanism for storing and manipulating
data within programs. However, developing and maintaining correct
programs that use pointers is notoriously hard. Adopting an integrated
approach, our CORE (COoperative REasoning) project focused on the
challenge of verifying the correctness of pointer programs. Building
upon a relatively new and novel programming logic called separation logic,
we investigated the mechanisation of verification proofs for pointer
programs. Our goal was to develop techniques that support the automatic
verification of so called functional properties of pointer programs.
That is, proving that a program delivers correct results. This involves
reasoning about both the structure and content of the data, as well as
how it is manipulated during program execution. For a given functional
property, the construction of the verification proofs will typically
require the discovery of auxiliary properties, i.e. loop invariants
and frame invariants. Such properties can be seen as expressing the
inner workings of the program, and represent a major challenge to
automatic program proof. Our research directly addressed this challenge
by developing an integrated approach to automating proof search and
property discovery. We complement other research in this area, in
particular work on shape analysis which supports the verification of
structural properties of pointer programs. Specifically we used the
shape analysis work as the starting point for our research, and see
it as an integrated part of our approach. In terms of achievements,
the CORE Project:

+ Developed a proof search strategy which we call mutation. Based
 on a principle of difference reduction, the strategy was designed
 to handle the kinds of separation logic proof obligations which
 arise when reasoning about the functionality of pointer programs
 that involve iteration (loops) or recursion.

+ Developed a term synthesis technique for the automatic discovery of
 loop and frame invariants - properties that are essential when
 reasoning about programs that involve iteration and recursion
 respectively.

+ Developed the CORE planner, a light-weight planning engine that
 supports the application of proof strategies, such as mutation. The
 CORE planner is also designed to cooperate with term synthesis,
 shape analysis, proof checking and graph rewriting tools in order
 to support automatic functional verification.

+ Developed a prototype visualizer which allows us to graphically
 animate the execution of pointer programs specified in separation
 logic. While this was not part of our original work plan, it proved
 to be a very useful aid to debugging programs as well as an effective
 interface to separation logic.

+ Evaluated our integrated approach to automating the verification
 of functional properties on a set of examples drawn in part from the
 publicly available Smallfoot (shape analysis) corpus. Given that
 Smallfoot focuses purely on shape, we added functional specifications
 in the form of pre- and postconditions. We also explored challenge
 examples from the literature, such as the &amp;quot;frying pan&amp;quot; example.

As well as the CORE system, we produced four refereed international workshop
papers, and have a journal paper and a conference papers currently under
review. During the CORE Project our research generated interest with ITI 
Techmedia, a Scottish Government sponsored technology transfer agency. Through 
a Software Integrity Engineering programme, we secured three ITI consultancy 
contracts which involved us in exploring the automatic verification of array 
bound properties within the Java programming language, and resulted in the 
development of a proof-of-concept prototype analysis tool. This was applied 
research, and while informed by our CORE Project, was quite distinct.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our approach complements the work of other verification researchers that are working on separation logic.
