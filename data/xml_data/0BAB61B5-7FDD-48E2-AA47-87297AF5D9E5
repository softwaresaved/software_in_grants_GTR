The convergence of nanotechnology, information technologies and biotechnology is widely predicted to lie at the heart of the next technological revolution. Nano-info-bio science and technology has the potential to fundamentally transform healthcare, agriculture, energy, security, environmental science and many other areas of pressing concern. MMU is ideally placed to take advantage of and contribute to these developments. We have a strong research presence in each of nanoscience, informatics and biosciences. However, while the relevant groups carry out internationally-renowned work in their own domains, there has been, so far, little cross-fertilization between certain communities.Our programme will stimulate activities at the interfaces of nano-info-bio, initially drawing on members of the Dalton Research Institute (DRI) and the Institute for Biomedical Research into Human Movement and Health (IRM). The IRM has recently relocated to the main University campus, and the proposed programme will provide an ideal vehicle for creating entirely new institutional partnerships. We therefore seek to build (and strengthen) links between computational scientists/mathematicians/engineers and their counterparts in the natural/life/health sciences. We propose a grass-roots programme of fine-grained project support that will maximise opportunity for involvement and encourage serendipitous contact between different disciplines. By operating within a challenge-driven framework, we will drive the programme to produce tangible outcomes and lay the foundations for long-term sustainability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>289095</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Manchester Digital Laboratory</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Manchester DIYbio</gtr:description><gtr:id>96850935-5CED-4B23-93E8-954E2610184F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NIB directly led to the creation of an entirely new organisation. DIYBIO Manchester (DIYBIOMCR) is now an established independent entity, the UK's largest &amp;quot;do it yourself&amp;quot; biology group, and is an active participant in the global DIYbio movement. For a full list of relevant DIYBIOMCR activities, please see http://www.scmdt.mmu.ac.uk/cir/REF/cs2.html . Relevant projects included the Manchester Microbe Map (a bacterial &amp;quot;atlas&amp;quot; of bus stops in Manchester), and the construction of &amp;quot;homebrew&amp;quot; DNA replication equipment.

As a result of the project, the turnover of MadLab (the parent organization) has grown significantly,and, since 2011, an average of 80% of MadLab's income has been due to DIYBIOMCR. The MadLab finance manager provided the following figures on 14/11/13: predicted income
for 2013-14: &amp;pound;330,000, of which &amp;pound;228,000 (69%) is directly attributable to DIYBIOMCR.

A deposition from MadLab Director states that &amp;quot;DIYBIOMCR has brought much positive attention to MadLab, and exposed the organization to a wide range of new audiences. We have become much more outward-facing, as opposed to focusing on community groups and in-house training. At the time, the Wellcome Trust funding was MadLab's largest single block of external money, and represented its most significant external relationship with another organization. This seed-corn money, in turn, gave access to more funding, and allowed MadLab to present itself in a different light to external bodies. To put it bluntly, the Wellcome Trust &amp;quot;seal of approval&amp;quot; gave MadLab a significant &amp;quot;cachet&amp;quot;, on which we have since built. MadLab is now in the process of converting into a Community Interest Company, and we have separately raised &amp;pound;160K of the &amp;pound;250K we need to refurbish our space. Much of the money raised has come from local and national sources that have been developed and nurtured as a direct result of DIYBIOMCR.&amp;quot;

In recent years the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has developed a DIY bio program that aims to share information and make connections between amateur scientists and local law enforcement officers. The objective is to address any concerns (on either side of the regulatory &amp;quot;fence&amp;quot;), and to provide a framework for ongoing discussions. The Bureau's local Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) coordinators are the focal point of such conversations, and ensure that local authorities (e.g., fire and police service, environmental health) are informed of the nature and location of cooperating DIY biology laboratories. The FBI also works closely with the Department of State on biosecurity, and the Department of Health and Human services on biosafety.

As a result of our high-profile activities, the FBI invited DIYBIOMCR participants Asa Calow and Rachel Turner to attend a workshop held in San Francisco on 12-14/6/2012; Calow and Turner were the only UK-based participants in attendance, and they were specifically invited as a direct consequence of the outcomes of DIYBIOMCR. The purpose of the workshop was to &amp;quot;educate the FBI about biology&amp;quot; (in the context of the growing DIY biology movement), and to &amp;quot;foster the positive relationship among FBI, DIYbio, amateur biology and local stakeholder communities to ensure safe conduct in science.&amp;quot; The FBI explicitly stated that &amp;quot;we want to model this for the international community...&amp;quot; (that is, they want to help to develop policy and practice, both within the US and beyond). Their explicit aim is to help to avoid extra regulation of DIYbio scientists &amp;quot;that hinders their abilities to push scientific progress. Ultimately, it will be up to the communities themselves how they wish to operate, and the FBI will continue to work with them to further their efforts.&amp;quot; 

A subsequent email (27/7/2012) to Calow and Turner from an FBI supervisory special agent with the FBI Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Directorate in Washington DC stated that &amp;quot;I wanted to thank you again for agreeing to come and present at the event ... Your perspective on media issues was delivered so well that I believe that a great impact was left [on] the attendees ... It really left a great impression on me that some direction and reinforcement is being given to this community in proactively engaging the media, to their ultimate benefit.&amp;quot;

A later message (10/6/2013) to Prof. Amos from the FBI Special Agent (about the DIYBIOMCR contribution) stated that &amp;quot;their insight, engagement within their community and energy makes them, in my eyes, a leader in being a proactive member of the amateur biology community... These steps take a long time to climb, but it seems as if they have been very successful in developing a working model that serves their community. Additionally, Rachel's input regarding interactions with the media have kept this issue in high standing for our future events with this community.&amp;quot;

The total immediate (in-person) audience reached was around 700 for DIYBIOMCR. Results were disseminated widely, and though high-profile channels such as pieces (both 28/3/2012) on the main BBC Ten-o-clock News (estimated viewing figure: 4.75M) and Radio 4's Today programme (average weekly audience of around 7M).

Naomi Jacobs started by relating the aims and achievements of the NIB project, and giving an overview of some of the re- search being done in the Early Adopter and large projects. Lindsey Munro then gave a fascinating talk explaining the nature of computational chemistry, and work being done as an Early Adopter project designing novel nanodevices.
