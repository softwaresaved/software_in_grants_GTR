Detailed reconstruction of lead-lag relationships in different regions provides important information about causal links between regions in the context of global climate change. Here we use an annually laminated sediment core from Lake Suigetsu, Japan, to examine timings and rates of key abrupt climate changes across the Lateglacial and early Holocene (i.e. the timeframe from the end of the last glacial into the present warm period) using a high resolution (5-10 year) molecular record of autochthonous (within-lake) and catchment responses to change, and precipitation/evaporation variations at this site. A series of abrupt climate changes from the Lateglacial-Holocene has been intensively studied worldwide and several opposing theories proposed. Earlier studies tended to support synchrony of climate changes between remote regions whereas recent studies in the West Pacific and Antarctica report climate changes that are asynchronous to those in the North Atlantic. In monsoon Asia, it has also been suggested that a cooling period that interrupted the warming at the onset of the Holocene in Asia was triggered by North Atlantic ocean circulation changes whereas a more recent study of Greenland ice argues that monsoon changes started slightly earlier in Asia than in the North Atlantic. Previous research by the Co-I using pollen data to reconstruct past vegetation and temperature at Lake Suigetsu reported a substantial delay in this cooling onset in Japan and suggested a combined role of North Atlantic circulation and solar forcing as the main drivers of millennial to centennial scale monsoon climate changes. Chinese stalagmite records suggest a period of cooling around 8200 years ago (the 8.2 ka event) has synchronous changes to evidence for cooling detected in Greenland ice core data but this hypothesis needs to be checked using records from other regions, including Japan. Difficulties in studying relative event timings lie in (i) high-precision age determination and (ii) response time in proxies for change. Lake Suigetsu is an ideal site for high-precision age determination because the sediment core to be analysed is extremely well radiocarbon dated. For the latter point, pollen has been the only climate proxy data generated from the Lake Suigetsu core and while pollen is sufficient to discuss multi-decadal to centennial scale changes, abrupt (inter-annual to decadal) changes are more difficult because of relatively slow response times of vegetation to climate changes. Biomarkers ('chemical fossils') can be used to provide information on past environments via evidence for changes in source inputs, productivity and, more recently (via the use of isotope ratios analysed in specific compounds) changes in temperature and precipitation/evaporation. Biomarker analysis will be employed here to reconstruct timings and rates of changes in source inputs, productivity (reflecting lake biota responses to change), temperature and precipitation, providing complimentary and additional information to that provided by pollen data. This research will contribute to (i) understanding the nature and mechanism of decadal to centennial climate changes, and (ii) providing a precise and accurate chronology for deglacial to Holocene event boundaries. An important result will be the timing of the Holocene onset in Lake Suigetsu. While Greenland ice is used to determine the timing of the Holocene onset via counting annual ice layers, there is a lack of suitable fossils preserved in ice that can be dated by radiocarbon. Lake Suigetsu, however, will be dated by radiocarbon using a large number of terrestrial plant leaf remains as well as counting of annual layers in the sediment.The results will be of significant interest and benefit to the scientific community of geologists and climatologists.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91644</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>COPACSO Coalition for Pastoral Civil Society Organizations</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Uganda, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>A89986F6-DA6D-49C6-84D0-1229F825B348</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Continued and expanding collaboration with academics has also led to grant applications (including biomarker, CSI-dD and pollen analysis) to extend the Lake Suigetsu 2006 project to the next phase, which focuses on global palaeoclimate correlation at the decadal to millennial scale across the 73.5m (~150,000 year) Suigetsu core.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Academic collaboration with academic users on an international level.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project has led to substantial academic collaboration with academic users on an international level.

used biomarker analysis, compound specific isotope analysis of deuterium/hydrogen (CSI-_D) of n-alkanoic acids, and pollen analysis to examine evidence of environmental and climatic change using sediments from Lake Suigetsu, Japan, with a focus on the late glacial cold reversal (LGCR, equivalent to the Younger Dryas; c. 12.8-11.6 cal. BP) and 8.2ka event. 

Biomarker and CSI-_D analyses were carried out at decadal (1cm) to centennial (8cm) resolution. Pollen analysis was carried out at decadal (1cm) or sub-decadal (0.5cm) resolution.

Biomarker compositions of a wide range of organic compounds (e.g. n-alkanoic acids, n-alkanes, sterols, hopanoids) were used to identify changes in productivity and organic inputs (e.g. algal, bacterial, catchment) and provide evidence of changing aquatic communities and limnological conditions as a response to climate change. CSI-dD data provides evidence for shifts in moisture balance. 

We also constructed a total organic carbon (TOC) calibration dataset (~400 samples) to quantitatively reconstruct sediment TOC content using Fourier-transform near-infra-red spectroscopy (FTNIRS) and elemental analysis. Our calibration, which is capable of reconstructing TOC at annual resolution, will be invaluable in future detailed studies of TOC within the Lake Suigetsu core.

This is the first biomarker dataset obtained from Lake Suigetsu and provides novel information across significant periods of Quaternary and Holocene climate change.

Key results show (i) the onset of the late glacial cold reversal in Japan was synchronous to the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD) in Greenland. The onset is represented by shifts in diatom communities (as found by project partners) and also, prior to this, by shifts in biomarkers and CSI-dD indicative of more humid conditions and enhanced catchment soil inwash, (ii) several different phases have been recognised within the YD, with biomarker and pollen data highlighting a mid-YD change which we will investigate further, (iii) the Holocene onset occurred over several decades with no clear evidence for lead/lag between pollen and other proxies and was synchronous in Japan and Greenland, (iv) biomarker (and other proxy) data show evidence of changing aquatic communities and increased episodes of inwash and storminess around 8.2ka but pollen-derived temperatures did not fluctuate significantly.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This grant does not have a Pathways to Impact statement as it was awarded before Pathways to Impact statements were introduced. 
However, the listed beneficiaries of the project are: the (i) climate modelling community which needs reliable high-resolution proxy data of rates and relative timings of abrupt climate changes as the validation dataset, (ii) palaeoclimatology community and policy makers who need to understand the nature and mechanism of climate changes which take place on timescales shorter than the human lifetime, and (iii) Quaternary and geology community which needs a precise and accurate chronology for the Holocene onset.
This research focussed on using multiproxy and novel molecular techniques to reconstruct changes in climate at high resolution across significant periods of climate change at the end of the last glacial period using the lake sediment record from a key site in monsoon Asia. The research outcomes may be taken forward in particular by the above beneficiaries and others interested in understanding high resolution timings of abrupt climate change and impacts on the environment.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7FE7BE14-7117-4BE5-8090-AF67823D2E4A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.suigetsu.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication
