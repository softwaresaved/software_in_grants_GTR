initiatives in Africa: Tanzania's wildlife Management Areas (PIMA)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/L00139X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Rural people across the global south are caught between competing land demands for large-scale cultivation, global conservation, and local needs. These can in theory be integrated locally through community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) and payments for ecosystem services (PES): where communities can decide on and benefit directly from natural resources, they may invest in and manage those resources in ways that are more socially and environmentally sustainable. CBNRM/PES initiatives are being rolled out across the global south, but there are conflicting views as to how well they work, for whom and under what circumstances. This is partly due to the complexity and multidimensionality of the ecosystem services (ES) and poverty alleviation (PA) outcomes involved, and the inevitable tradeoffs, but also to the hitherto limited use of either qualitatively or quantitatively rigorous impact evaluation approaches that are independent, control for confounding factors and ensure the voices of the most marginalized are heard. As well as being limited by generally weak research design, studies to date have often failed to account for the ways political sensitivities around changing access to and use of ecosystem services may compromise data quality and mask differentiated impacts.

PIMA seizes a unique policy moment, with Tanzania's poverty reduction strategy Mkukuta driving nationwide implementation of CBNRM/PES-based Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs), and other countries in the region considering comparable initiatives. The WMAs comprise different ecosystems (rangeland, miombo), socio-political structures (long-established/ethnically uniform vs recent, heterogeneous constituent villages), and a broad range of ecosystem services (water-regulating and -supplying, provision of forest products, grazing, livestock, crop and wildlife production, cultural services both local and global (from locally significant social and ritual spaces, to heritage and tourism). Before/after, inside/outside comparison of social and ecological outcomes for established WMAs with matched non-WMA areas (within the same ecosystems) offers an ideal opportunity for rigorous impact evaluation. PIMA combines analysis of remotely-sensed, public-domain MODIS and NDVI data, with cutting edge study of governance, and new data from qualitatively and quantitatively rigorous, differentiated survey of livelihoods and resource use histories, structured within a before/after, control/impact (BACI) research design. PIMA brings together a powerful international research team to work with strongly-rooted civil society organizations to ensure research excellence and development impact.

Building on ongoing stakeholder engagement, with input sought from users, practitioners and policymakers at all stages pre- to post-project, PIMA ensures findings will be of direct use locally, nationally and internationally. PIMA 's framework and approach create channels for grassroots users to make experienced change in ecosystem services quality and quantity, and in poverty and wellbeing, more clearly heard by policymakers and practitioners, as well as highlighting tradeoffs and best practice lessons. Establishing what works, why and for whom will be of use not only to the one million rural people directly affected by WMAs, but will deliver insights and best practice lessons generalizable to the many millions more whose livelihoods and wellbeing are to be shaped by comparable CBNRM/PES initiatives. The findings delivered, and the mechanisms piloted, will give local users and national and international policymakers and practitioners the insights and tools to improve interventions through creating better upward and downward accountability. PIMA findings will be of use locally to rural people making collective and individual resource use decisions, through national levels, to international donors deciding how to invest scarce resources for ecosystem services and poverty alleviation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>PIMA research findings will improve ecosystem services/ poverty alleviation (ES/PA) interventions by establishing what works, why and for whom in a central test case. PIMA will improve upward and downward accountability by creating ways for grassroots users to make clear their experience of intervention-associated changes in ES quality and quantity, poverty and wellbeing, and associated tradeoffs, and by giving policymakers, practitioners and donors the insights and tools to improve interventions. 

PIMA's intended beneficiaries include: 
(a) poor local people in the case study sites. WMAs already impact directly on one million rural people in Tanzania, and new WMAs in various stages of planning and implementation will affect a further 1.5 million rural Tanzanians. PIMA insights and best practice lessons will be generalizable to people in the many comparable ES/PA schemes being rolled out across the region and across the global south 
(b) implementing organizations: PIMA is independent from but networked with NGO implementers involved in study WMAs, while other (non-study) WMA and CBNRM interveners/ practitioners participating in PIMA workshops include a wide range of NGOs (WWF, AWF, JBG/WCST, DHA, Africare, FZS, FarmAfrica) who operate internationally, and are keen to make interventions more effective 
(c) researchers exploring the interplay of ecosystem services and poverty alleviation in East Africa and across the global south 
(d) national/ global policy-makers, practitioners, donors, and the wider ESPA network 
(e) investors including East Africa tour operating companies, carbon, REDD+ and other PES scheme entrepreneurs.

PIMA will clarify WMA impacts on ES-based livelihoods, tradeoffs, and their implications, making more clear the needs and priorities of poor people using savanna and miombo woodland ecosystems, and the feedback loops that transmit pressures on poor populations back to the ES on which they depend. PIMA will support poor people's livelihoods by making WMA-associated changes in their wellbeing visible to national and international policymakers and practitioners, making it easier for them to identify appropriate policy/governance structures to encourage socially and environmentally sustainable outcomes. Donors and investors will use PIMA findings to ensure their resources are invested to best effect, and in demonstrably ethical ways. Research into use thus builds on engagement of, feedback from, dissemination through and uptake by the networks of users outlined above. PIMA findings are likely to reveal a range of tradeoffs, as a result of WMA impacts on distribution of ES benefits among different groups (by age, sex, wealth and residential status), of differential outcomes on quality and quality of different ES, and on ES at the expense of PA or vice versa. Development partners will need to facilitate mechanisms for equitable, socially and environmentally sustainable compromises with respect to such tradeoffs; the ESPA Directorate will need to disseminate the working compromises attained. 

South researchers will integrate their in-depth local knowledge into, and influence development of, new conceptual frameworks around socio-ecological processes. They will be exposed to new scientific and research funding and management skills. North researchers will learn from African partners' in-depth local social and ecological knowledge and expertise in developing work that is locally credible and relevant. Dovetailing North scientific and technical capacity with South expertise and local knowledge delivers impact greater than the sum of the individual parts. Western science is built in part on models evolved in more temperate social-ecological systems, not always appropriate for understanding sub/tropical systems. Local ecological knowledge not only increasingly informs emerging scientific models but gives insights relevant to increasingly unpredictable and variable contexts in UK and worldwide.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>464822</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>TanSat (CarbonSat) mission</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Kenya Rangelands Coalition</gtr:description><gtr:id>D6F461D3-39EA-4E52-A022-651F22F2CBD2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>information flow; dissemination to and feedback from user groups</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Participation in project meetings ensure communication, dissemination and feedback with this user network

PIMA addressed three interlinked dimensions of WMA impacts: the nature, quantity and quality of ecosystem services benefits WMAs deliver; governance of ecosystem service benefits in terms of access and distribution; and resource use histories demonstrating effects of WMAs on livelihoods, poverty and wellbeing. We used a before/after, control/impact research design which makes it possible to pick apart changes due to the presence of a WMA, as opposed to other confounding factors. Key findings show:
2. 
3. - These are very variable environments and the 7-year period from WMA inception to our review is insufficient to show clear directional changes in habitat or biodiversity ecosystem services.
4. - The frequency of consumption of domestic animal and bushmeat taken together is not significantly affected by WMAs, and shows a divergent pattern with (non-significant) positive effects in the south WMAs, and (non-significant) negative effects in the north. However, when the two types of meat are considered separately, north WMAs exert a significant positive effect on frequency of bushmeat consumption, and south WMAs a significant negative effect. The magnitude of the WMA-related decrease in the south is about half that of the WMA-related increase in the north. Although we have no formal evidence for this, it is possible that trophy hunting in the north is increasing and that the meat is distributed or sold in the communities whereas WMAs in the south generally have not seen a similar interest from investors (perhaps due to poor access and less visitor interest). It is also possible that South WMAs may have begun to exert increased control of illegal hunting, reducing the availability of bushmeat in the South communities. The combined result for both types of meat suggests that South people have increased domestic animal meat consumption through time, although the BACI effect is not significant. Further analysis is comparing these results to trends (including counterfactual trends) in tropical livestock equivalents owned per adult equivalent, and in the wildlife density overflight data

While there are few clear WMA-related changes in ecosystem services, there were clear social and economic changes:-
5. - Change in wealth rank 2007-2014 for households in the highest-earning North WMA Burunge is clearly worse than for their matched non-WMA controls irrespective of wealth ranking in 2007. Moderate earner Enduimet (North) and non-earning South WMA households have benefitted relative to their matched controls. In the South WMAs this appears due to philanthropic interventions independent of these WMAs (see below)
6. - Change in wealth rank 2007-2014 for WMA households with at least one member in a village game scout role (generally chosen from poorer households) is clearly better than for their matched non-WMA controls. The concentration of WMA management and committee positions among rich households suggests that WMA governance facilitates capture of opportunities by those involved in management
7. - Overall, households in Burunge (the WMA with the highest tourism revenue) appear - paradoxically - to have lost out from WMA creation; while households in WMAs with less or no tourism revenue appear to have benefitted. This counterintuitive finding is thought to result from the opportunity costs of WMA restrictions; from state and WMA top-slicing of WMA revenue, which may make CBNRM into a punitive rural taxation system for WMAs earning revenue; by contrast conservation NGOs' philanthropic efforts have achieved some positive change in WMAs with no tourism revenue. Elite capture where revenues are high is also a possible factor.
8. - Household-level livelihoods data show that change in access to key resources (grazing, firewood, construction materials) 2007-2014, and changes in crop damage during that time, are clearly worse for WMA than non-WMA control households
9. - Detailed analysis for changes in women's wellbeing focused on the competing hypotheses (1) that as pro-poor, community based natural resource management initiatives with a focus on women's empowerment, WMAs would improve the position of Tanzanian rural women; or conversely (2) that as commonly poorer and more marginalised members of these societies, women's access to resources, ability to use those resources, and the significance of that access and use to women as individuals and as members of society, would all be adversely impacted by WMAs. PIMA findings are clearly consistent with the second hypothesis.
- WMA governance is characterised by lack of meaningful inclusion and participation in relevant decision-making processes pertaining to WMA establishment (to do it or not, to join a WMA or not), WMA design (land use planning and zoning; devising a regime of rules, regulations, restrictions; revenue collection, sharing and expenditure), and WMA management (elite capture, weak accountability to
