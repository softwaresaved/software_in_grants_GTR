Based on work by HSF and KU, later developed with MMU, this project considers models to maximise the impact of such archives.

Funded by Creativeworks London, LOTO mobilised HSF's unique archive collections via research, digitisation, education and exhibition. Hub funding restricted activities to London; extending impact beyond London is a key project aim. We will test the feasibility of mobilising creative SME archive holdings for public education and unforeseen economic applications via knowledge exchange, public engagement and dissemination activities in Leeds, London and Manchester. This scales up lessons learnt during LOTO, develops new audiences, and applies knowledge gained to other archives and young creative practitioners. Activities include:

1. Student archives workshops in Leeds, London and Manchester

A series of inter-disciplinary archive workshop sessions hosted at University of Leeds, MMU and KU will use examples from HSF archives and draw on archive pedagogic theory to construct material creative tasks relevant to practitioners. The workshops test previously piloted ideas on art and design pedagogy with wider audiences. Transferable session plans devised from the workshops will enable ideas to be applied elsewhere. Parallel sessions in Leeds, Manchester and Kingston will document differences in student approaches to tasks in northern and London art schools and encourage dialogue across student bodies via blogging, social media and video conferencing.

2. Connecting with creative archives concerned with material objects and creative industry

Issues addressed by HSF's archives are similar to other archive collections nationwide. The project will construct beneficial knowledge exchange and network activity with small creative archives such as Kingston School of Art Archives, Man Met Special Collections, and Constance Howard Textile Archives at Goldsmiths University. We will establish a network of SMEs, academics and archives sharing interest in mobilising archive collections for educational, commercial and public engagement purposes. Exchanging archival strategies across organisations will benefit creative economy by generating opportunities for dissemination and collaboration. A symposium exploring issues for small archives and SMEs with personal archives will enable us to disseminate findings nationwide.

3. Fostering sustainable approaches to archiving with young creative professionals

Project researchers and HSF will mentor recent graduates from Leeds, MMU and KU who share practical concerns aligned to HSF's core approaches. Mentoring will develop techniques for the creation, mobilisation and exploitation of creative archives - offering expertise in SME operation, archives research and development and use of archives in contemporary creative practice. Developing a dialogue-led exploration of past creativity, mentoring will lead to a public exhibition co-hosted across university partners. The mentoring process will result in new advisory documents for recent graduates detailing best practice for developing archives to maximise commercial and cultural impact.

4. Archiving collaborative processes

Projects documented in LOTO were often collaboratively developed by HSF with external partners. These connections offer an opportunity to develop techniques that consider multiple authorship of archive content. The project will contact past creative partners to achieve this.

5. Feasibility study on archive-based commercial products

The possibility for future commercial applications from creative SME archives requires more investigation. We will examine the potential for web-based and mobile app design drawing on archives to create future products. Follow-on funding enables us to develop concepts, consult with production companies and construct a HSF archive website to enable this.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has very clear academic as well as economic and societal impacts. The main beneficiaries are viewed as:

- Students in creative art and design disciplines, especially whose work is 'born digital'
- Recent graduates in art and design commencing careers in SMEs or establishing their own SMEs
- Creative SMEs with archival holdings that are underdeveloped or at risk
- Institutional archives wishing to engage with the creative SME sector
- Academics using archives and archive-based pedagogies

Creative practitioners in SMEs seeking to maximise utility of their archival holdings will benefit from networking activity that seeks to foster conversation around creative SME archives and feasibility reports into commercial mobilisation. HSF are a primary beneficiary, as a creative SME who aim to cement an influential role within the wider community. The project will empower HSF to effectively utilise their significant archival holdings in the future, for educative, cultural and public engagement purposes. Academics researching creative economy and archives will benefit from the case study activities produced. This will include exhibition material, as well as feasibility reports and lesson plans, and online published material. Students at the three connected universities will benefit from enhanced teaching delivered in focused workshop sessions based on creative industry issues with archives. Graduates from the three universities will benefit from in-depth mentoring on archive issues from academics and creative industry professionals involved with the project. Wider public audiences will be addressed via public engagement activities including public exhibitions at each of the three sites.

Specific impact derived from this project will include:

1. More artists, designers and creative SMEs building and valuing their archives

Workshop and mentoring activities will disseminate best practice around archives, encouraging young creative professionals to better mobilise their past archives of work. Direct communication with practitioners and the chance to showcase archival holdings via the planned exhibitions offer opportunities for further development. Student participants in the project will gain an enhanced understanding of archival methods and techniques appropriate to their practice, leading to improved future archival practices within creative SMEs.

2. Increased and enhanced use of archival examples from creative SMEs in teaching

Our project offers, via 3 host institutions, to foster a greater understanding among student participants of the practicalities of creative SME operation and issues, a wider appreciation of archiving and its value to creative practice, and the development of connections within student thinking between theoretical and creative responses to the archive. A curriculum plan will inscribe these practices for future use beyond the life of the project.

3. Encouraging scrutiny of creative SME archival practice in future research 

The establishment of a network on creative SME archives, a symposium, and a journal special issue will encourage further research into creative SME archives, by connecting a range of creative SMEs, small archives, and academics through discussion of archival holdings and practices. We will create a focal point for a community of interest assembled around creative SMEs, recording the results of debates and discussions, and enabling continuing processes of knowledge exchange beyond the life of the project

4. Offering long-term solutions that strengthen the creative economy via archival practice and mobilisation

We will offer case studies, examples of best practice and tailored advice for creative SMEs in the use of archives that could have lasting economic benefits to these businesses. The project will scope uses for creative SME archives, considering their creative, cultural, educative and commercial potential and benefits for the creative economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82879</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P013368/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9DD86EE2-EE6B-432E-AEE0-0C8669A1CBB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library &amp; information studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C96AF50D-AD7C-4C61-A30E-B8619DB33BAA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archives</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
