Additive manufacturing will use metallic powders which are laser sintered. The unused powder can cause issues if it is retained in the manufactured product and compromise the performance of the heat exchangers. Vibration is used to remove the unused powder from the system. In order to design the optimum vibration response of the product to remove this powder it is essential to be able to understand the vibration characteristics of the product and this will be the key role that ASDEC will undertake for the project.

The Advanced Structural Dynamics Evaluation Centre (ASDEC) of the University of Leicester is a unique facility for measuring vibration of complex components and structures by non-contact methods. ASDEC has world leading systems and capability in the measurement, assessment and analysis of vibration. Critically for this project, we have the ability to measure surface vibration in a non-contact and non-distructive manner up to 1MHz. ASDEC combines the combination of a Robovib system, LMS Modal Analysis and Virtual Correlation tools and a portable laser vibrometry system that can be used in the manufacturing environment. The 3D laser vibrometry equipment will allow repeatable measurements to be performed in unparalleled detail and accuracy on the complex structures that will be produced by our project partners. These measurements would be unachievable using other measurement techniques. 

Modal analysis of the vibration of the components will be used to optimise the powder shake-out and therefore allow for optimisation of the manufacturing routes. Additive manufacturing is highly attractive as it allows structures and architectures for products that are unachievable by conventional manufacturing routes. In addition to the capability of the ASDEC facility, the key staff have 40 years combined experience in vibration and acoustic engineering and development as well as signal processing and analysis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of the project is to optimise the production of heat exchangers by additive manufacturing routes and optimise the removal of loose powders that can impede performance. Additive manufacturing processes to make heat exchangers use metallic powders that are layered to produce the product design. The metallic powders are laser sintered to give the required mechanical performance of the product. If there is any unused powder retained in the product, it can cause issues if it is retained in the manufactured product and compromise the performance of the heat exchangers. Vibration is usually used to remove the unused powder from the system. In order to design the optimum vibration response of the product to remove this powder it is essential to be able to understand the vibration characteristics of these complex product.

The worldwide metal additive manufacturing market was worth $1.7bn in 2012 and this market is estimated to quadruple by 2022. Our project partners HiETA are developing products for mobility, energy, aerospace and defence and sporting goods markets. The targeted market for selective laser melting components for HiETA is 10% of the the EU SUV/off-road, sport, luxury, upper medium and medium market sectors over 10 years (which accounts for 26% of EU car production, or about 3.4 mn vehicles in 2010). Their target for heat exchangers is 250 units by the end of 2018 growing to 50,000 unit pa.
 
The results of our research will be of significant value to the UK additive manufacturing industry. Initially, the results will be used by project partners Heita and McLaren who will benefit from being able to optimise their manufacturing processes. The dissemination of the project will subsequently further benefit any other companies who use additive manufacturing for producing high specification products. The use of laser vibrometry for optimising powder shake-out will potentially benefit companies for more lean manufacturing where waste is less of an issue and also for minimising cost because they are not losing unused powder or using unnecessary material. Unused powder in a heat exchanger causes reduced thermal performance and therefore it is critical to optimise the production routes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>72663</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P03280X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FA25733D-A456-4A1B-9D5C-7119577368D9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufacturing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBD3B7F-5022-4513-82D6-5414B965FAB3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufacturing Machine &amp; Plant</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
