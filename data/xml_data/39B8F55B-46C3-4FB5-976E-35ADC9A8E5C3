It is the commonest cause of physical disability worldwide. In stroke patients with weakness, increasing activity in parts of the brain normally involved in producing movement helps recovery. The most effective way of achieving this is through practice, as if learning a new skill. In some patients this can be difficult if the weakness is too great. Brain imaging studies point to a possible way around the problem. We know that observing a movement increases activity in parts of the brain normally used to perform the same movement, which itself can help the observer to learn new skills. In other words, asking stroke patients to watch hand movements (known as ?action observation?) shortly before practicing the same movement during physiotherapy might improve recovery of their own hand.
However, some stroke patients might have damage to brain regions necessary for action observation to work. Even if not the case, the brain may not react in the same way when a patient is watching a movement that has been lost or impaired for a long time, which will reduce the chances of successful treatment. 
The aim of this study is to investigate how observing actions might work in stroke patients and to work out which types of patients are most likely to benefit. 
I will ask patients and healthy volunteers to watch a series of reaching movements ending in either a whole hand grasp or pinch and will assess the effects of observing these actions in two ways.
(1) Firstly, I will measure brain activity using modern brain imaging techniques. 
(2) Secondly, I will see if action observation makes it is easier for the brain to send signals to hand muscles, using safe non-invasive painless magnetic pulses (called ?transcranial magnetic stimulation?) applied to the surface of the head. 
I expect to find that action observation is effective at increasing brain activity and signals to hand muscles early after stroke, but less so several months later when the ?memory? of that movement has been lost from the brain. If so, I want to see whether a week of training (watching videos showing reaching movements for 30 minutes twice daily) can bring that memory back.
The results of this study will tell us who is most likely to benefit from the treatment and how soon after stroke it should be used.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Observing the actions of others promotes motor learning and exerts a strong influence over activity in the human motor system through premotor and parietal brain regions. Studies in primates suggest that these regions contain ?mirror neurons?, which are active during both the performance of a motor task and observation of the same task performed by another. 
Consequently, there is interest in using action observation as a tool to promote motor recovery after stroke. Action observation can increase motor output to the appropriate muscles by increasing the influence of premotor-parietal regions on primary motor cortex. However, observing actions may not have the same effect in all patients. Firstly, damage to the premotor-parietal network may impede responses. Secondly, preliminary data suggests that responses to observing impaired actions (e.g. pinch) are diminished in comparison to observing preserved actions (e.g. grasp) in chronic stroke patients. The variability in response to action observation needs to be understood before clinical trials can be designed optimally. I will investigate the effects of lesion site, level of impairment and time since stroke on the neuroimaging and neurophysiological markers of action observation. 
This proposal aims to investigate how widely applicable the principle of action observation treatment is after stroke. In the first study I will ask control volunteers and stroke patients at 2-4 weeks and after 6 months post-stroke to watch a series of videos showing reaching movements ending in either whole hand grasp or finger-thumb pinch of an object. During action observation I will:
1. Measure the change in corticospinal excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). 
2. Measure brain activation in premotor-parietal regions as well their influence on primary motor cortex activity using functional MRI.
I predict that responsiveness to action observation will be preserved in the post-acute phase unless there is extensive damage to the premotor-parietal regions. In the chronic phase I predict that action observation responsiveness will be lost for those actions which are impaired.
In the second study I will investigate whether responses to action observation (assessed with TMS and functional MRI) can be retrained in chronic patients who appear to be ?action observation unresponsive? by prolonged exposure to action observation treatment.
The results of this study will have implications for how to use action observation as a tool for promoting upper limb motor recovery, which types of patients are most likely to benefit, and the optimal timing (post-acute or chronic) of such an intervention.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>427056</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Imagery in recovery of movement after stroke</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>053CB8A4-9AAF-42B4-9E78-5EF10A2EB0AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I participated in 3 workshops exploring the role of 'Imagery in recovery of movement after stroke'. This was a collaboration between my research group (because of our interest in action observation), clinicians from the neurorehabilitation unit at The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, Rosetta Life, The Place (dance studio) and stroke patients and carers.

As a result of these workshops, Lucinda Jarrett (Rosetta Life) together with dancers from The Place came to work with stroke patients at NHNN on 4 occasions. Funding for a further 12 months has been obtained.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Workshop Facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1140</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Biomedical Vacation Scholarship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Wellcome Trust Ltd</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>06006E65-C8B1-48E3-90F7-3D2E8D4CAEF4</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0900637</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>A77DAE3A-499B-4F46-971D-6C82F51F9C2E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stroke</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>AAFE74BF-2594-40A4-9487-23A469C7A3C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.6  Psychological and behavioural</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
