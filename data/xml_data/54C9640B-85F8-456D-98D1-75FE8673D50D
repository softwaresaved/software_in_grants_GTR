Yet major concerns remain about access, reach, and regulation of microfinance institutions (MFIs), and their poverty reduction impacts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research focuses on strengthening consumer protection in MF to support growth and innovation in key urban sectors - street vending, artisanal mining, tourism services, construction, and food processing - through comparative studies in Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and India.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hypothesis is that poor regulation of MFIs and lack of safety nets limit accessibility and take-up of MF services, creating excessive debt for poor borrowers, which inhibits micro-enterprise innovation and growth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The objectives are to analyse comparatively:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; national and local policies on MF consumer protection&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; barriers, benefits and risks to micro-enterprises of accessing MF&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; consumer protection in different MF packages, eg collateral requirements, interest rates, customer support&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the impact of micro-finance on urban economic growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Methods include desk studies and key informant interview with government, advisory and regulatory agencies, formal, semi-formal and informal MFIs, and semi-structured interviews with micro-enterprises in the identified economic growth sectors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research has direct relevance to policy experts and financial-service managers at international, national and municipal level in providing a conceptual framework for improved understanding of: the financial-service requirements of micro-entrepreneurs in five sectors; the barriers and opportunities for access inherent in a range of microfinance services; the risks undertaken by the poor in accessing them, and the gaps in, and benefits of the regulatory context within which these services operate.
The research is also central to the concerns of grassroots organisations of the working poor in providing a powerful 'evaluation toolkit' to support advocacy for strengthening customer rights and evaluating proposed interventions in the system.
The core aim of the Pathways to Impact (Appendix 5) is to channel the findings into pro-poor policy, facilitate the take-up of the conceptual framework and the proposed 'evaluation toolkit' by international, national, municipal and civil society organisations, and make 'local recommendations' in each of the cities studied. 
Key targets groups include:
- In-country organisations including central /local government and professional groups
- International agencies and the donor community
- Organisations of street traders and the working poor.
The Impact Plan includes:
a) Local Dissemination:
In each country a workshop with representatives from micro-entrepreneur associations, microfinance institutions and services, regulators and representatives of other stakeholder groups .
b) International Dissemination:
Two international seminars will be held for donors, government representatives and CSOs, one facilitated by UN-Habitat in Nairobi, and a second facilitated by the ILO in Geneva. A seminar in India at Ahmedabad will facilitated by CEPT University, a leading Indian urban planning school.
c) Dissemination to Organisations of the Working Poor:
The toolkit will be widely disseminated through the WIEGO network. WIEGO and its affiliates of member-based organisations of the working poor together represent about two million workers; and through WILDAF, an international umbrella association of women concerned with legal reform in development.
d) Involvement in Other Programmes:
The research team is well-placed to bring the work to the attention of a wider practice-based audience, for example at the World Urban Forum 2014, and through professional networks, and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum.
To ensure legacy, a core part of the research strategy has been the involvement of Advisors to comment on the detailed research design, help refine the research outcomes, and disseminate findings. The research will be informed by, and feed into WIEGO's five-year project on 'Inclusive Cities for the Working Poor,' which will allow medium term monitoring of the impacts. 
The research will also be disseminated through ANLEP, the Academic Network for Legal Empowerment of the Poor, an on-going project to examine mechanisms for pro-poor legal reform, with which the PI has now worked for five years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>282517</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Chair, Special Session on the Informal Sector, Launch of the report 'Enhancing Economic Productivity in the Urban Informal Economy', Habitat III</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>344CEB8B-216E-4074-82D9-4AE7D336416D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Special Session on the Informal Sector, Casa de la Cultura, Quito, Tues 18 Oct, 2016, Habitat III, UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development,17-21 October 2016.

The event was held at ODI offices in London and live-streamed to a global audience.

The event explored the findings on access to finance by micro-enterprises, and the potential for improved financial access to contribute to jobs and economic growth. The research recognises that microfinance is not a guaranteed route out of poverty, but sees access to secure financial services as an important right.

The research is of relevance to: 
- global and national microfinance research organisations; 
- central government regulators of micro-finance institutions (MFIs), ie: Central Banks and Ministries of Finance; 
- ministries of social protection and consumer welfare;
- commercial and charitable MFIs and MFI associations
- NGOs working to support poverty reduction
- consumer-protection organisations, and 
- associations of micro-entrepreneurs 

1. CASE STUDIES
THE research team completed case studies in Rwanda (Muhanga, Musanze, Kigali); Tanzania (Arusha, Dar es Salaam); Kenya (Kisumu, Nairobi), and Ethiopia (Hawassa, Addis Ababa), and India (Rajkot and Ahmedabad, Gujarat).

In each country work included: 
- regulatory and document review and for background paper;
- key informant interviews with regulators (Central Bank and others), micro-finance banks, micro-finance institutions (credit-giving), NGO providers etc;
- extended semi-structured questionnaires with micro-enterprises to examine patterns of borrowing from informal or formal lenders: 1043 interviews have been completed (Rwanda: 221) (Tanzania: 206) (Kenya: 201) (Ethiopia: 208) (India: 207).

2. DATA ANALYSIS AND FEEDBACK
Data analysis reports have been completed for each of the 5 case studies. 
Feedback visits were held in the four East African countries (Dar es Salaam, Feb 15; Nairobi, Apr 15; Addis Ababa, May 15; Kigali, Sep 15). Findings from India are being used to inform the East African case studies.
Feedback visits included a workshop with key stakeholders in micro-finance regulation and operation from four main groups: Central Bank and Ministry staff involved in SME promotion; micro-finance associations and operators; NGOs involved in savings programmes; and small business operators. 

3. TANZANIA WORKSHOP
In February 2015, the research team contributed to the high-level workshop in Tanzania run by REPOA, in partnership with ODI, entitled Shaping Economic Transformation in Tanzania. This brought together findings from three DEGRP projects and was attended by several Ministers and MPs. The team's presentation looked at the role of micro-finance in economic transformations for small and micro-enterprises. 

4. LONDON WORKSHOP
The team held a final workshop on 25 June 2015 to discuss project findings. The workshop was held in London at ODI. ODI also facilitated a public event on the project, Microfinance and Innovation in Africa's Cities, which was recorded and live-streamed. The event, chaired by Prof A Brown, included 6 speakers from the project: Dr. Wolday Amha, Association of Ethiopian Microfinance Institutions, Mrs. Winnie Terry, Tanzania Association of Microfinance Institutions, Mr. Peter Gikang'a, Central Bank of Kenya, and Katherine Hughes, Financial Inclusion Programme Officer, CARE International, with responses from Prof T GebgreEgziabher, Univ. Addis Ababa and Prof D Mahadevia, CEPT University. 

5. OVERALL FINDINGS
Two countries, Kenya and Tanzania, promoted a market-led approach. Kenyan law divides microfinance institutions (MFIs) into deposit-taking, credit-only, and informal savings/loan associations (SLAs). Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) also exist. Consumer protection is embedded in the constitution and legislation. Job creation is a priority with government-supported MF provided through county funds for youth, women etc. Innovations in mobile money are transforming financial access-one mobile savings/credit company had 9.2m accounts by 2014. 

Tanzania also has a wide range of MF provision including: banks, MF companies, financial cooperatives, SACCOs, credit-only MFIs, financial NGOs, and unregulated self-help groups. The 2013 National Financial Inclusion Framework is being implemented, but a 2013 report estimated that 14% of urban residents were still financially excluded. Mobile credit is now taking off. In both Kenya and Tanzania, NGOs are piloting VSLA (village SLA) methods in urban areas. 
In contrast, Ethiopia and Rwanda have strong state-led approaches to MF development. In Ethiopia, micro-enterprise development through government-sponsored training and solidarity loans, is central to poverty-reduction and business strategies. All MFIs are deposit-taking, but poor phone infrastructure hinders expansion of mobile money. In Rwanda, SME development is also core to government strategy, with a focus on youth and cooperative formation. After an MF policy was launched in 2008, and legislation in 2009, 416 Umurenge SACCOs were created, one in each district, representing about half of the country's MF assets. Mobile money is growing rapidly.

Four key findings arise from our surveys of 821 micro-enterprises across four growth sectors: trade, tourism, construction and manufacturing.
A) Access: to MF varies in nature and scale due to the roles of government and private sector, types of institutions, innovations (e.g mobile money), the overall economy, and lack of MF products that accommodate fluctuating incomes. 
B) Use: the studies reaffirm the widely-proven varied use of MF in the lives of the poorest, for businesses, school fees or family emergencies. Savings and borrowing in Ethiopia were notably high.
C) Consumer protection: varies across products/institutions and countries, and there are important lessons to be shared, particularly in relation mobile money.
D) Growth: studies found limited signs of micro-enterprise growth, as productivity was hampered by social issues (e.g. fear of borrowing), institutional barriers (e.g. harassment by authorities), and financial barriers (e.g. lack of MFI capital; lack of financial literacy).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E93B8629-743C-490E-9688-6F0F7455C770</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research aimed to analyse barriers, benefits and risks to urban micro-enterprises in accessing financial services and the potential for improved microfinance (MF) regulation and consumer protection. The focus was on secondary towns and larger cities in expanding economies: Ethiopia; Kenya; Rwanda, and Tanzania. India's more mature microfinance sector provided a comparison. The research recognises that access to secure financial services, including savings, transfers and credit, is not a silver bullet, but an important part of wider poverty-reduction initiatives.

Key recommendations include the need for: better integration between SLAs and formal finance; wider dissemination of good practice on urban SLAs; written loan agreements; more transparency on mobile micro-credit; loan products that accommodate fluctuating incomes, and better management information systems for SACCOs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research is useful to international agencies, national governments, microfinance institutions and associations of micro-entrepreneurs. 

Key partners have included i) national banks (National Bank of Rwanda, Central Bank of Kenya, and Bank of Tanzania), ii) microfinance associations, including AEMFI (Association of Ethiopian Microfinance Institutions), TAMFI (Tanzanian Association of Microfinance Institutions) and AMIR (Association of Microfinance Institutions in Rwanda), iii) NGOs including CARE International, World Visions and local NGOs, and iv) micro-enterprise associations.

The research has been taken forward through in-country seminars in all four East African countries, bringing together MFI providers, regulators and micro-enterprise associations. Each partner is currently taking forward the results relevant to their organisation. Presentations have also been made to the World Forum on Local Economic Development, and the findings will be included in a joint publication between UN-Habitat, WIEGO and Cardiff University.

A key research partnership has been with the Bank of Tanzania, which is using the findings nationally in implementing national financial consumer protection systems, regionally through training with the East Africa Community, and internationally through the Alliance of Financial Inclusion's work on Digital Delivered Credit. Work is on-going with World Vision to explore the development of urban savings
