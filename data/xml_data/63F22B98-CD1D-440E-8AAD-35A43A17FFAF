Much was promised and many changes have been introduced - but how much has been achieved, especially for the most vulnerable and previously disadvantaged groups? What factors have enabled or constrained change across the public health system, nationally recognised as the leading edge of efforts to improve the health and well-being of vulnerable groups? What lessons does past experience hold for continuing efforts to improve health care and health? What issues need to be tracked over time to generate the evidence needed to support future policy and managerial decision-making?

This proposed grant intends to address these questions. It is jointly submitted by a team of public health system policy-makers/managers and researchers based in the Western Cape (WC) province. As South Africa is a quasi-federal state, the WC provincial government has the constitutional responsibility for ensuring an effective health system for its population. It also has a reputation for having been relatively effective in sustaining implementation of such change over the last 20 years. Examining the particular experience of one province, in comparison with wider national experience, will allow in-depth investigation of South African health system transformation. The project will consider not only what changes have been implemented, with what achievements and challenges, but also what set of political, leadership, organisational and other factors have supported or limited the implementation of change. From this analysis it will seek to identify the pathways to change underpinning health system development in the province. The project team's combination of experience and expertise will support this in-depth investigation.

Better understanding of what the province has achieved and how, set against the national context, will offer insights of relevance across the country, as well as internationally. It will also, more specifically, contribute to generating the evidence base needed to support future policy and management decision-making, by supporting provincial health system monitoring and evaluation activities and identifying related, larger scale research needs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Over the last twenty years South Africa has implemented a broad array of changes within its health system in order to improve its ability to offer good quality health care at reasonable cost to vulnerable population groups. Whilst there is national recognition that performance improvements have fallen short of expectations, the Western Cape province is reputed to have performed relatively well. The proposed exploratory and formative research will examine this province's experience since 1994, comparing it with wider national experience and considering the lessons for future monitoring and evaluation of health system development, including related research needs. The project's objectives will be addressed through a sequenced set of data collection activities, comprising review of existing policy documents and research reports, elite interviews with policy-makers, and analysis of routinely collected health system data for the Western Cape and other provinces. The Western Cape experience will be set against wider national experience, including specific comparison with two other provinces which will be purposefully selected to allow reflection on insights generated by initial analysis of the Western Cape experience. The project will be guided and supported by a steering committee comprised of policy-makers, managers and researchers, who will together tease out wider lessons - including those concerning future provincial monitoring and evaluation activities. The project, therefore, is itself an example of the embedded research identified as important for health policy and systems research.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will have positive social impact by contributing to health system performance improvements that preferentially benefit previously dis-advantaged and vulnerable population groups in South Africa. By better understanding the whole system change necessary to enable such performance improvements the project will offer lessons and guidance for policy-makers and managers across South Africa, and in other countries. By supporting the development of WC provincial monitoring and evaluation activities focussed on future health system change efforts, the project will also support the generation of evidence to inform managerial decision-making and sustain whole system change over time. Improved decision-making will, in turn, assist the South African provincial and national health departments to establish a person-centred health system - and perhaps more quickly and efficiently than without such evidence. The WC monitoring and evaluation experience will also generate lessons of relevance to other provinces. 

Additional South African beneficiaries of the research - who will mediate its impact on the ultimate beneficiaries - are the health system managers seeking to sustain health system transformation in the Western Cape and other provinces. The involvement of senior Western Cape provincial health department officials in the project team is a clear indication of demand for this research and of their intention to use the study's findings. The planned use of the study's finding to support future provincial monitoring and evaluation activities is in response to an explicit request to academic partners from the provincial health department, and will support the sustained influence of the findings in future decision-making. Nationally, there is also a demand for evidence on how to strengthen the health system, as shown by the priorities identified in the 2011 National Health Research Summit (Mayosi et al. 2011) and the national department of health's support for eleven pilot sites in which to test and learn from new health system strengthening approaches. The 2011 National Evaluation Policy Framework, moreover, demonstrates a strong government-wide interest in policy evaluation work (The Presidency, 2011).

The benefits of the research will, finally, extend outside South Africa. The study will generate insights about what whole system change entails and how to support it. These insights will not be transferable to other settings as instrumental 'policy lessons', but can act to stimulate managers in other settings to consider, for example, the broad array of health system changes needed to support sustained performance improvements benefiting vulnerable populations and the political and organisational strategies that might sustain such changes. Adapting insights from South Africa to their own contexts is a critical managerial act of lesson-drawing (Rose 1993). The international relevance of such insights lies, moreover, in the recognition that health systems are able to influence the distribution of health across population groups (CSDH 2008), but weak health systems hinder the deliver of health services and waste resources (Fernandes et al. 2014; WHO 2007).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100673</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Catalonia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Health</gtr:department><gtr:description>WholeSyst-SA Working Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>3775E75A-1AA4-431E-8666-76A73656517F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This group is also linked to the journal club and researcher - policy think tank mentioned in previous section.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Shared endeavour as a collaboration for co-production of knowledge</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Shared endeavour as a collaboration for co-production of knowledge</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of the Western Cape</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Western Cape HPSR hub</gtr:description><gtr:id>1343849C-CF1D-45C2-B406-3337EB80D406</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a consequence of these partnerships, existing activities have continued (such as journal club) and this has allowed for deeper relationships to be formed, and new initiatives to be developed (such as the researcher-policy think tank) 

1. Journal Club: Bi-monthly journal club to discuss HPSR papers and share relevant experience between researchers and policy-makers, intended to develop common understandings and better knowledge of each others' perspectives. The journal club has had influence over policy thinking and provincial policy documents, and has helped to inform research priorities.

2. Researcher-Policy think tank: a new outcome recently established aimed at deepening understandings in priority areas such as governance.

The session was held at the international symposium on health systems research. The discussions gave policy makers a platform to share their experiences from different contexts, and sparked a lovely debate afterwards. 

The contributing panel were all policy-makers who have led - and still lead- action in their health systems to respond to challenges and nurture resilience. 

The substantive content of the session focused on the experiences of: 1) The Lebanon, which, in a continuing context of political instability, saw its population increase by 30% 2011-2013 due to the influx of Syrian refugees, and yet has managed to sustain health system performance - maintaining and even improving health outcomes in that time; 2) Kerala State, India, which, building on a long history of strong health system performance, has more recently taken innovative action to address the new challenge of non- communicable diseases and expand the space of decision-making in the health system; and 3) the Western Cape province, South Africa, which has sustained a more than 20 year process of health system transformation to redress the legacy of apartheid and meet the new challenges of a quadruple burden of disease, a population growing due to internal migration and a stagnating economy. 

The session included presentations outlining the critical elements of context and experience in each setting. Our target audience included managers and policy makers from other health systems, as well as researchers, students and funding agencies interested in learning from policy-makers and managers. 

The significance of this session for the symposium was its focus on real-world experiences of nurturing health system resilience, the presentation of a range of experiences, and the provision of an opportunity to hear from, and engage with, policy makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Timeline mapping workshops</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF9F7158-63CC-436F-B124-3E12022ACC34</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two timeline mapping workshops (one with urban based health managers, and one with rural based health managers) were held in order to gather views across the health department of key changes and events that occurred over the last 22 years.
