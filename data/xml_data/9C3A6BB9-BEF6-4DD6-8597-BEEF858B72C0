This will be the first interdisciplinary network of UK scholars investigating the intersections of media and digital advertising. This network will also aid the advancement of broader networking amongst academics studying media and advertising, and between academics, industry practitioners and policy networks. 

Across digital media new forms of integrated advertising are developing rapidly. 
Branded content is occurring in different forms across news media, entertainment and social media. Emergent forms include paid content in news and 'native advertising' which is an online variant of advertorials, where advertisements follow the form and user experience associated with the context in which they are placed. In entertainment media, marketing integration includes advertiser-financed television, product placement, virtual advertising and advergames. 

Boundaries between media and advertising are being tested, crossed and erased. The emergence of new forms of integrated advertising raise a host of issues ranging from consumer awareness and acceptance, to editorial independence and creative autonomy. 

Branded content is both an economic and cultural phenomena that requires cross-disciplinary resources and new approaches in analysis. Assessing the impact and policy implications of these practices requires a better understanding of the cultural forms, working arrangements and practices that are developing amongst producers and users and the attitudes of various practitioners, publics and stakeholders. Fast-evolving practices of media-marketing integration require research to inform debate on the values and objectives for public policy and the suitability of different forms of governance. Studying these phenomena requires political economic, legal and policy analysis as well as historical, cultural and social enquiry. The network activities therefore engage concerns at the intersection of the ESRC and AHRC. 

Much industry discussion focuses on the most effective ways to develop branded content amidst efforts to secure the support of politicians, regulators and key publics. However, these practices face opposition and have provoked controversies such as those surrounding the development of Facebook's Sponsored Stories, Twitter's Promoted Tweets, Yahoo's 'Stream Ads'. The relaxation of rules to permit product placement in television has generated on-going controversy and debate. UK media governance has historically benefitted from clear demarcation between marketers' sponsored content and the media's own editorial content. The evolving forms of branded content online have intensified challenges to the separation of editorial and advertising that were already being felt across print and television. Most of the discussion of branded content to date has occurred within the work of industry practitioners and specialist media, with limited discussion in general media. However issues surrounding branded content engage the concerns of a much wider range of civil society organizations that include trade unions, consumer groups and cultural organisations. This network will help to promote knowledge exchange across a very wide range of interests and perspectives. 

The project will comprise seminars bringing together academics, industry practitioners and other stakeholders, parliamentary and public meetings. A dedicated website will be created to support research and network activities, and there will be themed series of articles published in the online journal openDemocracy as well as reports, briefings and academic publications to build knowledge, share perspectives and promote collaboration amongst key stakeholder groups interested in the implications for practitioners, researchers and policy-makers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research project is designed to improve links between academics and key stakeholders for the benefit of both. The key beneficiaries are
Policy-makers and policy actors engaged with media and marketing. 
- Media and marketing industry practitioners and associations. 
- Media trades unions.
- Civil society organisations involved with media or consumer affairs.
- General media and media/marketing trade media. 
- Interested members of the public as users/consumers/citizens.
 
Branded content is a rapidly growing phenomena understood by marketing professionals but not widely understood by most others, including journalists and others working in media industries. It challenges and has profound implications for communications regulation, working practices, user expectations and media literacy. Decisions about governance need to be informed by academic research on professional practices, legal-regulatory measures, public understanding and attitudes, and by wide-ranging debate amongst all stakeholders. The network will address these needs and facilitate research on professional practice and working arrangements, governance and policy issues. The ensuing research will inform outputs that include reports, briefings and information for key stakeholder groups and publics. The network will also engage with and benefit policy-makers and policy networks. Network members will make submissions to the UK and national governments, regulators and supranational agencies on the governance of branded content. Academic research will be aided by greater access to and dialogue with industry, policy-makers and civil society organisations. In turn these interested parties will benefit from academic research and collaborative efforts to inform and engage key publics. Partners and participants have been carefully selected to ensure links with key networks beyond academia notably those involving academic-industry collaboration, media policy networks, and civil society organisations concerned with the communication industries. 
Research from the network will inform policy submissions made by individual academics and partner organisations. The network itself will not make policy recommendations but remain an open network that seeks to facilitate research, discussion and collaboration. Several of the academics involved in the network play lead roles in media policy networks including the Media Reform Coalition, the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom and the Media, Communication and Cultural Studies Association (Meccsa) policy group. The network will build on the experience of policy networking of members to communicate with as wide a range of interested stakeholder groups and associations as possible. As well as the advisory group members such as the Branded Content Marketing Association, other industry associations will be invited to contribute to seminars and this will facilitate exchange on policy issues as well as practice. The key regulators Ofcom, Advertising Standards Authority and Atvod will also be invited to participate, with Alison Preston, Ofcom's Head of Media Literacy a confirmed speaker. There will be a briefing meeting for MPs followed by a public meeting in Parliament organised with the assistance of John McDonnell MP who will book rooms in Parliament at no cost to the network and also disseminate invitations and policy material electronically to all MPs. 

Academic participants are involved in a diverse range of research projects that will lead to publications drawing on network activities. Collaborations will include contributions to The Advertising Handbook and to a themed series of articles for Open Democracy. 
A dedicated website will be created within the first two months that will be organised to serve key publics including media enquiries. The site will be open access and aimed to appeal to the general public as well as academics and stakeholder groups, with accessible briefings produced by the PI and members.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24604</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Branded Content Research Network Seminar 1: Investigating Branded Content (3 November 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DC060661-D405-4210-9B5E-BAF2FBBF0BBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>35 people attended the launch seminar for the branded content research network.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.brandedcontentresearchnetwork.org/network/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Branded Content Research Network Seminar 2: Industry-Academic Research Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B7114FB-F7DE-4BCB-812E-CC38BBD1B0DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was the second of a series of four seminars for the branded content research network. The event addressed academic-industry research collaboration and involved contributions from academic researchers, branded content industry practitioners and key industry trade bodies including Andrew Canter Global CEO of the Branded Content Marketing Association. Speakers included Associate Professor Catherine Johnson, author of Branding Television (Routledge, 2012) and co-author with Prof. Paul Grainge of Promotional Screen Industries (Routledge, 2015) and Prof Iain MacRury, Deputy Dean Research and Professional Practice, Bournemouth University (BU) and co-investigator Branded Content Research Network. Performance poet Jeremiah 'SugarJ' Brown, who worked with Nationwide Building Society, discussed his participation as an artist in branded content. 
Prof Jonathan Hardy (Principal Investigator, Branded Content Research Network) discussed future network activities and our collective project to map the new media-marketing ecologies. After lunch, Melanie Gray (BU) and BU undergraduate Zoe Gardener discussed branded content work for Rolls Royce and some cultural-brand cross-overs.After workshops, there was a final industry panel that included Adam Lewis, Head of Social and Content Marketing at Bright Blue Day; Andrew Canter Global CEO at BCMA (Branded Content Marketing Association) and David Alterman, Director at the Nursery (Research and planning agency). These high-profile experts explored the place of data, creativity and regulation in the branded context environment.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/branded-content-research-network-seminar-2-industry-academic-research-collaboration-tickets-29273433628</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This is an interim report for an ongoing project that began in September 2016. What can be demonstrated at this stage is that the project is on track to deliver planned research impact. 
This includes arrangements to publish themed articles on the societal implications of branded content in the online publication openDemocracy from April 2017. A range of contributors will discuss the issues and implications of branded content practices and debate regulatory responses and public policy proposals. Alongside other published work this is intended to bring research from the network to a wider public audience and to promote policy debate.

Another key indicator of impact is the discussion and engagement with partners and stakeholders in preparation for our April seminar and public meeting on the regulation of branded content. The seminar will be attended by representatives of regulatory agencies including the Advertising Standards Authority and IMPRESS, the National Union of Journalists and other media unions. Speakers include academic members of the network and Cliff Fluet, Partner, Lewis Silkin and Legal Counsel for the Branded Content Marketing Association. The PI has held meetings with these and other key stakeholders and provided research briefing that draw on expertise across the network. The briefings have identified and compared the responses of regulatory agencies in the UK, US and European Union and set out key issues for debates arising from UK regulations. These research contributions have been welcomed as valuable and will be developed into briefings for Members of Parliament, key stakeholders and public audiences over the coming weeks. The seminar on policy and regulation of branded content is co-hosted by Meccsa Policy Group, part of the Media, Communication and Cultural Studies Association and the Westminster Institute for Advanced Studies. The seminar will be followed by a briefing for MPs and a public meeting in Parliament. Through these activities network research into existing regulation and discussion of policy issues will influence key policy stakeholders, reach the membership of participating organisations such as the NUJ and communicate with wider public audiences.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>263C7978-047F-48A3-A437-2DBFF3E13D3F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This is an interim report. The Branded Content Research Network is an academic network project whose central aim is to facilitate research and networking between academics, practitioners, policy actors, civil society groups and other stakeholders to explore branded content practices and their media policy implications. The main activity is the organisation of four network seminars, a conference, publications and related activities. The project began in September 2016 and we have completed two seminars and all activities to date in accordance with the planned timetable. 

1. Mapping the media-marketing ecology
From our initial seminar in November 2016 we identified a collective research project to identify the key actors and processes that make up contemporary relations between marketers, marketing agencies and media content providers. These core elements remain, but are surrounded by an increasing range of intermediary actors and processes though which branded content is negotiated, produced and placed. This project invites network researchers working in specialist areas to contribute so that we build up a mapping across music, fashion, retail and other domains of media-marketing integration. Amongst the key findings are that the implications of automation in processes from programmatic native advertising to content recommendation engines requires revision of existing ways of thinking about media -marketing relationships with implications for research, education and policy-making. 

2. Regulating branded content and editorial/advertising integration
Regulatory authorities in the UK, US, EU and elsewhere have grappled with the regulation of branded content and native advertising. Principles that marketing communications should be recognisable as such have been challenged by advertising forms 'native' to the media context in which they are placed. Our project is building a comparative analysis of regulatory responses to inform policy-makers and policy stakeholders. Key interim findings are that there is considerable variation in the purposes and rationales amongst the agencies that regulate branded content. In part, this reflects historical differences in the regulation of different media, notable press and broadcasting, and the arrangements to separate regulation of advertising from editorial content. Those arrangements are tested and challenged by brands' involvement in media content. The issues of labelling and identification, consumer awareness, determining marketers' editorial control, and regulatory convergence, will be examined at forthcoming seminars with representatives from regulatory agencies, lawyers and academics.

3. Media-marketing convergence and higher education. 
This next wave of convergence of media and marketing communications challenges media studies as marketing communications and public relations have tended to be specialist sub-fields with limited overlap. Media studies has begun to address this broader convergence but the institutional and conceptual architecture lags behind developments. Research by the Principal Investigator informed a submission to the QAA Subject Benchmark Statement for Communication, Media, Film and Cultural Studies and talks given at the BFI Media Studies Conference (June 2016), IAMCR (July 2016), European Communication Research and Education Association (November 2016), MECCSA(January 2017). 

4. International partnerships
The network has built strong partnerships with international researchers. These include the Advertising Research Group in ECREA with whom we will co-host two of our forthcoming events.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research outcomes will be taken forward by academic researchers in the UK and internationally, by policy stakeholders and by publics informed through online publications and other media. The PI is preparing a commissioned monograph that will publicise key findings. Subject to approval he will edit a book series aimed at academic and public audiences, including books written by network members. Discussions are underway to secure themed journal outputs derived from papers presented at network events.

Public-facing articles will be published in the online publication openDemocracy, a partner in the project, from April 2017. The opening contributions are by the PI and network member Mara Einstein of New York University, author of Black Ops Advertising, who will speak at the November 2017 conference. The research outputs of other network members will be compiled on the website (www.brandedcontentresearchnetwork). Articles, news reports and summaries of research will be submitted to participating organisations to be published in their online and print media. 

Policy submissions and briefings made by individual academics and partner organisations with be sent to policy-makers and stakeholders. The network itself will not make policy recommendations but remain an open network that seeks to facilitate research, discussion and collaboration.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B98A4B89-AEA8-4E08-993F-919154FBF189</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.brandedcontentresearchnetwork.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/800E3692-15AF-4C6F-8883-CCDAA8AF0171"><gtr:id>800E3692-15AF-4C6F-8883-CCDAA8AF0171</gtr:id><gtr:title>Explorations in Critical Studies of Advertising</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8cdc37128f45833332c0ee457dd6ee0e"><gtr:id>8cdc37128f45833332c0ee457dd6ee0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hardy J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-138-64952-1</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/50E1DC34-523A-4086-93D4-FCD9292BE71E"><gtr:id>50E1DC34-523A-4086-93D4-FCD9292BE71E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Branded Content: marketers, media and (in)equality of voice</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8cdc37128f45833332c0ee457dd6ee0e"><gtr:id>8cdc37128f45833332c0ee457dd6ee0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hardy J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E963B877-4863-4D9D-BC77-8826581AE182"><gtr:id>E963B877-4863-4D9D-BC77-8826581AE182</gtr:id><gtr:title>When everything is 'content marketing': examining media and marketing convergence in practices, policy and critique.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8cdc37128f45833332c0ee457dd6ee0e"><gtr:id>8cdc37128f45833332c0ee457dd6ee0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hardy J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N007719/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D2CB8837-62DB-4A15-93B7-61B4D1701A78</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Journalism</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2968C870-0FF4-4AE9-A670-9B0161C83B37</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>New Media/Web-Based Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C597DCEC-497B-45A1-8662-9C7AFF112DDE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Publishing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46E85C19-DECF-4873-978B-4B57CA5EAC7B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Television HTC</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
