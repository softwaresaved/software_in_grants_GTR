The network has facilitated collaborative research among contributors who are geographically dispersed in different departments and universities across the UK and France. It has also made opportunities for young researchers. Unlike most previous work on this topic, the network is defined by its interdisciplinary and trans-national approach. By focusing on the means by which ideas circulated, as much as content / that is to say, such agents of transfer as networks, journalism, commerce/ the network has opened up a new direction in cultural and intellectual history of eighteenth-century Britain and France.

The main activity of the network was to organise two workshops, which brought together a number of recognised experts from a range of disciplines, including History, History of Science, History of Political Thought, History of Philosophy, French studies, together with invited specialists. The first of these was on Journalism and the Book Trade (organised by Simon Burrows in Leeds). The second was on networks (organised by Ann Thomson and Sarah Hutton in Paris). The topics were selected both for their relevance to the main theme and for the scope they offer for inter- disciplinary inclusiveness. Each workshop was conceived as a pilot study of one aspect of the means of intellectual transfer. Both workshops were useful for the exchange of ideas, for consolidating the group of participants and comparing methodologies of the participating disciplines. They also laid ground for a future programme of collaborative research of an inter-disciplinary and trans-national nature.

A primary aim of the network was to form a cross-disciplinary team to undertake future long-term collaborative research on international intellectual interchange in the period. A vital aspect of this was achieved through expansion of the network, in line with recommendations in the referees' reports. First, we added to our pool of expertise from within British universities Secondly, at an early stage, steps were taken to achieve a partnership with French researchers in the field. We were successful in setting up a collaboration with the French programme de recherche, 'Transferts culturels France-Grande Bretagne, agents, vecteurs, r&amp;eacute;seaux, XVII-XIXe' directed by Ann Thomson (Paris 8). The collaboration was consolidated forming a combined steering group consisting of the original AHRC steering group with Prof. Thomson. We have also adopted the umbrella title for both groups, 'Cultural Transfers in the Long Eighteenth Century.' The workshops described were important for achieving good working relations both among the original British participants, and with our French partners.

These developments have been important for strengthening the expertise and international character of the network and essential for achieving the longer term aim of the workshops to promote collaborative research both between universities in the UK and between British researchers and their counterparts in French universities/Franco-British collaboration being, of course, essential for the viability of the research topic. An important ancillary outcome of the international collaboration has been a more cost-effective use of financial resources, which has enabled us to plan a third workshop (on Translation) after the term date of the AHRC grant. The combined group has made plans for future collaborative, interdisciplinary research focusing on European Networks. This will extend the life of the project, and enlarge the geographical coverage to other European countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8145</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/366CA495-749C-441A-9130-F5520838283C"><gtr:id>366CA495-749C-441A-9130-F5520838283C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cultural Transfers: France and Britain in the Long Eighteenth Century</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/80f72d8871c786e6e085636e4cabb383"><gtr:id>80f72d8871c786e6e085636e4cabb383</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thomson, Ann; Burrows, Simon; Dziembowski, Edmond</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780729409933</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E508545/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
