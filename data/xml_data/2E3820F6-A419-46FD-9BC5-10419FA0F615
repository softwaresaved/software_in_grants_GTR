series is designed to promote thought and new perspectives on the difficulties posed by people who have major problems in their lives and their relationships - who are sometimes given the diagnosis of 'personality disorder'. At their most extreme these difficulties involve high levels of criminal offending and violence. For over 200 hundred years efforts have been made to diagnose these individuals as though they suffer from a mental disorder with various labels being used such as 'moral insanity', 'psychopathy' and 'Antisocial Personality Disorder'.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The series is driven by the belief that there is considerable benefit to be gained by encouraging cross disciplinary perspectives.There is a danger that currently prevailing practices and policies are too focused on individual psychopathology. Whilst there is no doubt benefit in understanding the psychology of such individuals, for example, there is a danger of too little attention being paid to the social and cultural contexts that produce and sustain these problems. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This seminar series will bring together perspectives from a range of academic disciplines along with professionals representing different aspects of the health and welfare services, and with service users who had direct experience of living with these difficulties.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The social problems created by those whose behaviour falls under the category of 'Antisocial Personality Disorder' are considerable. Despite the recognition of these kinds of difficulties going back 200 hundred years, we are still struggling to find solutions. We are aiming this seminar series to have an impact on academic research and practice. We will do this by bringing together perspectives from a wide range of professional groups who work in this field, these groups will include (as evidenced by our list of participants): 

 - Psychiatrists
 - Clinical Psychologists
 - Social Workers
 - Psychotherapists
 - Probation Officers
 - Prison officers

We will reach people by using professional networks and bring these together with academic networks: 

 - International Association of Forensic Psychotherapists (Chris Scanlon is on the board)
 - Centre for History of Emotion (see letter of support)
 - Association for Therapeutic Communities
 - Media and the Inner World (see letter of support)
 - Association for Psychosocial Studies (UK- Psychosocial Network) (David Jones is on the Steering Committee)
- Emergence (a service user group for people who have had personality disorder diagnosis) 

We will also use these and professional networks to publicise calls for papers for all these events. This is important in that we want to bring together people who might be working in diverse areas. In addition:

 - A series website will be established 
 - A JISC mail network will be organised and all interested people encouraged to subscribe.

We aim to improve knowledge and practice in this area. The ideas emerging from this series will directly feed into a number of initiatives that are already running or are planned:

 - PGCert: 'Psychosocial Perspectives on Working with People with Personality Disorders'. This is a programme that is run collaboratively by Millfields/East London Hospital Trust and the School of Law and Social Science at the University of East London. This programme has been designed with input from service users. It has its first intake during 2013. All students will be encouraged to attend all sessions.

 - The seminar series will be made available to all probation officers on the 'Pathways project' (see DoH 2011) funded by the Ministry of Justice that involves Millfields (where Chris Scanlon is employed as Consultant Psychotherapist), Forensic Intensive Psychological Treatment Service (FIPTS), Forensic mental Heath Services, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and the Bracton Centre, Oxleas Mental Health Trust.

 - A cross disciplinary Professional Doctorate in 'Psychosocial Clinical Practice' is planned to run in the School of Law and Social Science, University of East London. All students will be encouraged to attend events.

 - Students on a range of Professional Doctorate programmes run in collaborative partnership between the University of East London and the Tavistock Foundation Clinic will be encouraged to participate. David Jones sits on the Tavistock-UEL Strategic Partnership Board.

The events will feed directly into a number of publication initiatives:

 - David Jones (PI) has already been commissioned already to write a book by Routledge with the title: Disordered Personalities and Crime: A Psychosocial History of 'Moral Insanity'. This is due to appear in 2014.

 - Co-investigator Chris Scanlon will work with Anna Motz to edit a book on 'Gender and Forensic Mental Health', which is an important theme of the third year. 

 - Chris Scanlon and David Jones will edit a cross disciplinary collection towards the end of the series that will directly draw from work that emerges during the series. 

 - We are already discussing special editions of the journals of 'Psychoanalysis, Culture and Society', 'Critical Social Policy', and the 'International Journal of Therapeutic Communities'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27549</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Emergence Plus CIC</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Service user perspectives</gtr:description><gtr:id>38F2EB97-4ED7-461C-A61B-C0CD143181CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration with Emergence has already informed the conclusions of the book recently published by the David W Jones 'Disordered Personalities and Crine: An analysis of the history of moral insanity'.

We arranged for Professor Nicole Rafter (based in the United States) to come and give a paper. She has written some of the best known work on the history of the moral insanity diagnosis. 

She gave a paper that addressed the question about 'why' the various diagnoses had survived for as long as they had done so - given that the various diagnoses had always faced trenchant criticism. She argued that some of the key pressures came from 'social control professionals' who needed to justify their status and role by the claim to posses useful knowledge about dangerous individuals. In addition, she suggested, that 'we' as the general public also find these diagnoses comforting as explanations for dangerous and threatening behaviour.

David W Jones (PI) gave a paper that traced some themes in the history of the diagnosis of 'moral insanity' from its appearance towards the end of the 18th century through the 19th and into the 20th century. He argued that the categories have always been contentious as they are the product of 2 forces that are sometimes in conflict: the needs of criminal justice systems, and of the systems of welfare in relation to mental illness. He argued that ideas have always been crucially shaped in 'the public sphere' and were thus subject to 'our' fears, anxieties and hopes - the particular problem being that anxiety was very present, not only about violence but also anxiety about sex and sexuality seemed to emerge quite frequently.

There were a series of papers that were telling the story of the history of these categories from different parts of the world. Emilia Musumeci traced the history of 'moral insanity' in Italy in 19th century, that was to produce the influential work of Cesare Lombroso. Felix Schermann discussed how biological theories came to dominate thinking on this issue in 19th century Germany.

Bollette Frydendahl Larsen described her research into how the category of psychopath was imported to Denmark as an explanation for young women whose behaviour came to be viewed as 'incorrigible' in the early 20th century.

Katariina Parhi talked about her research, the first of its kind, on the development of the use of the category of 'psychopath' in Finland.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Immigrant Counselling and Psychotherapy (ICAP)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Antisocial organisations -Antisocial personalities</gtr:description><gtr:id>A8463A9A-BA21-45E9-944D-28B2DC6CA9C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We will continue to have conversations about further collaborations - in particular we have in mind further collaboration over planning a seminar on the issue of personality disorder and psychosocial dynamic homelessness, long-term unemployment and general complex social/emotional needs.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>ICAP are voluntary sector service based in London that provide counselling and psychotherapy services mainly for people with Irish backgrounds who live in London. They were able to help us bring together people who have had experience of 'institutional abuse' in Ireland. There have been highly significant revelations over the past couple of decades about the degree and scale of abuse that had occurred in institutions (often run by the Church in Ireland). Some of this work has great potential for helping us understand the dynamic between individual abusers (and the character/personalities and circumstances of those individuals), the impact on individuals and the institutions that all such 'allows' such abuse.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We worked alongside ICAP to organise this seminar.

This was held in February 2016. We used the experiences of institutionalised abuse in Ireland as a case study. We held an extremely well received seminar that involved practitioners, academics and those who had experienced abuse themselves. The practitioners attending found it extremely valuable in helping them understand aspects of the work that they do with individuals traumatised by such experiences. Some of the difficulties of the work need to be understood in terms of the complex dynamics that we are helping to understand.


Similarly, the seminar held in October 2016 - 'Gender, Violence and Antisocial Personalities'. This also brought together practitioners with academics - to explore the difficult dynamics that surround the forms of violence that are often associated with domestic abuse.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FC778C8D-6FFB-4C22-9754-7E4780643ED9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have now held a number of very successful seminars.

The importance of the perspective of those who experience these diagnoses was reinforced. These seminars fed very directly into a monograph written by the Principal Investigator called 'Disordered Personalities and Crime: A Historical Analysis of Moral Insanity', published by Routledge in 2016. The significant work on the history of these diagnoses also led directly to an application to the British Academy/Leverhulme Small Grant scheme for archival work on how mental health categories have been used to understand the problems of 'disturbed' children. This application was successful.

The 4th seminar involved collaboration with the organisation 'Media and the Inner World' and was held at the University of Bournemouth ( Faculty of Media and Communication). Participants came from academic and clinical backgrounds. We looked at how important media representations have been to the formation of clinical/psychiatric models of 'antisocial' personality disorders and how those clinical models have also been used in film and literature.. 

The 5th seminar involved particular collaboration with a practice organisation called ICAP (Immigrant Counselling and Psychotherapy Service) that is based in London but works with Irish people and those of Irish descent - many of whom who have been affected by the institutional abuse scandal in Ireland. We had speakers with expertise and knowledge of the institutional abuse scandals that have been uncovered in Ireland. The abuse of children and adults took place in Ireland over many years and were wide spread. This emphasized how important it was to understand how institutional contexts might encourage or allow seriously damaging and antisocial behaviour to occur. 

The 6th seminar in the series looked at the issue of 'Disordered Personalities and extremism'. We are very interested in how notions of pathological personalities might be used to understand extremist and destructive states of mind, This involved participants who were working with individuals who have been identified as 'extremist' - psychologists who work in assessment and detection within the justice and health services, psychologists and psychotherapists who work therapeutically with those so identified. We also had more academic perspectives on the political contexts that might be producing extremist states of minds and those shaping the particular policy responses. 

The 7th seminar looked at the issue of gender, violence and antisocial personalities. Again, we very successful in bringing together academics and practitioners together. This event was well attended by professionals who work with victims of, and perpetrators of domestic violence. 

AS we approach the final stages of the award we are developing a focus on understanding some of the contemporary states of mind that seem to be associated with destructive behaviour of different kinds. The next seminar is looking at the 'Borderline states of mind and destructive feelings: a diagnosis for our times', and the following on 'Narcissism and destructive leadership'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are succeeding in our aims to provoke discussion and build the capacity for further work in this area.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>431E181A-1AEE-47E0-BA16-9528B9CFDB20</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://aspd-incontext.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B24E4E34-71E4-4BEB-A7CF-007C56E3BFBB"><gtr:id>B24E4E34-71E4-4BEB-A7CF-007C56E3BFBB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disordered Personalities and Crime: An Analysis of the History of Moral Insanity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/44c43e1342f605f6c2aae82a768973be"><gtr:id>44c43e1342f605f6c2aae82a768973be</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones David W.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780415502061</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/62B54038-6582-41B2-93D9-D69031332B03"><gtr:id>62B54038-6582-41B2-93D9-D69031332B03</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disordered Personalities and Crime: An Analysis of the History of Moral Insanity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/44c43e1342f605f6c2aae82a768973be"><gtr:id>44c43e1342f605f6c2aae82a768973be</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones David W.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780415502177</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/21E853BD-5434-41A1-997D-39E3E786EF8D"><gtr:id>21E853BD-5434-41A1-997D-39E3E786EF8D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Beyond Typologies: Foregrounding Meaning and Motive in Domestic Violence Perpetration</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Deviant Behavior</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5fdf7c9bdc3e701afa6aa3c34d796582"><gtr:id>5fdf7c9bdc3e701afa6aa3c34d796582</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gadd D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/86EF05C9-10D9-406A-967C-86AF8BB9C910"><gtr:id>86EF05C9-10D9-406A-967C-86AF8BB9C910</gtr:id><gtr:title>Moral insanity and psychological disorder: the hybrid roots of psychiatry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>History of Psychiatry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4ed6f4f497449fe1878010c3b6afd47e"><gtr:id>4ed6f4f497449fe1878010c3b6afd47e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000911/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7DBCDE7-FDA2-465A-8338-1DA4AD7B221D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Forensic Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
