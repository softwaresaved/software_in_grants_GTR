On the surface, this seems a simple enough problem where the hard you force the fluid, the quicker it flows. In practice this turns out only to be true up to moderate forcing rates. After this turbulence - chaotic mixing flow - begins to be observed, and this greatly reduces the efficiency. In theory it is possible to avoid triggering turbulence as it is only initiated by disturbances above a certain amplitude. Knowledge of this critical amplitude tells us how smooth the pipe needs to be to avoid turbulence. For classical fluids, such as water and oil, this critical amplitude has recently been calculated and is very low indeed - so low that in practice it may be entirely impossible to avoid turbulence for anything above moderate flow rates. This presents a major obstacle for the engineering community.

Instead of seeking to avoid turbulence altogether, one possible solution is to change the characteristics of the observed turbulence hence mitigating the problem. Adding small quantities of polymers to a fluid can change its fundamental properties. In this way it is possible to create a shear thinning fluid - one which becomes less viscous as it is forced through a pipe. Counter-intuitively, reducing the viscosity of classical fluids can actually exacerbate the problem of turbulence by reducing further the size of disturbance required to initiate turbulence. However, shear-thinning fluids actually exhibit two types of turbulence. As well as the usual turbulence observed for oil or water, there is also an intermediate `weak turbulence' that has a much smaller impact on pumping efficiency. One practical means of maintaining a good throughput in a pipe would be to constrain the flow to this little understood weakly turbulent state, as a compromise between the highly efficient smooth flow and the uneconomic strong turbulence. 

This proposal seeks to explore and understand the weak state and to find conditions for holding off turbulence. The weakly turbulent state has a simple form of two streaks, one fast one slow, each occupying half the pipe's cross-section and with no variation along the pipe. Superimposed on this are slow, weak fluctuations. This gentle form and variation is attractive for a theoretical approach. Where previous attempts have looked - and struggled - to make progress by making the linear simplification, this project will tackle the full nonlinear problem.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this grant can be broadly split into three categories - individuals, industry and the public. Full details of how this will be achieved is included in the Pathways to Impact statement. Below is a summary of what will be done.

Individuals
The principle individuals to benefit from this work will be academics and students including those working on the project, those across the University and those in wider academic fields. The PDRA will gain experience in a number of technical skills as well as developing professional skills. They will also be an integrated member of the Centre for Flow Measurement and Fluid Mechanics
(CFMFM) and benefit from being submerged in a research driven environment. Student within the university will also benefit from the proposal as it will create opportunities for project students to be exposed to working as part of a research team.

Most importantly, this project seeks to bring cutting edge techniques to a wider audience. To this end the researchers will create and maintain an open website to aid academics and students seeking to apply these techniques to their own work. By doing so, the aim is to provide the initial step up to allow researchers to readily implement these ideas in their own fields.

Industry
The researchers will seek to find and aid industrial partners who wish to measure the flow rate of complex fluids. The CFMFM is already well connected to these fields with partners at TUV-NEL and the Flow Measurement Institute. Through these connections, we will seek to inform flow measurement techniques.

The general public
Non-Newtonian fluids can behave in very strange and counter-intuitive ways. As such they can capture the attention and the imagination of members of the public both young and old, provoking surprise and curiosity. In this grant we will seek to capitalise on this by making a small scale experiment to demonstrate these effects. This experiment will then be used at public outreach events to introduce fluid dynamics and complex fluids to a wider audience, engaging them in STEM matters. Royal Society training in media skills will make this as effective as possible.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99278</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P021352/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9767B5B6-94F7-4DF6-8415-C15629D67796</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complex fluids &amp; soft solids</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>53CC8ACD-11A0-48ED-8743-F66E9A657C12</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fluid Dynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
