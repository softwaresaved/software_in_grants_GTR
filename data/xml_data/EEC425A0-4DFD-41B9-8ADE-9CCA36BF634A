The project will initially provide an update event in the form of a one day conference for local teachers and trainee teachers in Kent. It will be delivered in the style of the Institute of Physics (IOP) teacher update courses, of which the applicants have experience of running. This one day conference will introduce new scientific concepts and knowledge to teachers whilst also enhancing their understanding of some basic physics concepts through the use of exciting and relevant talks and workshops based on the Centre for Astronomy and Planetary Sciences research into small solar system bodies. This covers research previously funded by STFC and current research that is fully compatible with the STFC UK Roadmap for Solar System Research, as well as including the very relevant and topical Rosetta mission. The conference will take the format of a train the trainer event, where the participants will be empowered to take their knowledge back to the classroom and effectively facilitate discussions and participation with space science research within their classrooms and laboratories using our workshop materials. 
Workshop materials will be produced in advance of the conference and refined based on feedback given at this time. These will then be made available to teachers all over the UK via the National STEM e-Library. This will be promoted through a number of routes including the Institute of Physics publication Classroom Physics allowing the project to have a wide reach. The project will promote interaction between real scientists involved in a current, well publicised, space mission with school teachers, providing insight into mission involvement at Kent, careers in science and the UK space programme. This project also aims to provide young postgraduate students with an opportunity to develop scientific communication skills including workshop development, presenting and writing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>For this project, dissemination will be the key factor if it is to reach the intended audience beyond the teachers attending our update event. As the project has many aspects to it the dissemination will be done in several ways. 
Firstly by using the train the trainer approach not only will the teachers that attend our update event become more knowledgeable and confident when discussing scientific research in particular with small solar system bodies, the project will allow them to take that knowledge and pass it on to their students. Based on the estimate of 30 teachers attending our update event we would conservatively say that they would then in turn use the workshop resources to run a workshop for one of their physics cohorts (an estimate of 20 students per teacher).
Having had success before publishing within Classroom Physics and Education in Science we are confident that the resources and ideas in their final form (incorporating teacher and student feedback) could be publicised in the aforementioned education magazines and reach teachers nationally. By posting the resources in the National STEM e-Library we can add links to these publications so teachers can download the resource pack. Classroom Physics is sent as a physical magazine to 1870 physics teachers in the UK and the ASE publication Education in Science is published quarterly to members of ASE. Classroom physics is also sent out electronically. This will give the resources plenty of exposure to Physics teachers in the UK. Due to the applicants links with SEPnet, the resources can be disseminated to the other 8 university outreach officers for use in schools and also to be sent out on any teacher mailing lists. Dr Mason is a part of the IOP schools outreach support network which links outreach and school liaison officers all over the UK. This will provide another possible route for dissemination of the link to the resources.
Successful dissemination of the resource pack therefore has the potential to reach hundreds of teachers and thousands of students. The train the trainer approach alongside the dissemination methods give this project the possibility of significant impact via a potential multiplier effect.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8434</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Technician Conference at Worthing College West Sussex</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D93059F4-1191-4E50-997A-DD79E5681788</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Activity: Introducing experiments and teaching resources developed, based on small solar system body research.

Reach: 10 technicians from 9 schools in East and West Sussex.

The session was designed to introduce newly developed teaching resources including practical ideas to bring small solar system body research into the classroom. 10 technicians took part in the 90 minute workshop where they experienced three new practical experiments developed to demonstrate how information about asteroid shape and spin rate is gathered by scientists. As this was the first time the activities were trialled with participants, it lead to some great feedback about how to ensure all abilities were able to participate, how to offer high and low tech versions of the practical sessions and how to develop the resources further so that teachers would have the confidence to use them in the classroom. Also discussed were the many different links to the current key stage 3 and 4 curriculum and the other areas of science that the experiments could be used to develop understanding of. Once resources are finalised equipment and resources will be sent to the participants of this conference and hopefully used within the schools. A further evaluation into the use of the resources will be undertaken at a later date.

Most significant outcome was for the development of the resources and new links formed in schools in a region not local to institution.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Asteroid Workshops for Ursuline College Skills Event, Kent</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA535E2C-4280-415C-AA4B-B3F3C85B3A91</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Activity: A trial of the practical session with 4 classes of year 9 students (80 students in total).

Reach: 44 11-14 year olds and 38 15-18 year olds (63 Key stage 3/4, 19 Key stage 5) from across the UK.

This was the first trial of the practical activities with young people from a wide range of ages. An introductory lecture and then a 2 hour workshop allowed the students to trial all practical activities and provide feedback for improvements. It also allowed 8 undergraduate physics student helpers to experience the practical activities alongside students and also provide feedback on student engagement and suitability for age range.

Most significant outcome was the feedback on the resources and also engaging young people with real research methods.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Asteroid Workshops for Whitstable Community College, Whitstable, Kent</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D57E98AF-3D1C-4A64-9AE7-AA43ECA45164</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Activity: A trial of the practical session for two classes of year 9 students (60 in total) and two classes of year 11 students (50 in total).

Reach: 6 teachers from 6 schools in Kent and London

The activity aimed to bring local teachers up to date with a current space mission and highlight the involvement of their local University. It also aimed to introduce practical ideas to bring small solar system body research into their classroom. The event was very well received and once again further feedback was garnered to develop the resources further to the point where they could be used independently by teachers in their classrooms. Links were made with new schools and since the event the outreach team has sent resources to three of the schools, and trialled the practical activities and lesson plans in two of the schools for a range of year groups. Feedback from the students has been used to produce a finalised version of the teaching resources. The lectures at this event based on the Rosetta mission and other areas of small solar system body research lead to a lengthy Q and A/ discussion session afterwards and real engagement from the teachers. 

Most significant outcome was developing new links with schools and teachers in order to trial the resources on students.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/M006700/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
