These twelfth-century English accusations of ritual crucifixion are unique for several reasons: first and foremost, because they are the first of their kind. Secondly, because royal, civic, and ecclesiastical authorities all declared that these accusations were nonsense, and they stopped. The related accusations of blood libel and host desecration do not appear until the 1290s, in the Holy Roman Empire and France respectively, the latter occurring in the year that England expelled its entire Jewish population.\n\nThis book will attempt to account for why this should be so, by examining the rhetorical techniques of the texts in which that these accounts of ritual crucifixion survive. There are only four narratives of ritual crucifixion: the most famous is the long vita of William of Norwich, but there are also shorter vita of Robert of Bury St Edmunds, Adam of Bristol, and Robert of Gloucester contained in local monastic chronicles. This study will highlight two central aspects shared by these texts. Firstly, that although they are announced as, and so have been treated by historians as, accusations of ritual crucifixion, in fact the actions that these narratives tentatively describe are not, strictly speaking, ritual crucifixions. In each case, what these narratives describe is not quite / or perhaps not exclusively / a crucifixion. Moreover, each of these narratives contains structural elements that do not belong to the Passion narrative, specifically tortures by fire and water. This suggests that these narratives are drawing on the contemporary procedures of judicial ordeal in their depictions of these ritual crucifixions. \n\nSecondly, it will suggest that the presence of the elements of judicial ordeal in these narratives is related to a crisis in the category of proof in the twelfth century. It argues that these representations of ritual crucifixion / in their narrative insistence on the importance of proving the occurrence of an act that has not been witnessed / ultimately speak as much to a cultural shift in the mid-twelfth century in conceptualizing the relationship between seeing and believing, between knowledge and faith, as they do to Christian/Jewish relations and the emergence of racially based discourses of antisemitism in the Middle Ages.\n\nFinally, it will examine the afterlife of these representations, which, although in many ways quite specific to the intellectual climate of the twelfth-century renaissance, continued to have important reverberations. It will demonstrate how this twelfth-century crisis of epistemology came to determine the future history of literary representations of the Jews, examining in particular this influence of visual witnessing that comes out of these texts on representations of the Jews in the visual arts (especially in representations of the eucharist and host desecration) and on the medieval stage, where I will suggest the frequent appearance of Jews owes a great deal to this twelfth-century centering of the body of the Jew as a privileged site of visual proof.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-07-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16222</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F005083/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>950E3601-19AF-48B8-9030-FB18B0E0FB1A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medieval Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
