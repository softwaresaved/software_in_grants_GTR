The Welsh Assembly has been granted a range of powers and policy levers that are relevant to achieving these objectives. But it does not currently have the same powers and responsibilities as the Scottish Government or many comparable regions/small countries in Europe and beyond. It also faces particular challenges associated with the delivery of public services (including health, education and transport) and the management of natural resources across its long and relatively densely populated border with England.

The research will analyse the powers and policy levers that are used by governments in comparable countries/regions and study how these have been used to best effect. It will assess the implications of this evidence from other regions/countries for policy makers in Wales and consider what, if any, additional powers would be likely to assist Welsh Ministers to achieve their policy objectives. It will also study how governments elsewhere manage the cross-border delivery of key public services, with a particular focus on experience from countries/regions which have a strong degree of economic, social and political integration with larger neighbours.

The study will combine reviews of the relevant academic and policy literature; the generation of new evidence through interviews with key policy makers; workshops with international academic experts to draw on experience and expertise from other regions/countries; and a programme of knowledge exchange with Ministers, special advisers and officials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Direct beneficiaries of the research will include Welsh Ministers and their advisers and officials. It will also benefit policy makers in the UK Government by increasing understanding of the management of cross border delivery of public services, and it will be of indirect interest to policy makers in other parts of the UK who are involved in constitutional change and devolution, including the proposed city regions in England. It will indirectly benefit users in local government and health service managers in Wales by helping to inform the way in which the Welsh Government works with them. By helping the Welsh Government to maximise the effectiveness of its initiatives to promote economic growth, improve public services and tackle poverty, the research should benefit the people of Wales by securing better policy making and improved outcomes.

There is an on-going debate about the sustainability of the current devolution settlement, and two high profile commissions (on Devolution in Wales and on Public Service Governance and Delivery) have produced recommendations with potentially far reaching implications. In addition, the Smith Commission's proposals could have significant knock-on effects for Wales with outline decisions on the devolution of new powers for Wales due to be announced by 1st March 2015. 

The process of constitutional change and devolution has, therefore, reached a pivotal point in Wales. The possibility of devolution of further powers from Westminster to the Welsh Government, combined with fundamental changes in the relationship between the Welsh Government and local government in Wales, presents new challenges for policy makers. In this context, Welsh Ministers need to know how to make best use of the powers and policy levers that are available to them; what new powers, if any, might help them to achieve their objectives; and how to work with the UK Government to manage the cross-border delivery of key public services including health, education and transport and the management of natural resources.

The distinctiveness of the Welsh context and devolution process means that the results of studies of constitutional change in Scotland cannot simply be 'read across' to Wales. There is a need for research specifically focused on Wales to contribute evidence that helps to inform policy - at devolved and UK level. The proposed study will provide new evidence and a platform for future research. 

Senior Welsh Government officials have helped to design the research from the outset, and the First Minister for Wales and members of his Cabinet have been consulted on the study's objectives and have endorsed the need for it. Welsh Ministers, their advisers and officials will continue to be involved at all stages in the research. The proposed interviews and knowledge exchange and dissemination activities will ensure co-production of the knowledge and a high level of awareness and uptake of the research findings. Through his role as the Director of the Public Policy Institute for Wales (PPIW), the Principal Investigator has regular meetings with the First Minister for Wales and other members of the Welsh Government. The research will, therefore, engage directly with senior politicians and officials and feed directly into policy debates and decisions. The PPIW's Board of Governors are also influential opinion formers whose involvement will help enhance impact, and the PI has excellent access to senior officers of the Welsh Local Government Association and senior managers in the Health Service which will help facilitate engagement with local service providers. In addition, the PPIW is part of the What Works network which will provide opportunities for engagement and impact outside of Wales, particularly through its contact with What Works Scotland.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159064</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The development of housing and homelessness policy in Wales: An expert policy reunion</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B69A1831-8D5C-4DE3-95B2-95DF5AF38EEF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On Friday 10 February 2017 the Public Policy Institute for Wales (PPIW) held a policy reunion at which key actors in the development and implementation of Part 2 of the Housing Wales Act 2014 ('the 2014 legislation') discussed and reflected upon their experiences. The reunion forms part of a case study of the development and implementation of recent Welsh homelessness policy, which sits within a wider programme of research by the Public Policy Institute for Wales (PPIW), funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), into the nature and use of the powers and policy levers available to the Welsh Government. 
Seven participants ('witnesses'), from the public and third sectors, academia, and the wider Welsh housing policy community, took part in the reunion. All had been interviewed by PPIW in summer 2016 as part of the main data gathering stage of the case study, and were subsequently invited to participate in the reunion on the basis of PPIW's judgement about the importance of their contribution to the making and implementation of the legislation. Of those originally invited, one was unable to participate; another participant was identified slightly later and did participate. Professor Steve Martin, of the PPIW, chaired the discussion, and Professor Alex Marsh, of Bristol University, acted as academic discussant. Dr Andrew Connell and Dr Emily St Denny of the PPIW were also in attendance.
All witnesses were still active within the Welsh housing policy community, and had been asked when they accepted their invitations whether they would be willing for the discussion to be held on the record. Some replied that if it were, they might feel inhibited from speaking openly. The reunion was therefore conducted under the 'Chatham House Rule' of non-attributability. This is a departure from the usual practice of policy reunions, which are commonly designed to produce data upon which scholars can draw, but in this case the PPIW considered that it was an acceptable condition to ensure a free and honest discussion. 
A report of the policy reunion is currently being compiled and we also intend to write a reflective methodological article, drawing on our experience of running this reunion as a tool for contemporary policy analysis.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Expert workshop on 'Impriving policy delivery in Wales, the evidence'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>29629DB1-DE81-4DA3-B5B1-41465FBB6ABB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 14 March 2016, the Public Policy Institute for Wales (PPIW) held a policy expert panel which brought together an invited group of public service experts and Welsh Government officials to identify and discuss the evidence needs for future public services. Participants included senior academics from across the UK, as well as representatives from Y Lab, the Early Intervention Foundation, What Works Scotland, the Institute of Government, the Office for Public Management, the Public Services Transformation Network, Wales Public Services 2025 and Welsh Government. The panel discussed four themes of central importance to the future of public service delivery in Wales: public service improvement; innovation; place-based approaches and service integration; and user engagement and co-production. The primary impact and contribution of this event came from asking participants to identify the evidence and evidence needs in respect of these issues, so that these may be prioritised and addressed by government and policy analysts. This was crucial to help Ministers identify and meet their evidence needs. The outcomes of the expert panel were then used to inform the work different actors, and especially the PPIW, went on to do to reduce the evidence gap in these areas.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ppiw.org.uk/exploring-the-evidence-needs-of-future-public-services-ppiw-expert-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N00745X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B8E7153C-9FE1-4987-A37B-98408DC227F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public Administration</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
