It is based on current inter-disciplinary behavioural change work to generate practical insights to inform policy and institutional design.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It begins by assessing interventions to mitigate public harm or detriment in other unrelated spheres. Secondly, it looks at how far attitudinal change and behavioural change are interconnected, and specifically the degree to which attitudinal change serves as a pre-requisite to behavioural change. Thirdly, it considers the implications for policymaking in three regards: sustaining behavioural change relevant to equalities outcomes; relationships between background factors that indirectly shape decision-making and choices and foreground factors that can be influenced through policy; and third, targeting hard-to-move individuals, groups and interests.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will be based on multiple methods. These include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>a desk-based interim analytical report, using published and grey literature&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>engagement with GEO senior officials and existing projects (eg Public Sector Equality Duty)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>stakeholder discussions with OGDs and regulatory agencies&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>exchange with academic and practitioner experts&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>dialogue with ministers and others to shape future equalities strategy.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impacts of the KEF will be six-fold:

? The importance of identifying the end goal: do you want reform or do you want change?
? The radical potential in disrupting the norm by making equality-focussed processes and behaviours the default.
? It was suggested that what sometimes gets in the way of improved outcomes is the intuitive and the personal, for example in explaining why more people don't declare a disability. 
? As well as rules, incentives and information identified in the model, we should add relationships as a fourth pillar. 
? There was discussion about the relationship between attitudes and behaviour, including in the context of the recent global summit on sexual violence and discrepancies in approaches to protecting women abroad and in the UK.
? There was also discussion about the role of incentives and how to avoid the problem of providing incentives to bring about improvements that don't disappear if the incentive is removed. Rather than use incentives, it was suggested a better approach is to specify the behaviour that is expected and impose penalties for non-compliance. 
? If you want to change attitudes, sometimes it helps to do it indirectly by nesting one cause inside other issues that people care about. This can help detoxify an issue. 
? The importance of changing language as part of changing attitudes was highlighted.
? It was suggested that chief executives have a level of power in changing norms that they often fail to use.
? A straw poll of participants suggested that most, though not all those present thought behavioural change insights have a role in improving equality outcomes. 

Closing remarks by seminar chair - Amanda Ariss, Chief Executive, EDF
Amanda summed up some of the points that had struck her including: the role of incentives; the distinction between doing what we're doing now a bit better and doing something different - or stopping doing something; and the widespread recognition that this model is one among a range of tools for anyone seeking to create real change.

The findings have been used in three principal ways:
* As fresh ideas and practical challenges developed to improve the overall strategic capability of the Government Equalities Unit and its wider reputation for creativity and innovation across different Whitehall departments.
* As a set of new perspectives on how improved equalities outcomes can be pursued to raise the awareness and capabilities of equalities practitioners (e.g. ECU and EDF).
* As an accelerator of commercial-driven efforts to innovate to better serve female entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs (e.g. through follow up discussions with the Barclays Behavioural Finance team).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A9834795-5F73-463A-9AFA-1A962EB8398B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Background and context

The KEF was developed into a significant project within the Government Equalities Office (GEO), entitled 'Complementary and Alternative Paths to Equality' (CAPE). The Fellow lead the project supported by the part-time assistance of an Assistant Economist. The CAPE project was structured into three phases: the research and analytical phase (January-March); the development of a policy consulting tool (April-August); and an applied phase linking to three on-going policy commitments held be GEO, and to creating fresh capabilities in DCMS's Evidence and Analysis Unit (EAU). 

A significant machinery of government (MOG) change was implemented half way through the CAPE project as GEO transferred from Home Office sponsorship to DCMS sponsorship, creating various delays in reporting, accountabilities and specification of the policy consulting phase. The project lead reported in to GEO's deputy director for research and analysis (while based at Home Office) and to GEO's head of research and the deputy director of EAU (based in DCMS).





Summary of project findings

There are three main findings:
1) The project showed that various behaviour change (BC) insights, drawn from a variety of sources, have significant relevance and appeal to equalities policy and strategy. The project developed an easy to use theory of change aimed at policymakers on a routine basis that was based on suitable BC insights.

2) The project identified and drove various applications of behavior change to three jointly identified policy commitments held by GEO. 

o Think, Act, Report. This is a flagship policy of GEO designed to encourage greater corporate business adoption of modern equalities practices. The project highlighted adaptations based strengthening leadership among businesses using peer and norm effects, sharpening the offer in a crowded field, and pooling learning from comparable unrelated schemes run by government.

o Engaging with smaller businesses. The project identified key recommendations that flexed the approach of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) - by distinguishing between compliance with legal obligations as against best practice, greater exploitation of GEO's existing private sector road show events, and the promotion of suitable messages about upcoming Equal Pay Audits (EPAs).

o Women in Enterprise. This amounted to the area of greatest traction building on the work of the Women's Business Council (WBC) and HMT-led and BIS-led cross-government initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and growth. The project highlighted significant potential among financial lenders in particular to adapt and sensitise the approach to would-be female entrepreneurs. The project thereafter directly led on the development of a suitable strategy by a leading UK bank.

3) The project enabled a step change in the capability of the department's EAU to incorporate behaviour change ideas and tools in responding to policy challenges. The final report, in addition, highlighted a number of 'Key lessons for policy-making' aimed at a cross-departmental audience across a range of policy teams. Further, GEO and DCMS participation in the Cross Government Network on Behaviour Change was a final specific outcome driven by CAPE. The inclusion of EAU's deputy director in the project's ownership structure signified the successful adaptation of the project to the new DCMS environment after the MOG change.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Potential use in non-academic contexts

There are plans to exploit the research and policy design work carried out during the project in several areas. Currently these include collaboration with Demos, a national think tank, on a pamphlet on 'Nudging integration'; a short paper and presentation to the annual conference of the Equality Challenge Unit; and various presentations to the German Federal Ministry of Civic Education, the Dialogue Society, the IPPR Everyday Integration steering group, and an ESRC Research Centre on Micro-social Change Symposium on Individual Interests and Collective Values.
 
Exploitation routes

The CAPE project is unusual in that the work was carried out in close proximity to research and policy users within government. It was sponsored by a small cross-government unit with lead responsibility for equalities across a number of departmental and policy boundaries.

The project was designed from the outset to support several of GEO's core aims such as: strengthening GEO's policy design capability and interventions; improving GEO's ability to deliver its policy outcomes; and enhancing GEO's reputation for thought leadership and innovation across Whitehall. In addition, following GEO's absorption into DCMS, the project played a timely part in developing new capabilities in the department's evidence and analysis team (EAU). In these respects, the project was positioned to take advantage of several fast-moving, internal exploitation opportunities.

A number of these opportunities were exploited either through direct outputs or through on-going advice and consulting. Examples include:

? 'CAPE: interim report'. This was finalized three months into the project and contained the main analytical framework and supporting literature for the subsequent applied phases of work with specific policy teams.

? New GEO sponsored BSA questions on attitudes to equality. The project provided detailed advice on suitable questions based on framing, messaging and default BC insights.

? Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) Review. The project provided on-going support to the Review Team particularly in relation to theories of change and regulatory policy models.

? 'Top Behaviour Change Insights for DCMS analysts'. A short paper and presentation geared to the needs of the EAU officials.

? 'Behaviour Change and Equalities: Top Ten Insights and Levers'. Short paper and presentation to DCMS analysts and policy teams.

? 'Behaviour Change EAU Knowledge Bank' - detailed and annotated electronic file for EAU officials for future development of BC tools across DCMS.

? 'Top Five Tips for Successful Academic Secondments to Whitehall'. The Fellow and a GEO assistant economist prepared this report in order to assist in improving future knowledge exchange type opportunities and maximize use of external expertise. A shorter version of this paper by the Fellow will be offered to the ESRC for inclusion on the 'Impact Toolkit' part of its website.

? 'Equality 2.0'. Final report of the CAPE project. This was finalized in December and published by DCMS in March 2014.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FD2067D2-C006-44D3-99F3-239DC8F10839</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cape-behaviour-change-nudge-insights-in-equalities-policy</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Reference paper for the Public Sector Equality Duty Review Steering Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>81323509-2F9D-487A-B0AE-B92E96DF889B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The reference paper enabled the Steering Group to understand and appreciate different regulatory models in considering the implementation effects of the PSED.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Top Ten Tips for Successful Academic Secondments to Whitehall - Advisory Paper to DCMS and GEO</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DBAD31E2-EEAA-4FE4-906B-A4396067EC53</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The paper and presentation to DCMS and GEO highlighted key lessons for better use of future potential academic secondments.
