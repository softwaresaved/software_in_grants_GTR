Currently, within the UK based power generation industry, there are no design tools available that have the capability to optimise the design of cluttered enclosures for noise reduction at minimum manufacturing cost, in addressing the noise directive 2000/14/EC. Quantitative information about the performance at conceptual design stage is not known. Expensive mock-ups have to be manufactured to determine their performance, which adversely affects the lead-time and profits. Virtual acoustic validation and costing of manufacture for early conceptual design of power generating sets is very challenging. Specifically there are no tools on the market that link conceptual design parameters, acoustic analysis of those parameters and manufacturing cost. The market targeted for the project is the power generation industry, specifically sound attenuated generator sets, which is highly competitive and globally worth an estimated 2.7billion for products up to 2000kVA. The combination of Industry and Academia in this project will ensure an integrated capability for merging a virtual design and validation process, in terms of noise and manufacturing cost. The project will be led by FG Wilson using 6 Sigma DMEDI methodology. Having this capability at the design stage will result in a new understanding of the product, hence optimised performance weighted against cost. The developed flexible parametric design interface will provide a user-friendly platform to use the toolkit. The mix of partners involved in this project in terms of their role, expertise and strategic motivation has been a major consideration in setting up the consortium. The overall balance of partners includes large users, SMEs, software tool developers and academic experts. This mix represents a group of partners who each have a strong personal motivation in the project. The technical approach will involve the use of computational Indirect Boundary Element (IBE) and experimental approaches to simulate the radiation and scattering of the sound generated and transmitted through an enclosed diesel generator set, which includes an engine, an alternator, and cooling fans. In addition, methods for noise and vibration reduction based on damping and using multi-layer acoustic liner will be developed and implemented. LMS UK Ltd will supply their comprehensive suite of software for acoustic predictions and undertake development, while FG Wilson, the lead organisation, will supply generator sets, of different power ratings. Externally, a Ground Power Unit (GPU) supplied by Houchin Aerospace, will be used as an independent validation exercise. In general, this technology will be highly generic with wide scope ranging from automotive, aerospace, railway and marine through to the construction industry where trade-off in the cost of environmental noise reduction is such a relevant issue. The key innovation of this project hinges on the capture and exploitation of expert knowledge, from multiple technical disciplines, under one environment using numerical modelling techniques, empirical algorithms, industrial manufacturing cost data modelling, and experimentation for evaluation and design data generation for next stage. This will provide engineers with a tangible environment from which to synthetically design inherently cluttered enclosed generator sets, meeting lead-time, competitive cost targets and noise legislative targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>320286</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this project is to develop a multidisciplinary 'design tool' that encompasses the state-of-the art knowledge in noise source identification and transmission from enclosed generator sets, for more competitive environmental noise performance. Based on this aim, the following objectives, the measurable targets, have been developed:
1. Capture state-of-the-art knowledge in noise source identification and transmission and expertise to enable Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) of the design process.
2. Development, calibration and testing of a new fan model for fan noise modelling
3. Identification of noise sources and prediction through complex impedance paths.
4. Competitive cost for improved environmental noise performance, through modelling of the manufacturing cost impact of design changes.
5. Application of this knowledge to obtain competitive environmental noise performance and to achieve lead time reduction through design and analysis compression.
6. Verification and validation of the resulting design tool through a number of case studies.
The aim and most of the objectives were met by the end of the project, which has been reported previously. Couple of things are worth to mention again: 
? A newly proposed Fan Model to capture noise contribution from cooling fans was developed, validated by experiments and implemented in the specially tailored LMS Virtual Lab. 
? Sound transmission loss through single panels and multi-layer partitions have been studied and modelled. As a result, the products of one partner in the consortium (Master's Choice), portable acoustic partitions, have been dramatically improved. The best performance of sound transmission loss has been improved from 34 dB to 54 dB. The certificate for this has been obtained for the company.
? At the same time, a certificate for fire resistant has been obtained for the company as well.
Interest was also shown in the cost model developed. The demonstrator of the model has been past to the industrial partners in the consortium.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>17031AAD-35FE-4F79-99B7-5865B324670E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>What have you discovered or developed through the research funded on this grant?
