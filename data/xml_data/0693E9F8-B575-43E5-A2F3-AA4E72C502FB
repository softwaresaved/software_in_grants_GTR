Domestic gardens offer a valuable source of green infrastructure (GI) within an urban environment. They are important patches of greenspace that can provide connectivity between larger areas of GI (parks, recreation grounds etc), therefore improving the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide, such as reducing surface water runoff thereby reducing flood risk, and lowering urban temperatures. While individually, a domestic garden may appear insignificant, collectively domestic gardens contribute up to 30% of greenspace within the urban matrix, which becomes especially important at the city scale. In spite of this, the quantity and quality of green infrastructure provision by domestic gardens is not well-evidenced. This has implications for the future resilience of an urban environment and the health and well-being of its citizens. Current data over-estimates the amount of vegetation within private gardens, which leads to subsequent inaccuracies in environmental model outputs (e.g. surface water runoff in an extreme rainfall event), and in the identification and prioritisation of areas of GI need, inhibiting effective action on-the-ground. Furthermore, the general public are often unaware of the environmental value of their own private garden and how they can improve it.

This project will address these issues directly by:
1. Inviting city residents to complete an online survey about their own garden, the results of which will be amalgamated to create maps of domestic garden greenspace both in terms of quantity and quality. Survey respondents will be given a score for the environmental quality of their garden based on their responses to the survey, together with some information as to how their garden could be improved in relation to biodiversity, climate regulation and improving air quality.
2. Validating the survey responses using high resolution satellite data. The combination of the satellite data with the survey responses will be used to establish a classification scheme for different garden types, which can then be extrapolated to the wider city area.
3. Modelling how the vegetation within a domestic garden impacts surface runoff, temperature reduction and air quality. This will be done across multiple scales, from an individual garden to the neighbourhood-level and eventually at the city-scale.
4. Developing an action plan for GI solutions within the city based on the findings from the previous objectives and existing, larger-scale, green infrastructure datasets.

Manchester is the test city for this project; the proposal has been developed in partnership with Manchester City Council, Red Rose Forest, Southway Housing, Lancashire Wildlife Trust and additional members of the Manchester a Certain Future Green Infrastructure Strategy Group (Environment Agency, BDP, Groundwork, National Trust). The project outputs will allow these end-users to develop a more robust plan for GI under current and future climate scenarios. Consequently, project outputs will contribute to enhancing the quality of life for the local population and to improving the resilience of the Manchester City environment. Further impact will occur at the individual level (improving individual gardens based on the survey feedback, strengthening community cohesion), neighbourhood-level (the evidence created can be used for biodiversity/GI/ES offsetting for new housing developments, housing associations will use the project outputs for improving neighbourhoods and access to green space) and stakeholder-level (private developers can use the outputs to add value to residential areas and development, third sector organisations can use the maps for developing policy recommendations and actions).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is anticipated to have significant impact at the city-scale. The project will quantify the amount of GI within domestic gardens in a UK urban environment and the role of this GI in relation to regulating ES. This information will feed into the GI Action Plan, to fit within partners' existing delivery mechanisms, and consequently, will provide end-users with the evidence demonstrating the importance of domestic gardens within the greater GI network. Co-creation of the GI Action Plan with project partners is designed to ensure that domestic gardens become integral to GI planning within Manchester City, and beyond, through dissemination of the project outcomes by project partners and the research team. Specific project impacts include:
- Manchester City Council will use the project outcomes (D1.3, D2.2, D3.1, D3.2) and the GI Action Plan (D4.1) to inform the delivery of their Green and Blue Infrastructure Strategy. The GI Action Plan (D4.1) will ensure consideration of the contribution of GI in domestic gardens in GI planning.
- Local Authorities (in particular Manchester City Council, but also other UK Local Authorities) can use the project outcomes (D2.1; D4.1) for negotiating planning obligations under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The project outputs will provide the evidence needed for local planning authorities to impose 'developer contributions', particularly in identified areas of GI-ES need.
- Southway Housing Trust will use the project outcomes to inform and engage their residents (D1.2) and improve their green space in areas of GI-need (D3.2). They will also disseminate these outcomes and the GI Action Plan (D4.1) to other housing providers to extend the delivery of GI in particular areas of GI-need. 
- The online GI-ES survey feedback (D1.2) provided to residents will allow them to measure the environmental quality of their individual garden and will provide them with clear guidance to improve the environmental value of their garden. This will provide the respondent with an incentive to respond positively to the survey and enhance community cohesion.
- This online GI-ES survey feedback (D1.2) will enable residents to add value to their properties and gain important knowledge on green space in their area to partake in planning consultations. 
- Red Rose Forest, Lancashire Wildlife Trust and other third sector organisations will use the project outcomes (D1.3, D2.2, D3.1, D3.2) to evidence and shape their work, and develop policy recommendations and actions (D4.1).
- Project outcomes (D2.1; D4.1) can be used for biodiversity/GI/ES offsetting for new housing developments. Private developers could use the tool to add value to residential areas and development. These end-users will be reached through project partner networks (e.g. Southway Housing, Manchester City Council) and the MACF GI Strategy Group's networks.
- The GI-ES survey (D1.1) and infrastructure created in developing the tool (D1.2) is designed to be fully transferable across the UK (and further afield). Thus, the approach could be applied to other cities, widening these benefits. Indeed, the Mersey Forest intend to extend the approach across North West England in the first instance.
- The project outputs will contribute to enhancing the quality of life for the local population and to improving the resilience of the urban environment (D1.2; D4.1).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96813</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>My Back Yard website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA0F41AD-4170-4C41-A8FF-05A181CD387E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 'My Back Yard' project website was primarily established to collect survey responses for the project as well as to inform the public about the benefits of domestic gardens and enable viewing of survey responses.

After data cleaning to remove incomplete and duplicate responses, over 1000 survey responses for Manchester were obtained. On completion of the survey, participants were given a summary of the results to date for their ward (in relation to garden composition), in addition to feedback on how they can improve the ecosystem service regulating functions in their own gardens. The intention here was to educate the public about the impact that domestic greenspace can have at the local and regional level, in relation to climate impacts, biodiversity and air quality. Respondents were also asked if they were willing to pledge their support by agreeing to take action in order to improve the ecosystem services of their garden. Of the respondents, 252 agreed to plant a variety of plant types to help attract and support a range of wildlife, 228 pledged to use drought-resistant plants and collect water in their garden to use for watering during hot dry spells, around 150 households agreed to plant trees to provide shade and to help cool the air in summer and to improve local air quality and over 100 pledged to replace existing hard surfaces with surfaces that water can drain through.

A summary of the key results from the survey has been provided to the Project Partners (Manchester City Council, Southway Housing, Lancashire Wildlife Trust and Manchester City of Trees). This short report is designed to stimulate discussion ahead of the project's WP4 - the development of a GI action plan. This will be achieved through an iterative process comprising (1) online discussions, (2) bilateral meetings, and (3) workshops amongst the project partners. The first task which is currently underway is to identify the project partners existing priorities relating to GI interventions and their delivery mechanisms for these interventions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E4868F63-E795-4B8E-A85F-2E5B49B98127</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database of 1000+ responses from the My Back yard survey, containing details about individual garden composition and qualitative and quantitative data about garden use.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FC137306-FF02-4EEA-A596-276C601F2E8C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This database is the result of a novel crowd sourcing method. The results of the survey are currently being validated through the use of high resolution remote sensing imagery. The database has been used to revise down the percentage (by 42-48%) of greenspace currently attributed to domestic gardens within Manchester's green infrastructure database. Given that around 22% of Manchester is garden space, this means the current overestimate for the whole of Manchester's greenspace translates to around 8-10%. These data corrections are being integrated into the green infrastructure database for Manchester which is used by our Project Partners and stakeholders beyond the research team.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>My Backyard Survey Results</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://mybackyard.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N017374/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>0693E9F8-B575-43E5-A2F3-AA4E72C502FB</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/N017374/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>96813.85</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>84D5E4B0-2157-4880-8C4E-D28FCE932B55</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/N017374/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>25243.98</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>95</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E03855F0-1A26-4F21-8789-578E6A9BAC49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape  Architecture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>396591D1-8226-43A9-991D-8E0D265D99D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Regional &amp; Extreme Weather</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AF20B57E-E40B-45BC-85C8-DDC6F4777697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Spatial Planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>648B790C-8CC1-40BA-B713-BF27B871D211</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
