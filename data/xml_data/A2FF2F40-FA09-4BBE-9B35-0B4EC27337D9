Nevertheless, the total area of mangroves continues to decline and mangroves are threatened by environmental degradation as natural resources are traded-off against population growth and economic development. The solution to mangrove degradation no longer lies in resource protection, but in fostering understanding that mangroves are embedded within a context of complex interactions of multiple uses involving stakeholders with different interests, i.e. the mangrove nexus.

Mangroves support highly productive fisheries, but mangrove destruction has severely affected the livelihoods of fishermen who are known to be among the most economically disadvantaged in Malaysia and many other developing countries. While efforts are made at many scales by different stakeholders against mangrove fishery loss, there has been a tendency for them to work in isolation with little communication between them. Opportunities for mangrove dependent fishing communities to engage in the management of the resource on which they depend have been limited.

Through an application of nexus thinking, this project will improve understanding of the interdependencies, tensions and trade-offs between the mangroves, their associated fishery and their users, in the context of human and environmental change. The Klang Islands mangrove forest will be used as a case study. This forest (ca. 15,000ha) forms part of a larger tract of mangrove forest stretching over 100km along the coast of the state of Selangor. The coastline maintains some of the most productive cockle and coastal fisheries in Malaysia. To support the continued and sustainable use of the Klang Islands fishery and the communities dependent upon them, this project has three aims: 1) to progress the application of nexus thinking to the sustainable management of Klang Island fishery resources; 2) to set the foundations for community-based fishery management in the Klang Islands mangrove system, 3) develop a programme of environmental education emphasising the importance of mangroves.

Working with three project partners (Penang Inshore Fishermen Welfare Association, Department of Fisheries, Selangor and Wetlands International) these aims will be achieved through a series of stakeholder workshops, supported by student projects and effective knowledge exchange. The project will initiate communication between stakeholders (fishermen, government, industry and NGOs) and begin a process of empowerment that will encourage fisheries dependent communities to directly participate in fishery resource management. This will directly support the mission &amp;quot;Creating a developed, independent and progressive fishermen community&amp;quot; outlined by the Fisheries Development Authority of Malaysia. It will also contribute to strengthening the participation of stakeholders and cooperation between planning and implementation agencies, one of four objectives identified for the implementation of coastal zone management since the Ninth Malaysia Plan. To ensure that this project legacy can be capitalised upon, the structure and mechanisms for ongoing community engagement projects will be established (e.g. appointment of appropriate local community heads, creation of lines of communication between local fishermen associations and local government, identification of roles for project partners).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to initiate long-term change within the Klang Islands mangrove fishery resource management in support of &amp;quot;Creating a developed, independent and progressive fishermen community&amp;quot; as outlined by the Fisheries Development Authority of Malaysia. To achieve this, the project will improve understanding of the interdependencies, tensions and trade-offs between the different uses and users of the mangroves and the associated fishery resources. In the medium-term, it will foster inclusive decision-making, build trust between the resource users and managers, and empower local fisher folk to participate in mangrove fishery resource management. In so doing, the project will evaluate opportunities for long-term livelihood diversification, seek to build resilience to future shocks and hazards, identify solutions that will increase food provision and the resilience of the economic activities in mangrove areas, and initiate a programme of environmental education that aims to increase the value perceived by society for mangrove-based fisheries products.

The Klang Islands fishers and their associated communities will be the main beneficiaries from this project. It is anticipated that other beneficiaries will include: state governmental departments of Selangor (Fisheries and Forestry), environmental NGOs (e.g. Wetlands International), local businesses (e.g. port authorities, tourism representatives), representatives of local fisheries associations (e.g. Penang Inshore Fishermen Welfare Association) and other users of the mangrove (e.g. aquaculture and agriculture). 

All stakeholders will benefit from clear, independent scientific information that will improve their understanding of the mangrove fishery nexus; how this may change as a result of projected climate change, future urbanisation and industrial growth; and the trade-offs between different uses and possible actions aimed at ensuring sustainable exploitation. Stakeholder interactions will initiate the co-design of community-based management for the Klang Islands mangrove fishery. Early participation of stakeholders in the design and development of project activities (workshops and student projects) should facilitate stakeholder ownership, co-design of outputs and ensure that generating impact is an integral component of the research programme. 

Key outputs from the project will include: 1) Diagrammatic representation of the mangrove nexus including information on mangrove use, users, values and drivers of change; 2) Non-technical summaries of workshop and student project outputs, including guidance for community empowerment in fisheries management and identification of key knowledge gaps; 3) Facilitated dialogue between different stakeholder groups and open channels for future communication; 4) Established structure and mechanisms for on-going community engagement projects (e.g. appointment of appropriate local community heads, lines of communication between local fishermen associations and local government, identification of roles for project partners); 5) Education and dissemination materials; 6) Science engagement day at local school and 7) Access by stakeholders to academic advisors.

Physical project outputs will be made widely available (and translated as necessary) digitally and as hard copy. A project website will summarise the project aims, activities and progress, and provide a hub through which reports can be accessed. Regular updates to the webpage and through social media will be used to maintain interest. Links will be made to partner websites to extend the outreach of these communication materials. On inception, a short press release will be issued outlining the project and its activities, with further press releases throughout the project. In addition, a programme of popular articles in local newspapers as well as interviews with local radio and TV stations will be pursued in Malaysia. Similar opportunities will be sought in the UK</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48503</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P020925/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
