While it has long been recognised that sites require protection, conservation and management, they are increasingly implicated in wider programmes of social and economic development. A significant part of this is tourism-related which is widely perceived as a pathway to development particularly within developing countries where heritage and the wider landscape are important, if often fragile resources. Closely linked to this is the wider cultural and creative sector that animates places and supports tourism. 

The United Nation's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognises the role that the inter-connected sectors of culture, heritage, the creative industries and tourism can play in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. The focus of this Network is specifically on the role that World Heritage sites can play in sustainable development as high profile actors in both cultural heritage and international tourism. In terms of the sites themselves and associated symbolic, 'brand' value of UNESCO inscription, World Heritage sites offer significant development opportunities for ODA countries. However, there are clearly sensitivities around a more instrumental use of World Heritage that has long been immersed in the discourse of protection and preservation rather than as a lever for social, environmental and economic improvement within the context of sustainable development. Furthermore, there remains limited understanding of the ways in which World Heritage can actualise sustainable development through engagement with local communities and the embedded knowledge and creativity they hold. This role of the community is recognised by UNESCO but mechanisms for harnessing this are not well developed. While clearly recognising the over-arching need to protect and maintain World Heritage, there is a need to re-imagine and re-structure the way that it is used; not simply as interesting and attractive places to visit but as highly visible and influential resources that can be used to achieve the SDGs. 

Through a series of workshops, including those held in ODA countries, this project establishes and builds a Network of experienced and new researchers, policy makers and local stakeholders to share research, new ideas and examples of good practice relating to the ways in which World Heritage can be effectively and sensitively mobilised for sustainable development. Each workshop will focus on a World Heritage site and will act as a research activity and an opportunity to debate questions of practice and policy around concepts such as developing and managing sustainable tourism, working with the wider cultural and creative sectors and site management and governance. It will seek to better understand the conditions of working with World Heritage and the barriers to sustainable utilisation of the sites. The Network will recognise the multi/interdisciplinary nature of its objectives and its core partners and will seek to learn from the communities and stakeholders it engages with. In working with UNESCO's World Heritage Centre and specifically the sustainable tourism programme the Network will endeavour to shape policy and strategy and to disseminate its outputs and working methods beyond its immediate partners so as to engage with the other World Heritage sites in ODA countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Cultural heritage and World Heritage in particular, is increasingly recognised as being an important resource, the careful valorisation of which can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs in ODA countries. This re-thinking of World Heritage and new initiatives to implicate it into the wider sustainable development agenda raises important issues of social justice, development, governance, cultural economics, tourism, interpretation and management which have relevance for academics from across several disciplines and importantly for non-academic site/community-based practitioners. This research Network provides academic and non-academic members with new methods and insights that will be of direct relevance to their practice. Through World Heritage site-based workshops the collaborative research process ensures that practitioners have a voice and a role in defining and addressing research questions so as to provide new perspectives on scholarly work in this area. The workshop outputs, particularly in terms of the themed reports, the on-going reporting and information resource of the open access website, case study material and the final Network report from the dissemination conference at UNESCO HQ Paris, are addressed to both academic and non-academic communities.

As referenced in the attached Pathways to Impact document, academics, practitioners, stakeholder organisations and groups are members of the Network and are directly incorporated into the research process through involvement in both the workshops and the conference. The key partners of the Network are active in research and the debates relating to the valorisation of World Heritage and have direct experience of working with and in, World Heritage Sites in ODA countries. An important partner is UNESCO's Sustainable Tourism Programme (STP) at the World Heritage Centre. The STP engages directly with World Heritage Sites in ODA countries and has capacity building within local communities as a foundational element of its work. Through the STP the Network project will be able to reach practitioners and academics and existing examples of good practice in a majority of ODA countries. Capacities for academic research in the UNESCO World Heritage Centre will be enhanced by the project and outputs from the workshops and the on-going debate catalysed through its members will find a genuinely global audience. In the two ODA workshops (China and Peru) beneficiaries will include local, regional and national stakeholders, each gaining new and trans-national perspectives on the mobilisation of World Heritage for sustainable development. In orchestrating the workshops new and innovative partnerships will be demonstrated between World Heritage managers and the wider constituency of the cultural and creative sector, the tourism sector, education and business. 

The final conference event in UNESCO, Paris, will be an important occasion for the Network to disseminate its findings, to discuss the problems and opportunities explored in the workshops, to formulate further research pathways and to shape policy within ODA countries that are seeking to utilise their World Heritage resources for sustainable development. 

The Network will initiate a dialogue between scholars across diverse disciplines, practitioners and policy-makers which shapes future academic and non-academic engagement in this field. Of particular concern will be to engage with and encourage early career researchers and PhD students in cross-disciplinary research on the relationships between World Heritage and sustainable development in the ODA countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47713</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006183/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E531E0AA-923F-4B08-BC17-0B51B22FCA38</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Recreation/Tourism Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>648B790C-8CC1-40BA-B713-BF27B871D211</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
