Building upon the findings of the TLRP Literacies for Learning in Further Education (LfLFE) research project (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lancs.ac.uk/lflfe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>www.lancs.ac.uk/lflfe&lt;/a>, Ivanic et al. 2007)&amp;nbsp; this project seeks to extend that work by focusing on one particular aspect of literacy for learning; literacy for assessment in the further education context.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project is located in and extends theoretically the situated view of literacy practices developed in the New Literacy Studies (NLS). This project builds on NLS to explore literacy practices as assemblages of micro-practices and artefacts, that is, enacted rather than simply situated, drawing selectively upon actor-network theory (Latour 2005). &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will be multi-stage and multi-method and use an ethographic approach. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>It will focus on the assessment practices in two subject areas in one Further Education college. Two courses at different levels will be followed through the use of documentary analysis, observation of classroom assessment practices and indepth interviews and focus focus groups with lecturers and students. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>In summary, this project will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Identify the literacy in assessment practices in further education. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Contribute to our understanding of students' literacy careers&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Contribute to the understanding of literacy practices within educational contexts.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp; Contribute to theory within New Literacy Studies.&lt;br />&lt;/li>

The third seminar in the series was hosted by the Scottish Qualification Authority on the theme of 'Assessment and the Curriculum'. The PI attended the seminar and made contributions to the discussions and workshops from the research carried out for this award.
 This was a one day seminar event as part of a wider seminar series. The speakers included : Professor Paul Black (University of London), Professor Bob Lingard (University of Queensland) and Dr Gill Stewart (Scottish Qualifications Authority). The event provided an opportunity for academic researchers and policy makers to share ideas that will shape the assessment practices as they are developed for the new Curriculum for Excellene in Scotland

Some students from both curriculum areas found certain literacy practices to be a barrier for them when considering studying at higher levels. It was found that some of the more academic type literacy practices did discourage some students from engaging in higher level study that they needed in order to compete in the job market. It was also found that some of the simulated practice orientated literacies were not very useful in terms of preparing the students for the literacy demands of employment in the relevant sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our finding can be put to use by educationalists designing curriculum and assessment practices.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4FC19D8B-8595-472B-A874-180ED6D3C110</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>New professional qualifying programme in Community Learning and Participation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3BE04628-0A28-40D1-B851-5F38439B3FA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main impact has been in relation to the design of a new teaching programme by the PI at her new institution.
