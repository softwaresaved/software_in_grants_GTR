However, scientific research on the underlying biology of extinction risks is developing piecemeal, and has mostly focused on vertebrates. To date, the IUCN Red List provides the most widely used and well-known system for assessing extinction risks (1). Initially, it was not intended to set conservation priorities, but in practice it often feeds directly into this process. Recent research by the PI of this proposal showed that the processes of extinction and speciation are linked in the Cape flora of South Africa - seemingly the most vulnerable species are often the youngest (2). This research revived debates about how best to employ IUCN Red Lists: indeed, young species may appear at high risk of extinction simply because their populations have not yet had time to grow and spread (2, 3). However, it is also possible that some plant species might be doomed to extinction from their very inception. Critically, Savolainen and co-workers found that the most vulnerable plant species are nonetheless marching towards extinction at a more rapid pace, but surprisingly, independently from human impact (2). 
 
Encroachment by invasive alien plants is another major source of threat to ecosystems. Indeed, up to half a million species are classified as 'invasive aliens' worldwide, causing costs of over 1 trillion euros per year (4). So far, it has not been possible to predict whether an introduced species will become invasive, and it is unclear whether certain traits promote invasiveness. Recent research by the PI in a subtropical archipelago (Azores) showed that introduced plant species are likely to become invasive when there are no closely related species in the area (5). Using phylogenetic information, some measures of evolutionary relatedness turned out to a reliable predictor of invasiveness. Also, using analyses at different geographic scales, Savolainen and co-workers argued that enemy release plays an important role in biological invasions in the Azores (5). 
 
Although British plants are by far some of the best-known anywhere in the world in terms of taxonomy, geography and ecology - astoundingly, the causes of their extinction risks as well as threats by 'alien taxa' (currently outnumbering native species in the UK) are understudied. Following methodologies developed by the PI in subtropical areas, and building on preliminary phylogenetic data available at the host, we will fill this knowledge gap - aiming to identify correlates of extinctions and predictors of invasions in the British flora. Undoubtedly comparisons between the UK and the subtropics will also prove pertinent.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Outreach Activities:

Events: 

We will organise a workshop with representatives of our major stakeholders (IUCN, DEFRA, JNCC, learned societies, NERC's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Natural England, etc). This workshop will be held at RBG Kew in Month 13, so that there is scope for our stakeholders to influence the planned analyses for the last five months, maybe suggesting some particularly ones relevant to their remits. We will invite the participants via RBG Kew, which has considerable experience in this sort of cross-sectors meeting. During this workshop, we will present our results and seek feedback, while also organising a science/policy debate under the hospice of the GSPC. A public lecture in the Jodrell Laboratory at RBG Kew by one of us will conclude this day. The lecture will be filmed and available to view/download on our institutional websites and on YouTube. 

At the end of the project, we will organise a public exhibition in the Gardens at RBG Kew - presenting our results to visitors, on large panels mounted outside the Jodrell Laboratory. The exhibition will last two weeks, when we expect about 40,000 people to visit RBG Kew. These panels will also be reused during open days at Imperial College London.

Press and Communication Activities: 

We will write at least two scientific papers, targeting high impact, open access journals such as Nature, Science, PNAS, PLoS Biology. Publications will be publicised by press releases and podcasts from our press offices (Imperial and Kew). We will also have dedicated pages on Savolainen's website, where data, reports, ppt figures, potential teaching material, etc, will be available freely. An executive summary report of our research will also be posted on our website and Nature Preceedings, and available to stakeholders at the end of the project.

A Popular article will be published in Kew Magazine, the quarterly magazine of the RBG Kew. The contribution of top writers and photographers, combined with outstanding design, high production values and editorial quality, has made Kew Magazine a finalist and winner of the Garden Media Guild Awards several times in the past. One article about our research will be written by one of the regular contributors of the magazine, and commissioned by RBG Kew.

Finally, we will present our research with an oral communication at one international conference, such as the European Symposium of Evolutionary Biology (ESEB 2013).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48648</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Botanic Garden of Wales</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with The National Botanic Garden of Wales</gtr:description><gtr:id>55C6E0BB-D8B3-4601-9327-1D78DC085641</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>A collaboration with the National Botanic Garden of Wales has been initiated to complete the UK flora. Dr Natasha De Vere hosted us early in the project - which resulted in a MoU set up between them and our team. They have DNA barcoded the flora of Wales, and it was agreed we will do the rest of the UK focusing on non-native taxa. The collaboration was publicised via a press release on 26 June 2012.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Uncovered - Natural History Museum (September 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3CBDDAD-D81A-40CC-BB7E-B0662712478F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Science Uncovered is a widely-advertised and well-attended public outreach event hosted at the Natural History Museum in London, where scientist engage with the public face-to-face basis to discuss their research and its implications in an informal setting. I represented Imperial College London, accompanied by two PhD students, and discussed my group's work, which included the current grant, under the general theme of ecological responses and alterations to energy flux in food webs due to environmental stressors. At our stall we spoke to several hundred visitors throughout the day.

From these samples we have carried out a combination of CTAB and Qiagen Plant kit based extractions methods. A total of 42 sequences for the rbcL gene have been obtained so far. We also downloaded all sequences from GenBank and cross-checked entries with various taxonomic databases and lists of plants in the UK. We concluded that 246 samples will need to be collected and sequenced in priority; visits to Kew have been also organised to obtain about 50 of these.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0FB4FB8B-CD7D-4337-B28C-7855DF0141D9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has started as initially scheduled.
