Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) has emerged as a complement, valuable and rapid technique for probing protein structure, functional flexibility, conformational variability, allosteric changes, as well as for monitoring and characterising protein interactions with other macromolecules, small metabolites and drugs. Moreover, HDX applications also have focused on monitoring protein stability in response of post-translational modifications and covalent ligand/drug binding as well as protein engineering. Despite the significant progress in HDX method developments, all current HDX techniques are limited by either the system size and complexity or resolution, with which HDX data can be obtained. As a result, the traditional high-resolution (HR) HDX techniques have only restricted (if any) applicability for many challenging biological systems, such as multidomain proteins, transient and multicomponent protein-protein complexes, large intrinsically disordered proteins/regions, and membrane proteins. 

We propose to develop a time- and cost-efficient HDX 3D NMR approach, applicable for the high-resolution characterisation of large challenging proteins. The proposed project will significantly enhance the current HDX capabilities, improving its effectiveness, efficiency and applicability to the biological and biomedical systems, currently inaccessible via the other HR HDX techniques. It will allow the collection and analysis of high resolution HDX data, obtained with the use of physiological protein concentrations (as low as sub-uM) and physiological buffers (without limitations on salt concentration and buffer composition). 

We will performed read-out 3D NMR experiments in aprotic organic solvent DMSO that preserves HDX patterns obtained under physiological conditions, but drastically improves the quality of NMR spectra by unfolding the protein of interest. We will exploit the most recent developments in ultra-resolution fast multidimensional NMR to allow time-optimised, semi-automatic data acquisitions, NMR assignments and analysis of HDX read-out 3D NMR spectra. We will vigorously test and optimise the proposed approach using several model systems, which represent the most common types of challenging protein systems, including multidomain proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins, transient protein complexes, and membrane proteins. 

Next, we will examine the accuracy and applicability of the HDX 3D NMR approach for drug developments, particularly, for monitoring conformational perturbations induced by small molecule binding. As model systems we will use molecular chaperones BIP and Hsp90 that undergo subtle, but functionally important conformational changes upon binding to small molecule inhibitors. 

This project will provide a long-awaited high-resolution method for structural and dynamic characterisation of challenging and complex biological systems in the near-native context. In a long term, it will provide new opportunities for elucidation of molecular mechanisms of action for large, multicomponent biological machines and facilitate future drug developments for such systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) is a unique and rapid technique providing detailed information about structure and conformational flexibility of protein systems in solution and effects of drug binding, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), disease-related mutations and aggregations. Despite a very significant progress during the last decade, all current high-resolution HDX have a number of serious limitations that restrict its applicability for many challenging and complex protein systems. We are seeking finding for the development a new semi-automatic HDX platform that enables structural and dynamic characterisation of large biomedical systems, inaccessible via other structural methods, using physiological conditions and protein concentrations.

Industrial beneficiaries:
We expect to develop long lasting industrial impact through the development a new time- and cost-efficient HDX platform. Our experimental developments and new HDX NMR software will open up a new area of characterisation of challenging biological systems, such as multidomain proteins, multicomponent protein complexes and networks, membrane proteins and long intrinsically disordered regions (i.e., interdomain linkers, unstructured domains, etc.), enabling designing of allosteric drugs and small molecule modulators that specifically target such challenging systems, which currently cannot be exploited. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry would benefit significantly; in the longer term, this approach could be used for 'smart' drug design and would lead to new and improved medicines. For the last decade ACSMB has built strong collaborations with pharmaceutical and biomedical companies, culminating in the establishment of the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical innovation hub within the University with an industrial advisory board that includes 18 industrial partners. We will use the hub to promote our research and establish suitable industrial collaborators if/when appropriate.

Delivering highly skilled people:
The proposed project will train a PDRA in cutting-edge NMR technologies and a range of other biophysical and computational techniques, as well as the handling and analysis of large challenging protein systems. In addition, this approach will significantly raise the PDRA's mathematical and computational skills and will facilitate implementations of these skills to tackle challenging biomedical problems. Altogether, this will prepare the PDRA for a successful future career, whether in academia or industry. At Leeds, we actively promote research-led teaching for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Hence, progress made in the mechanistic characterisation of large multicomponent protein systems would enhance many aspects of the teaching delivered as well as contribute to the students' learning experience. In terms of our own research, once this HDX 3D NMR approach has been developed, we intend to exploit it to study large protein systems of biological and medical interest. Thus, we anticipate opportunities to apply for further grant funding from research councils and charities.

Wider impacts for the general public:
The development of the proposed experimental approach will allow characterization of challenging biological/biomedical systems, including those have been identified as targets for pharmaceutical intervention in prevalent diseases. Thus, funding of this project will potentially lead to improved drug developments, which will improve the quality of life.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100792</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P012701/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3493671D-A4CF-4197-90A7-3CCFBE1C0627</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools for the biosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
