It explored the academic debate on power and involved discussions with communities about power. At a time when the state has proposed to 'disengage' from society and hand 'power' to communities, the paper reviewed the nature of power in communities. The academic debate has involved a paradigm shift in understanding power, from power over to power to. However, power over or dominating power has remained the conventional form of power in practice. The scoping paper argued that there was still a need to hang onto such an understanding of power for that reason, but that today we can park that idea and focus on a much wider range of issues around power. The argument for instance, that we have to view power as emanating from an agent and in terms of a dichotomy between the 'powerful' and 'powerless' has been questioned. We cannot only see power as a negative force upon us, but as something which is part of our social world and which forms our subjectivity and structures our dispositions in ways that we reconfirm through life but can also 'unconfirm'. The Scoping Review looked at how the idea of empowerment and tools for analysing power have been developed to build a critical consciousness around power for those who feel 'powerless'. However, it argued that there was a need to go beyond 'empowerment' to transform power itself. In talking to a range of groups in four socially varied communities across the north of England, it became clear that amongst those seeking change at the grass roots, most understood power in non dominating forms, as about cooperation, listening, sharing and enabling others. Non dominating forms of power, it was argued, offered the best potential for building participation and connecting communities. However, they are not the most effective for acting on power. Those who use them reject the way power is conventionally exercised and end up acting on the margins and giving up expectations of wider impacts. The Scoping Review asked, therefore, how can non dominating forms of power become effective in changing power and power structures without reproducing dominating power?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this scoping review have been taken forward into the co-construction of a Community University with funding from the ESRC and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The participants in the'Power Talks' came together to design the bid for the Community University on Power and Participation. The bid was successful, but some of those involved in the 'Power Talks' were no longer able to participate by the time the Community University got underway, due to illness and personal factors. There were nevertheless a core group, and it is this core group that formed part of the Community University Council, enabling local activists to co-run the Community University and strengthening strong links between academics and activists aiming to bring about change in housing and community relations in Bradford District, for example. Following year long Community University, some participants have continued the process of co production and co reflection of issues around power and participation in their localities through the Thinkspace of the Programme for a Peaceful City, University of Bradford. We therefore have a story of continuity and development from the original Scoping Review, which has centred on ongoing reflection between academics and community activists around power and 'non dominating power' and how the latter might enhance effectiveness for change. The International Centre for Participation Studies which is the institutional framework within Bradford Peace Studies for this process along with the Programme for a Peaceful City, was also part of a 'learning adviser' team to the government's Community Organising Programme. Learning from the Scoping Review and the Community University has fed into that Programme through this role. In addition, a collaboration was set up with the Civic Driven Change group of the Institute of Social Studies in the Hague, which has enabled the findings from the Scoping Review to feed into a global debate about change and power. An Academic article was published in Development and Change 2013, which explored the idea of 'Power and the Activist: from the Neighbourhood to the Square'. Further academic development was channelled through a workshop of the Journal of Power in Galway Ireland, in 2013.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9C14D47B-5776-461E-A989-C0FDCC5C9C28</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J50109X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
