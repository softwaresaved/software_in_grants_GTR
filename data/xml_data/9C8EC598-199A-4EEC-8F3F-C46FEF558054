They will also be of significant interest to the healthcare sector and the following industrial sectors: ICT, robotics, pharmaceuticals, medical and scientific instrumentation, bioengineering. Aspects of the work will also be of interest to the general public. The work has the potential to: revolutionize the resolution and sensitivity of imaging of electrical activity in cultured neurons, and hence the whole field of neuroscience; point the way to radical new diagnostic tools and interventions for use in next generation healthcare; develop new ways of building much more accurate computational models of neurons that could be powerful tools in fundamental science and in applications such as drug screening; develop powerful new methods in autonomous mobile robotics based on new models and understandings of biological sensing, learning and memory; open up paths for new adaptive methods in computing; and provide radical new tools to ecologists to help e.g. illuminate questions about differences in behaviours between healthy and sick bees and how changes to the environment affect their navigational abilities. Early results will be disseminated via standard academic routes: high quality journal and conference papers and presentations. The direct involvement of medical practitioners and ecologists will ensure early engagement with these potential end users. Work will also be disseminated via our involvement in many special interest groups and knowledge transfer networks. Our many industrial contacts will be kept abreast of developments via an annual CCNR open day. The CCNR and CPEQT websites will provide a platform for easy general access to results of the feasibility studies. The research will also feed into the CCNR's active programme of public engagement activities. Aspects of the project will be suitable for wider popular dissemination across the spectrum of media, this will be achieved through the University's press office. Commercialisation possibilities will be discussed with Sussex IP and relevant industrial contacts and collaborators towards the end of the account.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199399</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>492970</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EU ICT FET FP7</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>308943</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6853CC0C-5580-4117-96B9-3A16C2D25292</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>102329</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC research grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/I031758/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>DFD104D6-4FC0-4D89-82BD-28C0A3345C71</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The development of tools and methods to shed light on mechanisms underlying insect navigation, including the
development of navigation algorithms using minimal resources. New methods and tools were applied to aquiring data on
the sensory information used by insects during navigation. This led to the developemnt of successful navigation algorithms
using very minimal sensory and computational resources which were demonstrated on a robot.

The exploration of physical models of replicating molecules as a new tool for understanding evolutionary processes was introduced. By
building a real physical model of template replication we were able to suggest new possible answers to the vexing question

The investigation of the applicability to robotics of new models of biological sensing and associative memory led to a

competition for neural resources) based on recent findings in mammalian (hippocampal) neurobiology. This efficacy of this
system in navigation was demonstrated and has led to further developments in that area. This theme also involved a study to assess the potential of using novel models of
insect olfaction mechanisms to develop much faster and more accurate chemical discrimination than is currently possible,
paving the way for practical olfactory robot applications. The feasibility of using metal oxide 'smell' sensors was tested on a
gantry robot by mapping out their sensitivity in space and time. It was discovered that currently commercially available
sensors react too slowly to make them useful in most practical applications. The study allowed us to develop requirements
for an 'ideal' sensor for this application which has led to new research to develop more practical approaches.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F0D65BAB-5305-41E4-A66D-3AC423BCF9C0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research foci of this feasibility account was at the interfaces between biology, in particular neuroscience, and

systems and phenomena, and the transfer of these understanding to bio-inspired technology, and to the development of
new kinds of diagnostic tools for next-generation healthcare. Major themes undertaken were:
The investigation of new tools and techniques for measuring, interpreting and modelling electrical activity in neuronal
networks. A novel form of electric potential sensors were built and tested on cultured biological neuronal networks. The
feasibility of using near-infrared optical imaging (NIR) to detect localized neuronal activity in cultures of Lymnaea neurons
mounted on a multi-electrode array was also investigated after building a specilaised NIR rig. In both cases promising initial
results have been achieved. The third part of this theme involved acquiring preliminary data on a radical new proposed
indirect measurement technology to build accurate neuron models by comparing the model with the relevant biological
neuron in real time (the dynamic observer technique) . The core concept was to combine online parameter estimation
(&amp;quot;fitting&amp;quot;) with dynamic clamp technology (the coupling of computer models to living neurons). Very prominsing initial results
have been achieved with the method.
The investigation of the applicability of dynamical systems analyses to early diagnosis of cerebral palsy.
This study tested the feasibility of this idea by attempting to produce a dynamical systems analysis of motor activity in
developing infants. After recording the movement and muscle activity from typically developing (healthy) infants aged 2-4
months, dynamical system analysis was used for the identification and formalisation of intra- and inter-limb synergies and
rotational elements; and the identification of control parameters and juncture points by bifurcation analysis. This study has
provided a proof of principle for the approach which will be further developed in future work.
The investigation of the applicability to robotics of new models of biological sensing and associative memory. In this study a
prototype (recurrent, spiking) neural network model was developed incorporating a novel form of plasticity (involving local
competition for neural resources) based on recent findings in mammalian (hippocampal) neurobiology. This efficacy of this
