In this FLexible Interchange Programme (FLIP) project Professor Iain Donnison seeks to increase his knowledge of innovation management and innovation leadership at a world leading Centre for Innovation: the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan. The FLIP project will be to study beyond the development of new technologies to tackle problems and will focus on the innovative mechanisms to bring products to market and therefore span the notorious &amp;quot;valley of death&amp;quot; the barrier which exists between University science and its translated into successful business opportunities. There will also be wider benefits for his home Institution, Aberystwyth University and the wider UK bioscience community. His career to date has involved positions in academia and in the private sector and the FLIP project brings this expertise together at a time when Innovation is becoming more recognized as something that the UK needs to do more of and better. Science and technology are recognized as being important in playing a role in the stimulation of economic growth and job creation. New Innovation Campuses including at Aberystywth University are exploring mechanisms by which the UK can achieve greater economic benefits from its world leading bioscience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Outputs of the FLIP project will be: 
1) Learning about how innovation is achieved in ITRI, Taiwan.
2) Manuscripts written on: 1) lessons learnt during innovation activities over the last five years including as Director of the BEACON Biorefining Centre; and 2) the role of plant phenomics in innovation. 
In addition after the project I will seek to:
3) Apply knowledge learnt to the delivery of current and future projects that I lead or are involved with.
4) Impart knowledge to others in Aberystwyth University and the wider UK bioscience community on my return and over the coming years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22642</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Wales Science Cafe: The Welsh Science Wishlist</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9ECD1635-97A4-4ADB-AAD5-9996C18623AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An interview for BBC Radio Wales Science Cafe.

Iain Donnison gave the interview on wishes for the future environmental policy.

Science votes
The Welsh Government believes that science in Wales is world class. And on this programme we frequently trumpet the pioneering research at our universities. But is enough being done to build a strong and successful scientific community? Many in Wales are concerned that we are failing on science education and in preparing for the digital future. In this special edition of Science Caf&amp;eacute; scientists reveal, for the policy makers, their wish lists. And ahead of next month's elections, the political parties outline their scientific priorities.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0776lxj</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings are still maturing and impact being created including through feeding into Innovation and Enterprise Campus's being established at Aberystwyth and elsewhere in the UK. Findings include greater understanding of the International Innovation ecosystem and increasing entrepreneurship in graduates to encourage greater numbers of start ups as well as working in industry, and also greater engagement between companies, HEIs/ Institutes and government. This is becoming more relevant with the development of industrial strategies across the UK. So far I have used my learning to engage with local, regional and national governments either directly or through consultation (e.g. the Welsh Science Adviser on future science strategy in Wales and BEIS on the Bioeconomy consultation) in seeking to achieve greater connection between academia and regional industrial strategy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A0AD22F2-4F43-44A0-806C-8A4551DAC184</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Construction,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research was to understand the international innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem and routes to translation of research.

The CBD entered into force on 29 December 1993 following the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio &amp;quot;Earth Summit&amp;quot;). The Convention was inspired by the world community's growing commitment to sustainable development and represented a dramatic step toward the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. 

New crop breeding programmes are dependent on the collection and characterisation of diverse genetic resources. Importantly since the domestication of the staple crops, legally binding contracts including the CBD have been put in place to ensure that where genetic resources are collected from one country and commercially exploited elsewhere, the benefits of the exploitation are shared with the donor country. 

IBERS researchers pioneered the making of new Miscanthus collections and the negotiation of the necessary agreements in the absence of clear national legislation for the implementation of the access and benefit sharing arrangements under the CBD and ahead of the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing in 2011. IBERS scientists worked closely with Defra and partners in Asia to implement the CBD and access and benefit sharing Protocols through organising joint workshops, collaborative research and legal negotiations. For example an international Workshop on Green Chemistry and Biomass Energy which was jointly funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan and the BBSRC, was held at the National Cheng Kung University on 3 November. Aberystwyth University and National Cheng Kung University formally signed a memorandum of understanding at the workshop, the signing of which was presided over by the vice chancellor of the Cheng Kung University and the CEO of BBSRC. 

In May 2012, Taiwan was the first Asian country to sign a full access and benefit sharing agreement under the CBD framework with the UK, and this was followed by successful negotiations with South Korea with an agreement to comply with CBD in November 2011, negotiations for access and benefits sharing up to July 2013 and an official signing of access and benefits sharing in October 2013. On both occasions the UK was represented by BEAA in the negotiation. This has created one of the first examples for implementing Nagoya protocols in the UK and our partnering countries. Not only have IBERS scientists implemented two international agreements but their experience and knowledge of setting up bi- lateral access and benefit sharing agreements under the CBD framework is now also being used as a proven example for others to follow, helping to support government's approach to legislation in this area. This includes the UK government's approach to the proposed &amp;quot;Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (Nagoya Protocol): Union implementation and ratification&amp;quot;, an EU-wide legislation to be submitted to the European Parliament which was voted on in committee on 4 July 2013. The main beneficiaries of this policy impact are therefore the UK government's agriculture policy legislation body (Defra), donor countries in Asia, commerce (only compliant germplasm can be commercially exploited in signatory countries) and the global society on the conservation of natural resources.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4BF5E3E2-1D22-4061-8D7F-E47610F35249"><gtr:id>4BF5E3E2-1D22-4061-8D7F-E47610F35249</gtr:id><gtr:title>Characterisation of Nature-Based Solutions for the Built Environment</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sustainability</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/04d0f9f7cf89e359b71a037f2eb2f0b7"><gtr:id>04d0f9f7cf89e359b71a037f2eb2f0b7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xing Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B06FE72D-3C5D-4449-9500-372DB7BD7473"><gtr:id>B06FE72D-3C5D-4449-9500-372DB7BD7473</gtr:id><gtr:title>Diversification and use of bioenergy to maintain future grasslands.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food and energy security</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3f3aa178934be91ca85549ef2e326846"><gtr:id>3f3aa178934be91ca85549ef2e326846</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Donnison IS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2048-3694</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M017486/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>68D4AB6A-88C3-4368-8A94-2DADEEF21FF5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioenergy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D6F08770-CB96-423D-89E7-3F64DE17997E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Innovation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
