- whether by primary or secondary legislation and by Scottish, Welsh or UK Institutions - and the extent of substantive

differences in the resulting law across Great Britain. (Obj. 1-3) It then examined the reasons for the choices that had been

made.

The legislative review found that there is a high volume of UK/GB regulations implementing EC environmental Directives

for Scotland (12 +1 mixed/32) and Wales (27/32), which can be justified under the devolution settlement. There are 19

instances where Scotland produced separate legislation to transpose EC environmental rules and five occasions where

Wales acted separately. The study found that the decision to transpose separately is distinct from the decision to

transpose identically and the majority of the laws transposing EC measures are identical across the UK. Legislation

produced by the UK institutions contains no regional variation hence any Scottish or Welsh solutions must emanate from

the devolved institutions themselves. Only one of the five Welsh regulations contains provisions substantively different

from their English counterparts, whereas a third of the separate Scottish legislation does so. &amp;quot;Substantive&amp;quot; differences go

beyond inconsequential phrasing or those necessary due to legal or institutional differences between jurisdictions.

Transposing legislation in Scotland (primary or secondary) and Wales also receives more detailed scrutiny than where

transposition is by regulations passed at Westminster.

Semi-structured interviews with key personnel in the relevant administrations and agencies were used to explore the

reasons for the pattern that we identified and to trace changes in the behaviour as the devolution settlement has matured

(New Obj. 5). The interviews explored the relationships and processes involved in deciding who legislates, how and by

whom these decisions are made, the factors and presumptions influencing them and their consequences (Obj.1-4).

The study revealed that while the devolution settlements set presumptions as to who should legislate the position is not

rigid. Compared to Wales, Scotland is clearly more willing to legislate both separately and differently. This is predictable

as Scotland has more legislative power to do so, is better resourced, has a separate legal system and regulator from

England and is more used to acting separately. Most of the mechanisms for determining the implementation process are

informal and have evolved incrementally over the transition period, relying on co-operation, existing relationships and the

mutual respect that comes from the unified civil service. As a result, the process for determining which administration

should legislate and the content of that legislation lacks transparency and accountability.

The study concludes that while the informal and co-operative approach has to date worked this is unlikely to continue. Coordination

and co-operation will inevitably become more difficult over time. Already, even the slightest differences in

legislation are having cumulative and knock on effects and the laws in England, Wales and Scotland are incrementally

drifting apart. Moreover, the devolved administrations are more confident about legislating separately. London and the

devolved administrations no longer share the same political colour so informal processes are more difficult and the

likelihood of dispute higher. The research recommends that the Memorandum of Understanding and Concordats need to

be revisited and that more transparent and formal processes for consultation, representation and dispute resolution are

either resurrected or introduced both at UK level and within the devolved administrations.

The research has led to 4 conference papers, at least 3 academic articles, two professional articles and contributions to

two major inquiries on governance in Scotland.

Importance - To date very little research has provided any quantitative analysis of outcomes related to devolution. This

research provides the missing quantitative analysis of actual legislative outcomes needed to measure the impact of

devolution on the implementation of EC environmental law. More specifically, its analysis of this legislation reveals the

extent of the differences in the implementing legislation across GB and the rationales behind these differences. The

empirical work reveals how decisions about implementation such as who should legislate, legislative form and content are

actually made and the nature of the relationships between and among the central and devolved institutions both in GB

and in Brussels. The research also provides evidence into how the priorities and pressures on the devolved and central

administrations impact on their approach to the implementation of EC environmental law. These pressures and priorities

include political agendas, resource constraints such as staffing, expertise and time, the legislative timetable, language

obligations, differing legal approaches to statutory interpretation, the better regulation agenda including gold plating, the

impact of regulations on regulators, businesses and trade as well as local or regional concerns.

Environmental Law - The research provides valuable evidence into how EC environmental obligations are transposed in

to UK domestic law. By examining the differences in both form and substance, it has revealed the extent of divergence

between the environmental laws for Scotland, England and Wales and the likelihood of further divergence in GB post

devolution.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In December 2007, the team produced written evidence for the European and External Relations Committee of the

Scottish Parliament in relation to its inquiry into the transposition of EU law in Scotland. Ms Ross also met with the Clerk

of that Committee in December 2007, and the findings from the legislative review of the project are widely cited in the

Committee's report. (see European and External Relations Committee, Report on an inquiry into the transposition of EU

directives 1st Report, 2008 (Session 3), SP Paper 89).

In April 2008, the Commission on Scottish Devolution (the Calman Commission) established by the Scottish Parliament

with the support of the UK Parliament, began its review of the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998. The Commission is to

recommend changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to better serve

the people of Scotland. In October 2008, Ms. Ross and Prof. Reid participated in a consultation workshop hosted by the

Commission. We were each in separate roundtable discussions. During the day we found ourselves using the findings to

support anecdotal evidence from other participants. Following the event, the Clerk of the Commission requested copies

of the project's findings.

EUR-LEX is the official EU Law portal, providing direct free access to European Union law including the Official Journals,

treaties, legislation in force, proposed legislation, cases, parliamentary questions etc. EUR-LEX was in the process of

developing their advanced search facility during the summer and autumn of 2006. The search facility did not do what we

needed it to do. Ms Nash worked very closely with the people at EUR-LEX who agreed that this was a gap and we

assisted in testing the advanced search engine as it was developed. We now find the end product to be very useful and

we believe that our active engagement assisted in the development process.

The United Kingdom Environmental Law Association has invited the team to produce a short article for lawyers and other

professionals in its electronic journal e-law. A similar paper was produced in the Scots Law Times for a more generalist

audience of the Scottish legal profession.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>136D882F-89F4-41EA-873A-0B455DDF3DC1</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C37458B0-CA65-4B6C-B62B-329874A4960E"><gtr:id>C37458B0-CA65-4B6C-B62B-329874A4960E</gtr:id><gtr:title>European Union Environmental Law - who legislates for whom in a devolved Great Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Public Law</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6d3d7d2e789d2bbca5f15d30e55f4d2d"><gtr:id>6d3d7d2e789d2bbca5f15d30e55f4d2d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ross A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/04F9A37B-DFF0-4841-963D-65906203D604"><gtr:id>04F9A37B-DFF0-4841-963D-65906203D604</gtr:id><gtr:title>Multi-level governance - a study of the implementation of environmental law in post-devolution Scotland</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental Law and Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1d30ae7363ea35c761f534fe3b946ba0"><gtr:id>1d30ae7363ea35c761f534fe3b946ba0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nash, H.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C5655A41-4E0C-46DB-BA20-8BCB722CDD5E"><gtr:id>C5655A41-4E0C-46DB-BA20-8BCB722CDD5E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Producing a real difference?
