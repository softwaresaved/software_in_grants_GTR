Here, countless thousands of pieces of information about our own bodies and the world around us are integrated and processed to generate perceptions and memories and to initiate appropriate responses. These pieces of information arrive from all over the nervous system as electrical signals. These electrical signals are transferred from one nerve cell, or neurone, to another via tiny chemical signals that in turn generate electrical and chemical events in each follower neurone. The receiving neurones are often very complex, in their shapes and in their electrical and chemical properties. Each one is made up of many different compartments into which information can be channelled. The properties of these different compartments, the way that events in them interact with events in other compartments and how they work together to transform the many different pieces of information that constantly bombard each neurone, into the output of that cell, is the subject of this project. We focus particularly on properties that are affected in neurological diseases such as the several different types of epilepsy, in some cases as the possible cause, in others as the brain?s response to another change or insult.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Evidence for specificity in the properties of synaptic connections is growing, though few studies have examined this issue directly in the smaller dendritic branches of pyramidal cells. Fewer still have studied how the properties of postsynaptic dendritic compartments shape individual synaptic inputs and their summation with events from neighbouring synapses. Many different mechanisms contribute to dendritic properties; mechanisms that may be differentially expressed in different pyramidal cells, different dendrites and dendritic compartments. 



We will test the hypothesis that each class of synaptic input to a given class of postsynaptic cell is distributed over a highly specific region of dendritic space that is homogeneous in its active and passive properties, involves only certain types of dendrites and is at a given electrotonic distance from the soma.



This project will compare the properties of two families of neocortical pyramidal cell dendrites, the apical oblique and the basal dendrites of layer 3 pyramidal cells and how their properties shape the synaptic inputs that impinge upon them. Inputs from layer 4 spiny cells selectively innervate the basal dendrites of layer 3 pyramids, while layer 3 inputs also innervate apical obliques. Calcium transients in the dendrite and voltage responses at the soma produced by the release of caged-glutamate onto different dendritic compartments will be recorded. These will be compared with responses to the glutamate released by the synaptic boutons of a single identified presynaptic neurone in paired recording experiments; the postsynaptic dendritic compartment(s) involved being identified by the close apposition of fluorescently labelled axon and dendrite and co-localised calcium signals. How voltage-gated K+ and cation-selective (HCN) ion channels modify glutamatergic inputs to different dendritic compartments will be explored with ion channel blockers and by comparison of wild type mice with mice lacking HCN or Kv4 channels. These data and 3D reconstructions of the layer 3 neurones will tune a detailed compartmental layer 3 pyramidal cell model and predictions eg. about summation tested experimentally.

 

How both pre- and post-synaptic GABAergic inhibition in these same dendritic compartments interacts with excitatory inputs will also be directly assessed. In one block of paired recording experiments, the effect of uncaging GABA at different positions relative to a synapse(s) from a single presynaptic excitatory cell will be studied. In the other, responses to glutamate uncaged at different positions along a dendrite will be challenged with the input from a single inhibitory interneurone innervating the same dendritic branch.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1497770</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lay abstracts are on the School's website</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8728F8D3-0E00-4353-95D8-A11133E2A0BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Available to prospective undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as the general public.

A minority resembled those in CA1, with fast spiking behaviour, vertically oriented dendrites and axons confined to SP of the region of origin. In contrast, the majority of PV-immunopositive CA2 basket cells had long, horizontally oriented, sparsely spiny dendrites extending into all CA subfields in stratum oriens, adapting firing patterns and a pronounced &amp;quot;sag&amp;quot; in voltage responses to hyperpolarising current injection. Broad CA2 basket cells innervated all three CA-subfields and could thus provide CA1 and CA2 with feed-forward and CA3 with feed-back inhibition.

Mercer, Botcher et al : This study revealed a subclass of dendrite-preferring interneurones in CA2 that had not been previously described in any CA regions, SP-SR interneurones. The dendritic trees of these cells had a similar pattern to those of CA1 and CA2 bistratified cells and Ivy cells in CA1. SP-SR interneurones, however, had a more complex dendritic tree. These cells also had horizontal dendrites that extended into the CA1 and CA3 regions resembling those of CA2 broad basket and bistratified cells. The major difference between these interneurones and previously described classes, was the region-specificity of their axonal arbours and their unique electrophysiological features. 

Botcher et al : This study describes the distributions of interneurones expressing widely used markers in the CA2 region and compares these distributions with those in CA1 and CA3. The CA2 region contains interneurones that express, from the most abundant to the least abundant, Reelin, NPY, SOM, CR, CB, CCK, PV and VIP and their distribution in CA2 is layer-specific. Most distributions were similar to those in CA1 and CA3. However, GAD-positive cells were most likely to be PV-, reelin-, SOM-, CB- and VIP-immunopositive interneurones in Stratum Pyramidale in CA2 than in other areas. Stratum Radiatum of CA2 had a higher density of reelin- and NPY-positive cells than SR in CA1 and/or CA3, but fewer NPY- and CR-immunopositive cells were found in Stratum Lacunosum Moleculare in CA2 than in CA1. Interestingly, analysis revealed that the two classes of interneurones that are most likely to be involved in neurological diseases, PV- and Reelin- immunopositive cells, are more abundant in this region than in CA1 and CA3.

Mercer (review) : An overview of the known properties of electrical synapses between pyramidal cells was given, focusing on a study in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.</gtr:description><gtr:id>84885C32-F400-4A82-8CEF-5806AA6D9B2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Recognition of the distinctive properties of the CA2 region of the hippocampus and of the neuronal classes it contains has been slow to emerge. Indeed, only a few years ago, there was uncertainty and much debate, as to whether the rodent hippocampus had a CA2 region. Interest in this region has been growing in recent years with evidence that it has distinct profiles of change in a range of diseases and that it receives inputs that other CA regions do not receive. These studies have added novel findings and added significantly to this growth of interest in this important region.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Selective targeting of synapses to specific dendritic locations and their modulation by voltage-gated channels - progress in parallel projects</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Setting up and development of a multi-photon microscope in parallel with electrophysiological recording.

We have worked closely with the engineers from the companies who supplied the equipment (multi-photon microscope, lasers, electrophysiological equipment) to optimise performance and significant progress has been made. 

Improving stability and reproducibility has required extensive testing and modification of the system, both of hardware and software. Novel protocols for diagnosis of the sources of image- and uncaging-drift have been developed and the equipment and software modified significantly to minimise drift arising from several different components. We are awaiting the most recent technical improvement, once Prairie has tested it 'in house'.

The project has required development of a range of protocol components including:
- Single, dual and paired whole-cell recordings
- Cell-loading with fluorescent dyes and calcium indicators of different colours e.g. Alexa594 (10-100 uM), Alexa 488 (100 uM), OGB-1 (100 uM) and biocytin (0.4%)
- Two-photon imaging of postsynaptic dendritic spines
- Post-hoc recovery of biocytin-filled neurones and their 3D reconstruction in Neurolucida - followed by... 
- Statistical comparison of morphological parameters (Matlab) across reconstructed cells
- Uncaging of caged compounds with sub-micron accuracy, and with stability over multiple trials.
- Testing different caged compounds.
- Electrophysiological characterization of recorded cells (for data correlation and future modelling) and ....
- Development of semi-automated analysis procedures (IgorPro and Neuromatic) and ...
- Statistical comparison of 51 electrophysiological parameters in anatomically reconstructed cells (Matlab)

Ongoing model development :
- Importation of detailed 3D reconstructed cells into simulation software - NEURON
- Exploration of steady-state and PSP-like signal attenuation across the dendritic tree in a passive model (NEURON)
- Adjustment of modelled conductance kinetics and densities in a multi-compartmental model to match experimental data

In the last 12 months, the contributions made by different K+ channels to the strength and shape of synaptic inputs onto single, or multiple spine synaptic sites have been studied, with a focus on IA. Modelling studies are exploring the relative contributions of the nature of the conductances and the changes to passive properties of the neurones, when channel blockers are applied.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A2A4D52-2DCE-46B5-871F-1CF301228A84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Some of our 'test to extinction' protocols for assessing the performance of their systems have been adopted by Prairie as a gold standard for new systems and will be incorporated in packages supplied to new users in the future.

Entry in November 2014 - The PI's repeated bouts of ill health throughout the project left the project without committed leadership for several periods of months at a time. The co-PIs were too involved in other projects to be able to assume this role. [One attended only one group meeting and provided some advice on the set-up early on. The other was enthusiastically involved in the original set-up and interactions with Prairie's engineers and the postdocs, but later become too involved with other things, to be able to give critical, intellectual guidance when the PI was not available.] 

The project went severely off-track during these phases and considerable time was lost in experiments based on copying the work of other groups, groups that had not yet recognised the ambiguity of the results they were obtaining. During intervening phases, in which the project was pulled back on-track, some quite elegant data were obtained. These demonstrate that the response to activation of multiple synapses within a discrete region of a single dendrite varies strikingly with the location of that region; proximal, intermediate and distal regions behaving quite differently, indicative of the recruitment of different combinations of voltage-gated ion channels in different parts of the dendrite. These different types of responses were, moreover, differentially influenced by potassium channel- and receptor-pharmacology. The data are novel and provide a more elegant description of the functions of several different active conductances in pyramidal cell dendrites than has been published before. 
Unfortunately, enthusiasm for analyzing these data properly is lacking and despite repeated requests, the data have not been made available to the PI. It seems at this point likely, either that the results of these studies will remain unpublished, or that if they are published, the way in which the data are presented will not do justice to the results obtained. 
This is an extremely disappointing outcome, partly the result of a periodically absent PI and partly due to the inexperience of the postdocs involved, who could perform the experiments and first step analysis well, but who have not been able interpret the data they obtained fully, or correct mistakes, nor could they take either the experiments, or the analysis to the next level without considerable hands-on supervision. Attempts are being made to redeem the situation, using money from another source for one of these postdocs, but to predict that this will result in substantial publications would be optimistic.
The PI [who retired in January 2014, but stays in contact with the current phase of the project] deeply regrets this waste of time and resources that has resulted in such a very disappointing end to a long and fruitful relationship between her lab and the MRC.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Selective targeting of synapses to specific dendritic locations and their modulation by voltage-gated channels - progress in first 28 months</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G1000629</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
