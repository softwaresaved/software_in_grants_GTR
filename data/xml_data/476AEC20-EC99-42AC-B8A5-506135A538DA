Nuclear energy also remains a strategic priority for South Korea with capacity planned to be increased by 59% by 2022. New approaches need to be developed to manage high level (HLW), intermediate level (ILW) and low level waste (LLW) in a sustainable way, as well as methods for dealing with unresolved legacy issues. 
This project combines the talents and capabilities within South Korea and the UK to develop solids phase materials that actively target and extract radioactive metals from nuclear wastes. This material is capable of concentrating radioactive metal ions from large volumes of waste in which the problematic radioactive metal ion may be present in small quantities. As an example, rather than sending LLW straight to the Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) in Cumbria, these solid phase materials can be utilised as a method of waste treatment removing the radioactivity of the LLW so it can be safely disposed of in a landfill. This approach will extend the operational life of the LLWR, where space is limited.

Solid phase extractants like these can be developed to selectively target and scavenge specific radioactive metals ions. This work will look at making new solid phase materials to target and remove specific radioactive metal ions, such a cobalt and strontium. This will be done by changing the groups that bind the metal ions on the surface of the silica solid phase.
Work will be carried out to determine how these solid phases, which are silica based, once loaded with radioactive metals can be directly converted into a glass or hybrid glass/ceramic, glass/polymer waste form. Experiments will then determine how this waste form, once made, performs in its ability to safely contain the radioactive material.

The solid phase extractants, once developed, have the ability to be applied to a number of different decommissioning and remediation issues, such as cleaning up legacy cooling pond sludges or decontamination of soil and ground water.

The results from this work will extend the applicability of selective extractants and their use into other areas, while at the same time broadening and cementing collaboration ties between South Korea and the UK in the development of decommissioning technology for future nuclear strategy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Completion of the SINNER research program will create a body of knowledge on the selective extraction of problematic radionuclides from waste streams. This work can be directly applied to decommissioning and remediation strategies both in the UK, South Korea and world-wide. It will also produce a set of new researchers whose skills will be vital to the continuing development of nuclear strategy in the coming decades. It is vital that the knowledge and skills created be supported, nurtured and maintained after the program has finished. It is also an obligation of this program to disseminate the results of our research to as wide an audience as possible; not only to peers, but to non-technical parties who take an interest in the nuclear field. Therefore our pathway to impact will focus on two routes: A) Academic impact, and B) Outreach and engagement.

The overriding priority of the program members will be to publish results in high impact open access journals. In addition; we will encourage our young researchers to present work at relevant meetings/workshops. We also propose to develop a website which will serve as a primary communication service for the UK and Korean groups participating in the project (vide infra). A priority of this program will be the establishment of an effective network within the UK and internationally with South Korea. 2 way knowledge exchange between Korea and the UK is vital to the cross fertilization of ideas and methods and is crucial to the development of this work through the initial TRL levels. Appointment of an advisory board will ensure that the research is closely aligned and informed by industrial needs. The development of a virtual centre of excellence focused on the development of separation techniques for the treatment of nuclear waste will allow researchers to engage multiple industries and research institutes including those outside of the nuclear industry interested in, for example, lanthanide recovery and separation.

Our outreach and engagement is driven to benefit the three main communities outside of academia, namely Industry, the Government and the Public. This will be achieved through a number of means;
Annual Seminars - where we present our research to an open audience 
Themed Workshop - to disseminate knowledge on specific issues to industry and academic.
Website - providing a repository a repository and showcase for the outcomes of our research. Developed in multiple languages to disseminate our work to a global audience. The aim of the web-site;
Inform and update the researchers involved in the program
provide key findings to industry
Inform the advisory boards what the impact of the work will have on the nuclear roadmap
Development of material for incorporation into teaching (KS3-4, UG &amp;amp; PG levels)
Have a political impact, both in the UK and Korea and internationally
Training and Development - mentoring and developing our researchers in the skills and competencies that are required for continuing development of nuclear strategy in a world-wide market.
Public Engagement -participate in third party public engagement opportunities, including public lectures, debating forums, Science Week and getting actively involved with University based Public Engagement &amp;amp; Impact Teams.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>315475</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Chungnam National University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Organic and Optoelectronic Materials Laboratory</gtr:department><gtr:description>Chungnam National University</gtr:description><gtr:id>6C72E1C2-81D9-435B-8544-72A0FA122FCD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop 18th-19th February 2016 held in Sheffield.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Currently have 2 visiting PDRAs from South Korea to see how we work in ion exchange.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sample materials, sharing of information and inclusion in presentations and papers produced from the collaboration.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop in South Korea art Chungnam National University</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B262B77-C865-48CA-A3B8-C72CD850D5A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Delegates from the UK side of the research program (Sheffield, Liverpool, and Reading) gave presentations on their research.

This is predominantly down to the amount of extracting group placed on the solid support. The silica based extractants can load metals 2 to 3 times faster.
It was possible to produce a solid waste form by a pelletisation process and heating above 1000 C. The material produced at lower temperatures of 800C and 900C did not prevent the metals from reacting with water.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are currently adapting the work to produce a funding proposal for either South Korea Phase 2, or responsive mode including Sellafield as industrial partners.
