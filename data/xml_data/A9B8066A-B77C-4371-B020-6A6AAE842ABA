What is startling is the recent increase in overweight and obesity prevalence in almost every country in the world, including low and middle income countries. As obesity carries with it a wide range of health problems, it has also an adverse economic impact, imposing a cost not only on affected individuals and their families, but also on society as a whole. The challenge facing governments and health authorities is to deliver a sustainable response to overweight and the obesity 'pandemic' by putting in place effective multisectoral strategies dealing with the many determinants of obesity.

As the regulation of food marketing is seen as a cornerstone of effective obesity prevention strategies, the 193 Member States gathered at the Sixty-third World Health Assembly in 2010 unanimously endorsed a set of Recommendations intended to guide efforts by Member States in designing new and/or strengthening existing policies on food marketing to children (the Recommendations) through adoption of Resolution WHA 63.14. Since then, the World Health Organization has commissioned a Framework Implementation Report which I co-drafted with a view to putting some flesh on the bones of the Recommendations and provide guidance to Member States on how best to implement them. 

The project is a follow up to the adoption of the Recommendations as interpreted by the Framework Implementation Report. It seeks to provide further guidance to Member States on how these Recommendations could help to improve the regulatory framework at a national level. It is therefore intended to assist policy makers and other stakeholders in developing the legal skills required to design food marketing policies. This will, in turn, contribute to the adoption of more effective childhood obesity prevention strategies.

The project is divided into three distinct, closely related phases. The first phase consists of a six-month placement at the headquarters of the World Health Organization in Geneva, in the Unit dealing with population-based prevention for diet and physical activity as two major risk factors for non communicable diseases. Using the Framework Implementation Report I co-drafted, I will provide direct support to a selected number of Member States from across the WHO Regions, including the UK as well as a range of low and middle income countries, to identify potential barriers to implementation and develop potential solutions. I will work on developing a specific evaluation tool which the selected Member States will use to identify the barriers for implementation and develop strategies to overcome them.

The second part of the project consists of the organisation of a one-day workshop in London which will focus on what the UK should do to fully comply with the Recommendations. This workshop will be designed specifically for all stakeholders directly or indirectly involved in the decision-making process and will ensure their participation at all stages of the workshop, from its preparation to its delivery and dissemination.

The third and final part of the project consists of the publication of a book in English on the regulation of food marketing to children which will capture existing knowledge on this issue and allow for its broad dissemination. It is therefore intended to support the development of effective childhood obesity prevention strategies at both national and international level.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Firstly, the project will assist WHO and policy makers in developing the legal skills required to design food marketing policies. It will therefore contribute to the adoption of more effective childhood obesity prevention strategies at national, regional and international level. The project will be of particular benefit to the selected Member States working with the Investigator for the duration of the project, particularly during her six-month placement at WHO. It has been agreed that these States would include the UK in light of the her expertise and her knowledge of English law, as well as a selection of low and middle income countries which may not have the capacity to invest in policies restricting food marketing to children as much as growing obesity trends would require and are therefore in particular need for the development of creative solutions. The project nonetheless has the potential to reach all 193 Member States parties to the Recommendations through the sharing of the investigator's expertise with, and the training of, WHO staff members. 

Secondly, the project will benefit consumer and public health organisations as key stakeholders involved in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of obesity prevention strategies. The project will inform their advocacy campaigns for stronger restrictions on the marketing of food to children and therefore assist them in developing the tools required to promote public health objectives at national, regional and international level. In particular, it will help them counteract more effectively the misconceived argument regularly advanced by food and advertising industry operators - and often relayed by policy makers - that the constitutionally protected right to free commercial speech prevents the imposition of any restrictions on food marketing to children. 

Similarly, the project should benefit child-focused NGOs and children's rights advocacy groups, with a stronger basis to propose alternative strategies in the future. Adopting a children's rights approach to the issue of unhealthy food marketing offers much potential for law and policy reform, even though the development of obesity prevention strategies has tended to be rather low (if at all) on the agenda of children's rights NGOs/campaigners. This project aims to promote the best interest of the child in all policy areas, as mandated by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Indirectly, therefore, it should benefit children and their families, and therefore improve their welfare, particularly but not exclusively in the UK.

By developing a more thorough understanding of the arguments underpinning the debate about the regulation of food marketing to children, the project also has the potential to help food and advertising industry operators re-assess their position and more willingly embrace the need for significant changes in the discourse and the approaches they have adopted to date.

Finally, the Investigator's ability to frame the debate in more conceptual terms may also indirectly influence the thinking of policy makers and other stakeholders involved in the development of restrictions on the marketing of other products, including alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and pharmaceuticals, as part of effective public health strategies.

The project therefore has a very broad range of potential research user beneficiaries, both direct and indirect. This is due to at least three factors. Firstly, growing childhood obesity rates are a cause for concern in all countries in the world, thus making obesity a public health priority at national, regional and global levels. Secondly, obesity is a multifactorial condition which requires the concerted action of a broad range of stakeholders in a range of policy areas, including food marketing regulation. Finally, food marketing is a global issue affecting all countries in the world, thus making it an inherently international issue (see below).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73555</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UNICEF</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Chidren's Rights and Food Marketing</gtr:description><gtr:id>71EA7ED8-541C-4CE6-8F0E-13700643A1E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The work is ongoing.

Consequently, public health policy-makers entrusted with the development and implementation of obesity prevention strategies had not come to appreciate the importance of involving legal experts at an early stage of the policy process. This was not without consequences: laws, which are not merely a set of rules but fit within a broader legal system, were often ill-conceived and not always sufficiently respectful of higher norms derived from international trade law, fundamental rights law or constitutional law. As a result, the food industry, which has tended to have more legal capacity than the public health sector, has been able to rely on these higher norms in order to minimise the interference of policy-makers with their businesses, often to the detriment of public health. 

To some extent, the lack of legal capacity and the low level of engagement of the public health community with lawyers still exist. However, the impact of this project has been to significantly raise awareness on the important role legal instruments can (and should) play in promoting healthier diets, and healthier lifestyles more generally. It has done so at all levels and has targeted the broad range of stakeholders I had identified as potential beneficiaries in my ESRC application back in October 2011. 

The five-month secondment I undertook at the headquarters of the World Health Organization in Geneva from February to June 2013 has contributed to a better understanding of the opportunities the law offers for the obesity and NCD prevention agendas and has arguably had a strong 'multiplier effect', in the sense that one activity has led to another: 

- I have contributed to a better understanding within WHO (at headquarters and in its regional offices) of the importance of engaging with legal arguments to promote healthier lifestyles.
- I have worked directly with several Member States to help them develop their legal frameworks on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children.
- I have been asked to produce a report for WHO on the extent to which the WHO Recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children have been implemented in the Member States and how their implementation could be improved. 
- I have organised an expert consultation on marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Amman, Jordan, 18-19 September 2013 for the East-Mediterranean Regional Office of WHO - for whom the University of Liverpool has become one of the key partners in relation to the development of their obesity and NCD prevention agenda. 
- I have trained several non-governmental organisations working in the field of public health, consumer and children's rights protection, showing them how lawyers have a significant contribution to make in the debates surrounding healthier lifestyles.
- I have participated in several multi-disciplinary, high-profile conferences and workshop intended to promote healthier lifestyles.
- I have been asked to participate in a range of Ad Hoc expert group meetings to reflect on obesity and NCD prevention, not least the Ad Hoc Expert Group on Science and Evidence that advises the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity which the Director-General of WHO set up in June 2014. 

The one-day interdisciplinary workshop I organised in London in September 2013 has contributed to the ongoing reflection at national level on the extent to which existing rules restricting the marketing of unhealthy food to children should be reviewed in light of the WHO Recommendations my research project focused on. Several initiatives have resulted from this event: I was asked to replicate the seminar in Paris to inform the debates surrounding the marketing of unhealthy foods in France; I was invited to organise and chair a parallel session devoted to food marketing at the Annual Conference of the UK Association for the Study of Obesity in September 2014; and I became a member of a working group the British Heart Foundation has set up on food marketing to children. The proceedings of the London workshop will be published as a Special Issue of the European Journal of Risk Regulation in the first half of 2015. 

Not only has one activity led to another, but the work I have done on one NCD risk-factor - unhealthy diets - has attracted the attention of stakeholders working on other NCD risk-factors - not least tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption:

- I have produced a policy report for Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) on the compatibility of the proposals to introduce plain packaging in the UK with the recently revised EU directive on tobacco products.
- I participated in the CINDI Policy Academy which the Regional Office for Europe of WHO organised in Porto in October 2014 on the marketing of food and alcoholic beverages, where I delivered one of two keynote lectures and provided direct advice to Member States in helping them develop their laws on food and alcohol marketing. 
- I delivered a plenary talk at the Eurocare conference held in Brussels in November 2014 and whose main purpose was to reflect on the future of the EU Strategy on Alcohol-Related Harm. 
- At a more local level, I am working with local charities involved in obesity and NCD prevention. 

In light of the growing importance of tackling NCD prevention, the many questions that call for a stronger engagement of the academic community, the requests I have received for legal advice from the broad range of stakeholders I have worked with, I have decided to set up a research unit at Liverpool Law School whose focus will be on Law and NCD Prevention. It is intended to build on the expertise I have gained over the years, and have significantly developed during this ESRC project. It has been approved and will be launched later this year. One of its first activities will be the organisation in Liverpool in 2015 of a one-week bi-regional training course for WHO Member States from the East-Mediterranean and the European Regions to help States build their legal capacity and improve their advocacy strategies when addressing the growing burden of NCDs. Liverpool University is an ideal setting for this type of research, in light of its reputation in public health research. 

The book I have undertaken to write as part of this ESRC project will bring together all the knowledge and experience I have gathered over the years. It was delayed, not least as a result of the many impact opportunities which have resulted from the growing understanding that legal experts should be an integral part of the NCD prevention and control agenda. It will complement the book I wrote in 2010 on EU Law and Obesity Prevention (Kluwer Law International, October 2010), and the book I co-edited (with Alberto Alemanno from HEC Paris) on Regulating Lifestyles in Europe - Tobacco, Alcohol and Unhealthy Diets (Cambridge University Press, January 2015).

It is notable that the WHO Global Action Plan for the prevention and control of NCDs for 2013-2020 which the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly adopted unanimously in May 2013 refers specifically to the role that legal instruments can play in promoting healthier lifestyles. In many ways, this ESRC research project has contributed to the growing understanding that the unprecedented rates of NCDs worldwide require a more effective use of legal instruments; it certainly has allowed me to contribute to the provision of evidence-based solutions to defeating the unprecedented global NCD epidemic. It is however difficult to further demonstrate the extent of the impact this project has had - bearing in mind the nature of committee work and the fact that the momentum does not rest on the work of one individual alone. If one relies on the multiplier effect of my involvement both in terms of engagement and policy initiatives, as well as in terms of NCD risk factors (to cover unhealthy food, but also alcohol and tobacco consumption) and growing stakeholder engagement, there is clear evidence that the project has delivered in impact terms beyond what it had embarked upon.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BE3AEE34-CB65-4CB7-8BE3-C00E4396056F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This ESRC Follow-On grant has allowed me to contribute to a better understanding of the role that legal instruments can play in promoting healthier lifestyles, and more specifically childhood obesity prevention.

I have also started to recruit a couple of PhD students to work specifically on law and non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

Furthermore, I am working with other experts on law and NCD prevention on a range of policy-making initiatives in the UK, Europe and beyond, thus contributing fully to the development of this new discipline at both national and global levels.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F51699B0-8CB1-40C9-81E0-61037829FE05</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of a Group of International Experts on alcohol marketing to children</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>86245883-FADC-4CBF-9F22-DFC61A7FF83C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alcohol Focus Scotland convened an international working group to work on how best Scotland, within the scope of its devolved powers, could regulate alcohol marketing to protect children from its harmful impact.
