Risks of surgery need to be weighed against risk reduction benefits. Pilot research suggests that some women previously treated for breast cancer do not attempt to balance risks and benefits, but opt for RRM because they feel high levels of distress over the possibility of recurrence. Surgeons often assent to these requests for RRM. This study examines:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>whether women?s preferences for surgery represent well-made decisions or not &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the clinical and ethical considerations that inform surgeons? responses to these requests.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Thirty qualitative interviews, linked to interviews with their responsible clinicians, will be conducted with women who have experienced cancer or have high familial risk of cancer. Women over the age of 16 will be recruited from breast cancer and clinical genetics centres. Analyses will focus on speech content, but interpretations will also note inconsistencies within interviews and with linked interviews to provide insights into unspoken views and motivations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Findings will be presented in the light of contemporary thought in bioethics and decision-making. In return, the conclusions that we reach will help shape literatures in bioethics and decision-making.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our pilot work found that surgeons performed surgery for a range of reasons, typically without discussing objective risk with patients. As well as variability in practice between surgeons we also found cross-situational variations within individual surgeons. We do not suggest that practitioners perform poorly. Indeed, we have no template of good practice with which to make comparisons, nor do we yet sufficiently understand the contexts within which individual decisions are made. Nonetheless, we are concerned ethically in two respects. First, while practitioners' existing solutions to RRM decision-making have presumably evolved in response to the dilemmas associated with this decision, it cannot be said whether these solutions are clinically or ethically defensible. That is, patients might be having surgery that is not in their interests, or they might not be having surgery that is in their interests. Moreover, whether or not the final decision reflects their interests, it is not known whether the processes of decision-making respects ethical requirements, for example for patient autonomy. Secondly, inequity of care is inherent in the variation in decisions and consequent potential for patients to receive differing care according to the clinician with whom they consult or, indeed, the way in which they present their needs. The ultimate impact that we seek is therefore to stimulate and inform practice which enhances the ethical standard and patient outcomes of decision-making in relation to RRM and which minimises inequity in care 
 
Ultimately, the research will contribute to the development of guidelines that will assist practitioners and patients to make considered and ethically defensible decisions. We are well integrated into the clinical and professional networks locally (e.g. Merseyside and Cheshire Cancer Network) and nationally (e.g. British Association of Surgical Oncology) through which we will aim to achieve this once our work is disseminated (see impact Pathways Document). Although the development of guidelines is not the immediate outcome of the present study, this project has the potential to generate short-term practical benefits for changes in practice. First, we anticipate change in practice locally as a direct result of the study as we identify, clarify and interpret key clinical and ethical issues in everyday practice. Kleinman (1999) suggests that high-quality observational work, of the kind we propose, can lead individual practitioners to review and, perhaps, modify their practice. Second, we will disseminate our findings to practitioners and patients through the website of the Liverpool Psychology in Cancer Care Research Group, regional networks such as the Merseyside and Cheshire Cancer Network, nationally through professional organisations, and internationally through conferences and publication. In this way we will be able to inform practitioners and patients and therefore influence their practice. This first phase of dissemination will be important in preparing for adoption of future guidance. Therefore we take very seriously the need to disseminate our findings carefully and constructively to a professional audience as well as academic ones. The attached Impact Pathway statement describes our dissemination strategy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>170392</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Risk Reducing Mastectomy (RRM) is the surgical removal of breast tissue to reduce the risk of breast cancer (BC). Bilateral RRM reduces risk of an initial BC in women without BC and contralateral RRM reduces risk of new cancer in the opposite breast. The procedure is controversial due to surgical risk and the potential iatrogenic effects of surgery on body image and self-perceptions of femininity. Current NICE guidance (CG164) specifies that RRM be offered to women at high-risk of BC, defined by identified or suspected genetic mutation. This position is supported by evidence that life expectancy benefits of RRM might be confined to this group, although RRM may prevent BC ocurrence in lower-risk groups. This study was designed to better understand how patients and clinicians viewed RRM and jointly negotiated issues of cancer risk, surgical risk and potential iatrogenic effects to reach a decision about whether RRM surgery is suitable.

Data analysis has been completed and three papers written for publication. These are 

Brown, SL., Whiting, D., Fielden, HG., Saini, P., Beesley, H., Holcombe, C., Holcombe, S., Greenhalgh, L., Fairburn, L., Salmon, P. (under review). Avoiding the greater terror: how women form preferences for risk-reducing mastectomy surgery. Submitted to Social Science and Medicine.
This paper describes decision-making from the the patient's point of view. Patients largely saw RRM as a way of resolving their fears of BC, and requested it for this reason. Patients generally made decisions intuitively and did not extensively deliberate over their decisions before making them. 

Fielden, H.G., Brown, S.L., Saini, P., Beesley, H. &amp;amp; Salmon, P. (under review). How do Women at Increased Risk of Breast Cancer Perceive Risks of Cancer and of Risk-Reducing Treatments and Decide Between Them? A Narrative Synthesis of Qualitative Research. Submitted to Patient Education and Counseling.
This paper covers the literature review that we performed as part of the project. The paper is a synthesis of qualitative data on how women decide on the most suitable strategy to manage high BC risk. The paper strengthens the conclusions of the first paper. 

Brown, SL., Whiting, D., Fielden, HG., Saini, P., Beesley, H., Holcombe, C., Holcombe, S., Greenhalgh, L., Fairburn, L., Salmon, P. (paper in preparation). Testing and moulding patients' decisions: How clinicians respond to women's requests for risk-reducing mastectomy surgery. 
This paper examines how specialist nurses, genetic counsellors and surgeons responded to patients requests for RRM. We describe how clinicians respond empathically to patients' distress, but must also decide whether patients' preferences for RRM are well-founded and whether RRM is in patients' best interests. We make recommendations regarding how clinicians can approach these tasks. We anticipate that this paper will be submitted to a journal in about one month's time.

Taken together, these findings show the centrality of patients' distress over the possibility of BC in both their and clinician' decision-making. This distress is not necessarily proportional to risk and not confined to patients meeting CG164 criteria. Most but not all clinicians considered this distress when making decisions about RRM, and patients were commonly offered RRM despite not belonging in a high-risk category. Our ethical analysis concludes that offering RRM to these patients can be appropriate and we specify how and when decisions about RRM could be made.

Our impact plan has three objectives; 1) to promote and inform discussion amongst clinicians, particularly surgeons who are responsible for offering RRM, regarding how they could approach RRM decision-making; 2) to provide patients with information that will promote what we see as good decision-making about RRM, and 3) to feed into the development of NICE guidance regarding RRM. All three objectives require that we can be confident about our findings and that others can share this confidence. Thus, we wish to first publish all three papers to provide a platform to create impact. We are awaiting referees comments to our current papers to decide how such a paper may best be written to influence this audience.

At a national level, leverage will be through the Association of Breast Surgeons (ABS), which represents approximately 80% of British breast surgeons. The ABS endorses and publishes guidelines in the European Journal of Surgical Oncology (EJSO). A member of the research team, Professor C Holcombe, is a past chair of the ABS and carries considerable influence in the ABS. The EJSO is a publication target for the third paper, and we plan to use Prof Holcombe to promote and defend the paper in that ABS. We have already contributed to discussion of RRM amongst clinical psychologists through presentation of our arguments at the Special Interest Group for Psychologists working in oncology and palliative care, a faculty of the Division of Clinical Psychology of the British Psychological Society conference in 2013.

We are funded by Liverpool PCT to develop evidence-based information about our research on emotional reactions to cancer. We are awaiting feedback from referees for our papers. Upon receipt of this, we will develop a lay summary of our findings and provide advice for women considering RRM. We will publish this on the Liverpool Psychology Service for Cancer website, which is promoted to our patients. Further, the Liverpool Psychology Service for Cancer is a Macmillan adopted service. We shall therefore provide these materials to Macmillan and ask Macmillan to promote these for wider distribution.

Our ultimate aim is to use these findings to influence the development of guidance. NICE has recently issued upgraded guidance (CG164 - 2013) to clinicians regarding the treatment of people at risk of breast and ovarian cancer. NICE guidance is specifically commissioned by the Department of Health to meet strategic needs. Whilst the recent issue of guidance confirms DoH interest in this area, it is unlikely that a further revision of guidance is imminent. Nonetheless, this work, and that of others, provides a body of thought that will be invaluable in shaping such revision. Mr. John Winstanley, who advised us on the development of the project, is closely involved in the development of NICE guidance in the area. We have the benefit of his advice in informing us of NICE activities in this area and how to influence them.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1D359CEA-934D-47FA-8551-E730297274EF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project yielded new and valuable information regarding the reasons that women did or did not choose risk reducing mastectomy (RRM). As expected, we did not find that women used epidemiologically-derived estimations of risk magnitude, and many explicitly refused to do so. Instead, we found that patients unanimously saw RRM as a legitimate procedure that represented an effective way by which they could assuage their fears about breast cancer (BC). Thus, many patient decisions were largely made on the basis of the salience and intensity of these fears. Fear also influenced decision-making where women either felt conflicted in their choice or did not choose RRM. They either found other alternatives that made them feel safer, such as medications that prevent BC or early detection programmes, or conflicts arose between women's fears of BC and their opposing fears of RRM surgery or its consequences. For almost all women, decision-making represented a balance of their different fears and the availability of options that would make them feel safer.

Although women claimed that their decisions were made intuitively, they also claimed to have thought deeply about their choice and considered pros and cons of RRM. This paradox is partially resolved by the finding that a great deal of this thought occurred after, rather than before, the decision was made. This did not represent a process of reviewing or testing the validity of their decisions, Rather post-decisional thought was directed toward justifying or rationalising decisions already made. Nonetheless, it is important that patients did not try to construct a 'story' to convince surgeons to perform RRM, and most respected their surgeon's views and were open to these views.

Surgeons felt that RRM is appropriate to reduce BC risk and sometimes agreed to perform RRM in cases when they believed that risk reduction benefits would be low (but extant). Contrary to our expectations, surgeons did not try to establish how individual patients made their decisions. Instead, surgeons routinely employed strategies that they hoped would detect or minimise poor patient decisions rather than improve patient decision-making. These included delaying surgery to ensure that patients had time to make 'good' decisions (or at least ascertain that decisions are temporally stable), informing patients of epidemiologically-derived risk estimates for their risk of cancer, including the risks of new and secondary cancers, and the risks of surgery, and asking patients to consult a psychologist to discuss their decisions. Shared decision making is normally conceptualised as an interaction between patients and doctors to help patients to make optimal decisions. The routinized ways in which surgeons engaged patients were intended to provide patients with sufficient and balanced information to make their own decisions, but possibly did not realise the full potential of a shared decision-making approach.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Two outcomes of this research require follow-up. First, decision-making was dominated by fears of BC and RRM and its consequences. We do not necessarily believe that it is desirable or even possible to eliminate emotion from decision-making, but we will exploit recent work on emotion, intuition and decision-making to consider the possibility of rebalancing the decision-making toward considerations of risk magnitude and advocate investigations. We shall focus on this problem in the publication of our findings and prepare future research proposals to investigate it. Second, we will examine the possibilities of using the surgeon/patient relationship as a platform for assisting patients to make decisions about RRM and other procedures. Patients reported trusting surgeons and respecting their views. However, it is unclear form our findings how the two can work effectively. Based on recent work in shared decision-making and some surgeons' views about how this problem could be approached contained in our data, our papers will discuss feasible and ethically and clinically appropriate ways that surgeons can encourage patients to approach RRM decision-making or to reappraise decisions that they have already made. We shall also be pursuing this in further research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E83B3222-2FF4-41C6-9493-2412361ADD12</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D3757597-DFD9-40CD-B5BF-C36B2E09EE0C"><gtr:id>D3757597-DFD9-40CD-B5BF-C36B2E09EE0C</gtr:id><gtr:title>How do women at increased breast cancer risk perceive and decide between risks of cancer and risk-reducing treatments?
