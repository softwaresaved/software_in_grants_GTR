This teaching material will make those aspects of quantum field theory that are relevant for Casimir force calculations accessible to engineers.The phenomenon of quantum noise is well-known in quantum optics (laser physics): Just as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle makes it impossible for a particle to have at the same time a well-defined position and velocity, it also prevents electromagnetic oscillations from having a precisely zero (root-mean-square) amplitude. In lasers, this quantum noise plays an important role as it can initially seed the amplification process at start-up.From the electromagnetic perspective, any device consists of components that reflect or absorb light, and hence comes with a characteristic set of higher harmonics , analogous to a musical instrument. Again, as with a musical instrument, the frequency structure of possible oscillations strongly depends on the geometry of the device (e.g. a drum in the acoustic case). Even if no oscillation is excited (the instrument produces no sound), all the harmonics nevertheless are individually subject to quantum fluctuations, and as any change of the geometric set-up ( tuning the instrument ) shifts the oscillation frequencies, the changes in quantum noise energies give rise to a measurable force: the Casimir effect .While these quantum forces are unimportant for large bodies, they become quite strong for systems where typical gap dimensions are in the range of tens of nanometres. In particular, they are a major cause of stiction in nanomachines - i.e. device failure by one part of the machine coming in contact with and sticking to another. Their behaviour unfortunately often defies naive intuition: while one would expect that surfaces moving away from one another would induce a shift to lower oscillation frequencies, hence less energy, a detailed investigation shows that Casimir forces normally are attractive. Nevertheless, under very specific conditions, repulsion could be demonstrated in some cleverly designed systems involving certain immersion liquids. Also, as these forces strongly depend on the geometry and on optical absorption properties in unusual ways, reliable quantitative computations are infamous for being very difficult - or rather, essentially infeasible without resorting to rather novel and adventurous computational approaches.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is a contribution to strengthening the UK nanotechnology, and especially, nanosensors industry, both via helping with technology development, and via training of skilled experts. Nanosensors are bound to play an increasingly important role in a number of domains, including for example: * Medical diagnosis * Environmental monitoring * Precision measurements in physics * Security related applications As such sensors can at the same time be fast, effective, highly sensitive, deployable in a broad range of situations, and (in the long run) comparatively cheap, they have considerable potential to become as ubiquitous in daily life as optical CCD sensors by now have become in digital cameras, cell phones, notebook computers, and other devices. Furthermore, as the sensor industry can be fairly effective in generating lasting economic value from a comparatively small investment of energy and mineral resources -- even more so for services (e.g. testing centres based on the availability of novel sensors) -- there is an important strategic aspect to investments in high-value-output-per-unit-of-resource-input sectors of the economy. In addition to this, some by-products of the proposed research have the potential to create additional benefits. In particular, the mechanics extension to the continuum physics simulation codebase that is shared with other research projects will for the first time allow quantitative studies of the dynamics of magnetic nano-particles, which eventually may be exploited in the long run for applications such as magnetodynamic chemotherapy. The contribution of this research project to these long term goals is to facilitate computational simulations for engineering design. In order to ensure that nanotechnology design engineers get maximum benefit from this project, special attention will be paid to an effective dissemination of research outcomes. This means that, on the one hand, it must be possible to `test drive' any software produced (even for an extended period of time) without going through tedious installation procedures first. On the other hand, as the physical effect addressed in this work is fairly counter-intuitive, teaching material will be developed that provides sufficient physical background on quantum forces to design engineers to effectively use simulation tools and interpret results without requiring previous detailed training in quantum electrodynamics. In addition to these knowledge-transfer related activities, research outcomes will be presented at one national and one international conference, as well as in peer reviewed journals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96332</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H049924/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
