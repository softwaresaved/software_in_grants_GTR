In the five years since the completion of the project, sales have continued to grow and the software is now in use at several major EU companies, including Boehringer Ingelheim, F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Sanofi-Aventis. In addition, an agreement has been reached with CAChe Research (www.cacheresearch.com) to advertise and market Cepos products in the United States. The establishment of Cepos Insilico has enabled the software modules developed during the research to be made available to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. This allows industry to take advantage of recent advances in the derivation of quantum mechanical molecular surface properties, particularly in the initial stages of the drug development pipeline and in the prediction of physico-chemical molecular properties. The release of a free version of the core module (ParaSurf) to academic groups has encouraged the use of these techniques within academia.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1E7F3519-8D8E-4AB4-8A07-54A841722056</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This Follow-On Fund project involved researchers from four partner universities (Portsmouth, Aberdeen and Southampton in the UK and Erlangen in Germany) who had previously developed a number of innovative

computational techniques for the analysis of molecular properties using quantum mechanical descriptors. These methods were seen as complementary and a collaborative team was established between the universities to develop the methodology and commercialise the technology. As part of this collaboration, funds were secured to undertake a RCUK Basic Technology Initiative Proof of Concept study (GR/S71477/01). Following the success of this study, a nascent company, Cepos Insilico, was established to market the technology. The

aims of the Follow-On Fund project were to continue this collaboration by refining the scientific techniques, organising the technology into a suite of commercially viable software modules and developing a business strategy to establish Cepos Insilico as a trading company.



During the project the major technical objectives concerning the Cepos software modules (known collectively as the ParaShift suite) were met. Specifically, the functionality of the core software (ParaSurf) was extensively tested and refined with new features added; methodology for property-based molecular alignment was developed (ParaFit, ParaMatch); progress was made in the development of software for additional Cepos modules (ParaGraph for the characterisation of molecular properties as surface graphs and Trepan for knowledge extraction from artificial neural networks); and a further module (CypScore) was developed for predicting metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes. These developments have been reported through research publications and we have continued to publicise the technology at International Conferences through oral presentations and posters.



A market review was performed and a strategic decision was taken to concentrate on the core competencies of the partner groups. Within the available resource, this required a focus on potential customers in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. The previous draft business plan was revised, including a modified pricing schedule.



Steps were taken to protect the IPR of the company and provide a firm basis for managing and protecting the software. Licence management software was developed to support the pricing model adopted in the

business plan. Source code control and request tracking systems were introduced to facilitate software maintenance and an annual update release schedule was agreed between the partners. A website

(www.ceposinsilico.com) has been developed to market the software and provide a means for direct sales.



A highly productive workshop was held at Erlangen in April 2007 attended by all the staff involved in the project to discuss technical and business developments and future strategy.



Cepos Insilico has now been established as a trading enterprise. Contacts with potential customers were pursued throughout the project and formal presentations were made at a number of sites. As a result, the period 2006-2007 saw sales to two of the major EU chemical companies and strong interest from others. In

addition to the direct software sales, funds were secured from a large multinational chemical company for further collaborative research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A major objective of this project was to make the new research methodologies available to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries through sales of the software. At the conclusion of the project, ParaSurf was already in routine production use in three major European pharmaceutical companies and has been used successfully by one company to treat a database of 1.8 million compounds without failure.



There is considerable scope for collaboration with industry on applications derived from this research. For example, ParaSurf descriptors form the basis of a Boehringer model for hERG blockade (Kramer et al., ChemMedChem, 3, 254-265, 2008. doi:10.1002/cmdc.200700221) and for the CypScore model of cytochrome P450 metabolism developed jointly with Bayer Healthcare (Hennemann et al., ChemMedChem, 4, 657-669, 2009. doi:10.1002/cmdc.200800384). A novel scaffold-hopping technique based on ParaSurf has also been developed and tested in an MSc project performed at Roche in Basel. (Jakobi et al., J. Mol. Model., 14,

547-558, 2008. doi:10.1007/s00894-008-0302-3). ParaShift is a suite of molecular modelling software modules based on the calculation of local properties on molecular surfaces using semiempirical quantum mechanics. This is in contrast to the classical atomistic approach employed in the majority of current molecular modelling and chemometrics packages, which is 50 years old and nearing the end of its development potential. The core software package, Parasurf, calculates accurate molecular properties, including chemical reactivity and intermolecular interactions that until now have been poorly predicted. It produces a three-dimensional representation of molecules and a means of describing their properties that can be used to understand their interactions with other molecules. For example, the strength of interaction with other molecules or the ease with which they can be dissolved. The properties are described in a succinct way (using spherical harmonic expansions) enabling their use in high

throughput in silico screening. In addition, the software calculates a set of numerical descriptors from the local molecular properties for use in the prediction of biological activity or physico-chemical properties.



The overall aim of this research is to enhance understanding of the properties and behaviour of molecules and the molecular basis of drug action. In particular, this approach will have impact in the early stages of the drug-discovery process. The local properties can be used, for example, to develop a hierarchical approach to virtual

screening that can draw on continuing advances in information technology, image analysis, machine learning, topology, and data mining. Moreover, because the ParaShift in silico property prediction is fast, accurate and cost-effective, scientists engaged in the screening process can be alerted to potential problems at an early

stage in the R&amp;amp;D process.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>20CD892E-D80F-4439-9450-054C85C22892</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ceposinsilico.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F34BEC2F-DEC3-4F0D-BC7C-3BDFEC73DA65"><gtr:id>F34BEC2F-DEC3-4F0D-BC7C-3BDFEC73DA65</gtr:id><gtr:title>QSAR studies using the parashift system.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>SAR and QSAR in environmental research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/15b75a845aa3059f5074752e953b4a66"><gtr:id>15b75a845aa3059f5074752e953b4a66</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Livingstone DJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1026-776X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/738613CF-B624-4D19-9127-A5C9D5C69A76"><gtr:id>738613CF-B624-4D19-9127-A5C9D5C69A76</gtr:id><gtr:title>Artificial Neural Networks: Methods and Applications: Preliminary Entry 2104</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/05d74646be082dec485ca6df6d91a668"><gtr:id>05d74646be082dec485ca6df6d91a668</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Livingstone, David J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-58829-718-1</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8050F751-AD89-40A0-B0C9-7EAEE4A97B38"><gtr:id>8050F751-AD89-40A0-B0C9-7EAEE4A97B38</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pattern recognition based on color-coded quantum mechanical surfaces for molecular alignment.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of molecular modeling</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fafa3eb19a78acaea232fe40c8087fe6"><gtr:id>fafa3eb19a78acaea232fe40c8087fe6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hudson BD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0948-5023</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6DF9DA15-54AE-498B-9671-EC408895DC71"><gtr:id>6DF9DA15-54AE-498B-9671-EC408895DC71</gtr:id><gtr:title>Toward high throughput 3D virtual screening using spherical harmonic surface representations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of chemical information and modeling</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9bb71865527b171ac1fcc7359789d5ad"><gtr:id>9bb71865527b171ac1fcc7359789d5ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mavridis L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1549-9596</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E525985/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
