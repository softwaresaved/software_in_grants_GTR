IXICO's innovative technologies help those involved in researching and treating serious diseases to make rapid decisions and improve patient outcomes. Its clinical focus is predominantly dementia, but IXICO also support clinical studies for other disease areas in the field of neuro-degeneration and beyond.

IXICO works with many of the leading pharmaceutical companies providing clinical trial services and technology to evaluate imaging endpoints as part of their drug development pipelines. Its medical image management and analysis products are used by the global pharmaceutical industry to select patients for clinical trials and to assess the safety and efficacy of drugs in development.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FDB60AE5-F44A-4658-B387-B2230F616258</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Economic impacts

IXICO had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry where medical imaging is rapidly becoming an important tool in clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs using imaging biomarkers. IXICO's imaging biomarkers provide several benefits to pharmaceutical companies: In concept trials of AD therapies the developed biomarkers allow pharmaceutical companies to power their studies with fewer subjects. The developed imaging biomarkers do provide evidence of efficacy with around 100 subjects per arm (an &amp;quot;arm&amp;quot; in a clinical trial refers to any of the treatment groups in a randomized trial. Most randomized trials have two &amp;quot;arms&amp;quot;, e.g. untreated vs. treated groups) over 12 months rather than 400 or so per arm needed for cognitive testing. Based on a conservative cost estimate of $30k per subject enrolled, this provides a significant cost saving for the companies. Similarly, pharmaceutical companies use the developed imaging biomarkers to enrich their clinical trials. In the context of clinical trials, such enrichment allows the identification of a population of patients in whom a drug effect, if present, is more likely to be demonstrable. In AD trials that use the developed biomarkers, an increase in the conversion rate in a prodromal Alzheimer's trial from 40% to 60% saves 30% off the cost of a pair of pivotal trials that used progression free survival as an endpoint, and which might otherwise cost $800m - $1bn.

Impacts on public policy and services

The imaging biomarkers developed in the underpinning research have had a significant impact on informing the development of new guidelines for the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and low hippocampal volume in regulatory clinical trials: It now seems likely that to modify the course of Alzheimer's Disease, it is necessary to start the treatment in the pre-dementia (or prodromal) phase. The identification of patients at this stage can only be done confidently with the help of biomarkers: imaging provides a non-invasive alternative to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for this purpose. The critical importance of imaging biomarkers in AD trials has been recognised by the CAMD consortium by submitting to regulators an application to qualify low hippocampal volume as a biomarker. This submission - approved by EMA and currently under review by the FDA - incorporates key data obtained using the underpinning research described here: the availability of this technology, with the regulatory qualification, is having global impact on the design of future trials of AD medicines in the pre-dementia population. In particular, the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has issued a positive opinion on the use of MRI to measure hippocampal volume as a tool to enrich recruitment into regulated clinical trials in the pre-dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease, in which the EMA directly refers to IXICO's technology. This was the first imaging-based biomarker to be qualified by a regulatory agency.

Impacts on healthcare

The imaging biomarkers developed in the underpinning research have been so effective in clinical trials that IXICO has recently decided also to develop products for diagnostic use (Brain Health Centre). IXICO's product for diagnostics directly uses the methods described in reference of the underpinning research and has also been CE marked. It is currently undergoing trials involving 200 patients as part of new NHS brain health centres.</gtr:impact><gtr:url>http://www.ixico.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2004</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/96A2224B-9CA8-4CC6-9392-6246D4F21A47"><gtr:id>96A2224B-9CA8-4CC6-9392-6246D4F21A47</gtr:id><gtr:title>Robustness of automated hippocampal volumetry across magnetic resonance field strengths and repeat images.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Alzheimer's &amp; dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/783903a3289047360462ff7fac76e9a5"><gtr:id>783903a3289047360462ff7fac76e9a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolz R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1552-5260</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8E38E35B-B441-4407-87CF-8C290CD73058"><gtr:id>8E38E35B-B441-4407-87CF-8C290CD73058</gtr:id><gtr:title>Manifold population modeling as a neuro-imaging biomarker: application to ADNI and ADNI-GO.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>NeuroImage</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c3da85eec71df5b14685b7376e29fd4c"><gtr:id>c3da85eec71df5b14685b7376e29fd4c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guerrero R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1053-8119</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_13034</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>3BEA012A-C817-4067-8BE1-05331EBB5152</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.2  Evaluation of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
