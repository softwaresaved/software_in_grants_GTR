Various modelling tools are used to support the decision making and planning in agriculture (van Ittersum et al., 2008, Brouwer &amp;amp; van Ittersum, 2010; Ewert et al., 2011). Crop growth simulation models are increasingly applied, particularly in climate change-related agricultural impact assessments (Rosenzweig &amp;amp; Wilbanks, 2010; White et al., 2011). Model-based projections of future changes in crop productivity, for instance, are made on the basis of understanding the physical and biological processes, such as how given crops respond to reduced water supply, warmer growing seasons or changed crop and soil management (Challinor et al., 2009; Challinor, 2011; R&amp;ouml;tter et al., 2011a). 

Even though most of crop growth simulation models have been developed and evaluated at field scale, and were thus not meant for large area assessments, it has become common practice to apply them in assessing agricultural impacts and adaptation to climate variability and change from field to (supra-)national scale (van der Velde et al., 2009; van Bussel, 2011). It has been hypothesized by various authors (e.g. Palosuo et al., 2011; R&amp;ouml;tter et al., submitted; Asseng et al., in preparation) that many of those model applications involve huge uncertainties. Recently, there have been renewed efforts in improving the understanding and reporting of the uncertainties related to crop growth and yield predictions (R&amp;ouml;tter et al., 2011a; Ferrise et al., 2011; Borgesen &amp;amp; Olesen, 2011). Comparison of different modelling approaches and models can reveal the uncertainties involved. Variation of model results in model intercomparisons involves also the uncertainty related to model structure, which is probably the most important source of uncertainty and most difficult to quantify. There is both, a need quantifying the degree of uncertainty resulting from crop models as well as to determine the relative importance of their uncertainties in climate change impact assessment (e.g. Iizumi et al., 2011). That is, how much of the uncertainty can be attributed to climate models, crop models and other basic assumptions (e.g. in emission scenarios). 

Such assessment of the relative importance of uncertainties and how to reduce them, is also at the core of &amp;quot;The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement project (AgMIP)&amp;quot; (www.agmip.org). AgMIP has identified three important thematic working groups cutting across trade, crop and climate modelling: they are (i) representative agricultural development pathways, (ii) scaling methods and (iii) uncertainty analysis. In that set-up, the global AgMIP initiative shows overlaps with the objectives and tasks defined for CropM, and with FACCE-MACSUR as a whole. However, CropM and FACCE-MACSUR as a whole have the ambition to go further in terms of developing climate change risk assessment methodology than AgMIP does in other parts of the globe. Also, the high density of crop and climate data in Europe will allow the analysis of scaling and model linking methods, and uncertainty which goes well beyond the capabilities of AgMIP in other world regions. 

Model intercomparisons, when combined with experimental data of the compared variables, may also be used to test the performance of different models. Such intercomparisons can help to identify those parts in models that produce systematic errors and require improvements. There is currently a number of experimental data (for wheat and barley) available across Europe which may be used for model intercomparisons. Comprehensive data sets that would allow thorough comparisons are getting increasingly scarce and call for concerted efforts to develop such high quality data sets for different locations (agro-climatic conditions) and crops in Europe.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Testing the validity of crop models for climate change impact requires consistent data sets for model input across a wide range of environmental conditions. In CropM we distinguish several work packages (WP). The aim of WP1 is to create a common protocol for model intercomparisons across a wide range of environmental conditions. Within WP2 the relevant data will be collected from partners and stored in a common database with web-based interface for easy access. Many methods of scaling up crop models from the field to the larger spatial and temporal scale have been developed, but systematic evaluations of these methods have rarely been performed. The aim of WP3 is to improve the application of crop models at different spatial (and temporal) scales in combination with models or data from other disciplines for assessing climate change impacts on food security. In order to responsibly inform decision making, research in WP4 will address issues involved to better identify, describe, quantify and communicate the sources of uncertainty in making projections of future crop response to climate change. Part of the uncertainty is related to climate projections, another part is related to projections regarding socio-economic, land use and other environmental factors that affect vulnerability of agriculture. In addition to the above research areas CropM will also ensure that the obtained scientific advances are communicated, shared and discussed with all CropM partners. WP5 will organise topical workshops on crop modelling, exchange of scientists and web-based courses. The engagement of CropM in cross-theme modelling excercises and the linking to decision makers will be ensured through WP6 which will support the formulation of policy questions for the different case studies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>FACCE MACSUR Knowledge Hub will provide significant advance in the knowledge and methodologies for risk assessment for European agriculture and food security. The project will deliver an unprecedented detailed European fully integrated analysis. The greatest knowledge
advancement will stem from the interdisciplinary and diverse framework implemented within the project. This type of broad interdisciplinary study may lead to results that are significantly different in comparison to previous endeavours in this field. FACCE MACSUR Knowledge Hub requires a European rather than a national or local approach to achieve the objectives outlined in this proposal. Specific expertise is in certain cases only available in particular EU countries and would not be possible to find in individual countries. Additionally, the exchange skills and ToK between partners will improve the level of the scientific research and will respectively enhance the status of science in the EU. Most importantly, the dissemination of data and methodologies from this project will contribute to the objectives of the European Commission which aim to coordinate the European Science Initiative by encouraging and providing the necessary tools and support for high impact, substantial science. We will be able to highlight our results internationally and will further unify the European scientific community. Reproducible and reliable results, high impact publications and the dissemination of the results at international meetings will increase the profile of European Science and will consequently improve the ability of Europe to attract foreign researchers and result in a more competitive European Research Area. Adaptation to climate change to underpin food security is by nature transboundary.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65659</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Local-scale climate scenarios based on ensembles of global/regional climate models for regional applications in Europe was developed. We constructed the integration of 21st century climate projections for Europe based on simulations carried out within the EU-ENSEMBLES and CMIP3 projects with the LARS-WG stochastic weather generator. The aim was to update ELPIS, a repository of local-scale climate scenarios, for the use in impact assessment studies in Europe. The following is an illustration of research output in FACCE-JPI Knowledge Hub: MACSUR-Partner 25 project where these climate scenarios been used.

COMPARING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON CEREALS BASED ON CMIP3 AND EU-ENSEMBLES CLIMATE SCENARIOS. This study presents the simulated impact of climate change on cereal production for multi-model ensembles of global and regional climate models (GCMs and RCMs). The study aims are (i) to assess the sensitivity of impacts to the use of climate scenarios from specific ensembles of GCMs or RCMs, and (ii) to quantify the uncertainty in predicted impacts resulting from differences in climate models from a multi-model ensemble. The impact on cereal yield (for maize and winter wheat) was assessed under climate projections of an ensemble of 15 low-resolution GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase3 (CMIP3) and an ensemble of nine high-resolution RCMs from the EU-ENSEMBLES project. Climate projections for the middle of the 21st century (2031-2050) were stochastically downscaled to local-scale weather scenarios for two locations in the Flemish Region (Belgium) using the LARS-WG weather generator. The local weather data were applied as input in two crop simulation models: AquaCrop for maize and Sirius for winter wheat. The study showed mostly positive climate change effects on maize and winter wheat in the region. Higher yield increases were simulated under climate scenarios with less pronounced temperature increases, mainly following a less pronounced reduction of the length of the growing season. For maize, a crop that is prone to water stress and hence vulnerable to changes in precipitation, simulated impacts differ between climate scenarios from CMIP3 versus EU-ENSEMBLES ensembles. For simulated impacts on wheat, inter-model variation within an ensemble was more important than inter-ensemble variation. The dominance of inter-ensemble, inter-model or spatial variation depends on the crop of study and the relation between the regional climate and agronomic conditions. Although it can only be hypothesized that EU-ENSEMBLES-based scenarios may be more advanced than CMIP3-based scenarios for agricultural assessments due to their better performance in representing sub-GCM-grid topography-dependent changes and distribution of dry and wet days, the study results demonstrate definitely that the choice for one or another ensemble of climate models (with different resolution) adds to the overall uncertainty in impact assessments, even when the climate projections are downscaled to the local level via statistical inference. Using scenarios from RCMs driven by a limited number of GCMs is discouraged as they would probably not give a representative range of possible impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>LARS-WG weather generator is available for academic community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>75BFE077-585A-4687-98AD-38FB641CE7E7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/mas-models/larswg</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>LARS-WG is a model simulating time-series of daily weather at a single site. It can be used:

1. to generate long time-series suitable for the assessment of agricultural and hydrological risk;
2. to provide the means of extending the simulation of weather to unobserved locations;
3. to serve as a computationally inexpensive tool to produce daily site-specific climate scenarios for impact assessments of climate change.

LARS-WG version 5.0 includes climate scenarios based on 15 Global Climate Models (GCMs) which have been used in the IPCC 4AR (2007). This large dataset of future climate projections was produced by leading modelling groups worldwide who performed a set of coordinated climate experiments in which GCMs have been run for a common set of experiments and emission scenarios. Multi-model ensembles allow to explore the uncertainty in climate predictions resulting from structural differences in the global climate model design as well as uncertainty in variations of initial conditions or model parameters. The new version also improves simulation of extreme weather events, such as extreme daily precipitation, long dry spells and heat waves. LARS-WG has been well validated in diverse climates around the world.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F4851826-8CC5-4743-AD89-68D43F5FEFFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>LARS-WG has been used in more than 65 countries for research and in several Universities as an educational tool.
