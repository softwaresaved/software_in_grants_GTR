&lt;p>The project will provide a bridge between soldiers, the policy initiatives of the government, the assistance provided by Service charities and research being conducted regarding civil-military relations.&amp;nbsp;Current events have generated an increased interest in the welfare of soldiers with numerous groups conducting research or engaging in activities to assist soldiers.&amp;nbsp;This project will enable these different groups to come together and discuss their current research and initiatives.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The proposed activities would build a multidisciplinary and international network between academics, practitioners and officials regarding the issues surrounding the status of soldiers in Europe and North America.&amp;nbsp;The results of the project could have direct impact on issues relating to personnel retention, the ability of soldiers to work well with coalition soldiers, and the integration of Territorial Army or Reserve Force personnel with Regular Force personnel.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit:
- Military personnel from the United Kingdom, Canada, France and the USA
- Military Charities and User Communities such as the Royal British Legion, Help for Heroes, Army Benevolent Fund and the Imperial War Museum
- Military spouses and families
- Policy makers working on the Armed Forces Covenant
- Academics from Political Studies, Sociology, Psychology, Human Geography, International Security Studies, Philosophy
- The public in general

How they will benefit:
The project conference and workshops will bring academics, military personnel, practitioners and policy makers together to discuss current research and trends, as well as identify gaps in the research being conducted and possible issues to address in the future. The conference and workshops will emphasise user community engagement and participant numbers will aim for an academic and user community ratio of 1:1.

The conference will provide a means to present current research from not only academia but also from service charities and policy groups to a broader audience and will also provide the opportunity for a number of graduate students to present their research on the area of soldiers within society. The papers presented at the conference will potentially form part of a special edition of the Armed Forces and Society Journal. 

The workshop held in the UK will facilitate a discussion amongst policy makers, military personnel, Service charities and academics in order to share research findings, understand where support and research are lacking, and discuss possible future research and project collaboration across disciplines, user communities and nations.

The outreach activities are designed to engage communities who do not normally participate in typcial academic resources such as journal articles and conferences. The outreach programme will entail the Project Coordinator meeting with military personnel and their spouses during their coffee morning meetings to discuss what they feel is missing in the current civil-military initiatives being undertaken by the government. In addition, Mrs Travis will share with the user communities the recent findings of her research, as it has been found that these communities are not effectively accessing the available information regarding the government's policy changes to the civil-military relationship. 

Mrs Travis will also visit the Royal Military College, Canada, to engage in knowledge exchange with military and academic personnel at the College through seminars and discussions regarding her findings as well as the findings from Canadian researchers in academia and the Canadian Forces, in order to strengthen the international network and discuss any disparities between the nations.

Other outreach activities will be to engage with the Community Covenant teams in the UK to help bridge the gap between the military and society. It has been shown that amongst civilians there is a lack of understanding of who soldiers are and what they do - the outreach activities in this section of the project will aim to help civilians better understand soldiers, making the research findings from Mrs Travis' PhD available to the general public in a format that is easy to understand. This component will work closely with the Royal British Legion, the Imperial War Museum and Help for Heroes to generate knowledge exchange to the general public. The Imperial War Museum has invited Mrs Travis to participate in a meeting with the Heads of Department at the museum to discuss how they may showcase contemporary conflict at the museum. Mrs Travis will also engage in a similar collaboration with the Canada War Museum. This will enable Mrs Travis to carry-on this collaboration further, which will extend the impact of her research findings to the general public and allow Mrs Travis access to both museums' research as well as research from the Royal British Legion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21264</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Canadian Institute for Military and Veteran Health Research (CIMVHR)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Canadian Institute for Military and Veteran Health Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>BC1D165C-1513-4A12-8CEB-8344A0CB172E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research collection for this collaboration is scheduled to begin in March 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Stemming from networks created at the workshop, Canadian Institute for Military and Veteran Health Research (CIMVHR) has provided the PI, Dr Dentry-Travis, with office space at Queen's University, and other amenities suitable for a post-doctoral position, such as a computer and library access.

The above conference presentations were multidisciplinary. The fields included biology and psychology, although the conference presentations focused on the biological component of the study.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>After the many discussions from the workshop, networks were established between not only the PI and the other participants, but also between the participants. The workshop enabled the PI to establish collaborative relationships with many of the participants that has continued to be helpful years after the project has ended. For instance, DRDC attended the workshop and also recently helped the PI with a new project, providing data analysis and survey administration.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Members of DRDC attended the Canadian workshop on Soldiers' Health and Social Issues, held at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa. The main participants in this workshop were frontline health service providers for the Canadian Forces, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and defence researchers, as well as Canadian museum personnel. As the PI on this project, Dentry-Travis led the workshop discussions, which provided participants with knowledge of the services each other provide to the military community. The workshop discussions highlighted where services were not adequate and also cases where services exists but user communities were not aware of the opportunity. Frontline service providers discussed where research was needed.
The main aim of the workshop was to bring many user community personnel together for knowledge exchange, specifically to discuss their arcs of fire to ensure that services are being provided to and used by those who need it the most.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Soldiers within Society - conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3AC7A971-38B9-44A4-A5A7-C9652BED7D47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Soldiers within Society conference, held at the University of Reading hosted over 100 delegates over two days.

By being interdisciplinary the conference allowed participants who may not have encountered each other in the past to come together to discuss how they approach issues related to military social issues. In addition, by being multinational the conference provided the opportunity to understand how other nations approach potential social issues. The presenters from the conference have created journal articles and are currently in the process of publishing them individually. A book project is underway that will be titled 'Soldiers within Society'. The editors of the book include the project's lead researcher, Sarah Dentry-Travis, as well as Malte Reimann, a presenter at the conference and Lecturer at Sandhurst Military Academy. The book will include chapters from a selection of conference presenters as well as Sandhurst researchers.
Workshops - Two workshops were held at the Imperial War Museum London, United Kingdom, and the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Canada. These workshops brought together academics, military social workers, military health practitioners, military personnel and members of the media, including a BBC Defence Correspondent. Similar to the conference, the aim of the workshops was to bring people together who were working on military social issues but who may not have the opportunity to meet due to different occupations, nationality and departments. The workshops provided networking opportunities that continue to be used amongst military health practitioners, academics and military personnel. A number of journal articles are currently being written by Sarah Dentry-Travis, specifically focusing on theories of the 'soldier as victim'. An article written by Sarah Dentry-Travis that has resulted from the workshops and is currently being translated into French by the publisher is Soldiers' Perceptions of Being Valued by Society and the Government: A comparison of France, Canada and the United Kingdom, which will be published by Revue Defense Nationale.
From contacts made at the workshop Sarah Dentry-Travis is also acting as a consultant for a Canadian project aimed at providing recreational therapy for military families suffering from experiences in Afghanistan and other military related events. 
In addition, a website is nearing completion that will provide networking opportunities for all academics, military personnel, military health practitioners, media and other parties interested in military social issues.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>05F539CE-7147-46DA-97C3-8FFB1553A579</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultant for third sector veteran health initiative</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9E9C719A-B6B5-4257-B170-CE28378FE98E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Veteran Identity Panel</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FD438045-CC49-44F0-9B97-8EDBE6C83451</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FC2EC9E4-8288-417C-A3C0-57F408EA9917"><gtr:id>FC2EC9E4-8288-417C-A3C0-57F408EA9917</gtr:id><gtr:title>Soldiers' Perceptions of Being Valued by Society and the Government: A comparison of France, Canada and the United Kingdom</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Revue Defense Nationale</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/81df4541fed10c72398fefc0a1f3a49a"><gtr:id>81df4541fed10c72398fefc0a1f3a49a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dentry-Travis, S.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/23287C6C-F3C9-4252-AF93-6E74BB4A8BA0"><gtr:id>23287C6C-F3C9-4252-AF93-6E74BB4A8BA0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Canadian Soldiers' Constructions of their Role-sets</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Personal Construct Theory and Practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/81df4541fed10c72398fefc0a1f3a49a"><gtr:id>81df4541fed10c72398fefc0a1f3a49a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dentry-Travis, S.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8F6C03A7-B8A9-4D9E-9C06-62282EF582D2"><gtr:id>8F6C03A7-B8A9-4D9E-9C06-62282EF582D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Valued or Forgotten?
