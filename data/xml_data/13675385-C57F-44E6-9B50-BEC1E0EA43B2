Smuggling of human beings has become a key priority action in the wider EU policy agenda on transnational organized crime. The ongoing refugee crisis has brought policies against migrant smuggling to the fore of EU and national agendas; and unprecedented budgets are being dedicated to this arena by countries including the UK. Little attention has been paid however to the extent to which current EU actors' policies and practices, which increasingly merge policing, criminal justice and military approaches, are 'fit for purpose' in countering smuggling and their effects on wider trust-based relations in society.
More knowledge and facts-based policies are needed as regards the effects of criminalisation of facilitation of entrance and residence on irregular immigrants and asylum-seekers and on the work of NGOs and volunteers, and the extent to which alternative (bottom up) and multidisciplinary strategies and approaches are better suited to effectively address the smuggling phenomenon without undermining fundamental rights and social trust-based relations in the EU.
This Project aims at precisely developing this knowledge by mapping the field of 'anti-smuggling policy' agencies and their priorities, approaches and activities, in the production of knowledge at EU levels. It will provide a bridge between current EU policies and actors and the experiences, views and testimonies of civil society organisations and volunteers. This will allow for a better understanding of the scope, nature and effects (and effectiveness) of current EU policy approaches and priorities. 
The Research Group that has been designed for implementing the project is strongly suited to ensure the highest quality and academic excellence in the research outputs, as well as linking the research results to public policy debates with relevant EU and national policy makers, law enforcement practitioners and civil society representatives. A new Partnership has been established for the purposes of this project composed by Queen Mary London University, CEPS and PICUM. This will ensure a comprehensive coverage of the project objectives and the success of the expected results. CEPS will guarantee the policy relevance and impact of the project results. PICUM will play a decisive role in securing the contributions and involvement of EU and national civil society organisations. 
The associated risks of policies that seek to tackle transnational crime upon both victims of crime and on host societies is an issue that is gaining increasing attention in scholarship Yet, to date, the impact of anti-smuggling laws and policies on the stakeholders seeking to assist asylum seekers and migrants, including ordinary citizens, remains a hidden narrative. This proposal seeks to rectify this by exploring the impact of transnational anti-smuggling measures on humanitarian assistance and trust-based relations in society. It seeks to make a highly original and timely contribution towards more effective and fundamental rights-compliant policies countering the smuggling in the European Union (EU). The 2015-2016 'refugee crisis' has illustrated the challenges of effectively responding to the phenomenon of smuggling and of fighting against the exploitation of asylum seekers. A key dilemma concerns the need to ensure a clear differentiation between exploitative smugglers and humanitarian actors. The refugee crisis has also shown the lack of effective responses by some national authorities. This has brought many new humanitarian actors into the field; from lifesaving teams to new non-governmental organisations and volunteers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will ensure that the beneficiaries extend beyond the academic communities and cover key EU and national policy makers and law enforcement, border and defence practitioners engages in different ways and forms in anti-smuggling policies. The Project will engage in a structured policy dialogue with these communities in an attempt to bridge the research results to policy relevant discussions on ways to counter smuggling in the EU. 
The role and reach of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, a leading think tank, in the main network, will facilitate extending the scope of beneficiaries towards policymaking worlds. CEPS will organize a Policy Makers and Practitioners Focus Group for the purposes of this project which will combine the participation of EU policy makers' representatives of European institutions and EU Agencies. During the course of the project the Focus Group will meet once in Brussels to discuss the policy dilemmas inherent to criminalisation of smuggling and the provision of humanitarian assistance, and the feasibility of alternative approaches in countering smuggling. CEPS will also produce a Policy Brief presenting the policy relevant findings of the project and a set of policy recommendations addressed to EU and national policy makers.
Civil society organisations and NGOs representatives will also benefit from this action. They will be centrally involved in feeding their views and experiences and knowledge to feed future public policies on anti-smuggling. They will be able to utilize and use the project activities and results in their advocacy work. The project will also provide key insights for the development of joint campaigns and actions for more humanitarian and human rights based policy responses in the EU. 
The involvement of the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (PICUM) as one of the partners will facilitate reaching out to the right actors and practitioners on the ground. PICUM has 149 member organisations and more than a 100 PICUM supporters who are involved in humanitarian activities concerning undocumented migrants or persons that work in policy, research and simply want to contribute to the mission of PICUM. The establishment of the Web-based source of stories and testimonies of NGOs and individuals facing various forms of criminalisation will play a crucial role in bringing on-the-ground evidence on the intended and unintended effects of anti-smuggling policies.
The project will also implement a targeted dissemination strategy of its activities as well as preliminary and final results. All the project results will be widely disseminated among the partners' contacts. The publication of the research outputs in academic venues will facilitate reaching out to wide inter-disciplinary academic communities. CEPS will guarantee that the results reach relevant policy makers. Social media tools will be particularly used to communicate progress results and activities. PICUM will facilitate the dissemination of the results across NGOs and civil society organisations.
