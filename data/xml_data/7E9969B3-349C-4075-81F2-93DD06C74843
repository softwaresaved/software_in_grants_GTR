If so, what is to be considered slavery and what is not; in other words what are the legal parameters of this notion of slavery? This is an open question as the European Court of Human Rights says 'slavery' only entails legal ownership; the Yugoslav Tribunal says that a number of indicators are relevant beyond ownership, while the Australian High Court says that the 1926 definition is meant to deal with cases, not of ownership, but of de facto slavery'.\n\nThe proposed research will seek to establish what is to be considered as slavery in law. A group of twenty scholars, experts in their fields will meet on two occasions to give presentations and exchange ideas as to what the legal term 'slavery' means. These presentations will then be collected and published in an edited book and disseminated through concise 'International Guidelines' meant to assist judges and legislators.\n\nThe legal definition of slavery was established by the League of Nations in 1926 as the 'status or condition of a person over whom any or all the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised'. This definition of slavery apparently has its roots in Roman law, it deals with issues of property, of human rights, and has a legacy of application in a number of countries most noticeably during the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade. \n\nThe group of scholars, known as the Research Network, is made up of leading academics in the history and sociology of slavery; and legal scholars from various fields of law. They will consider the definition of slavery. They will meet on two occasions; first in the UK, to provide a tentative outline of the approach as to their understanding of the meaning of 'the powers attaching to the right of ownership'. At the second meeting to be held in the United States of America, the participants will deliver the first draft of their work, with two participants providing a critique and the floor being open to discussion and comments. Based on those discussions, the participants will rework their draft and provide it for publication in an edited volume entitled Slavery: The Powers Attaching the Right of Ownership.\n\nEstablishing the parameters of the definition of 'slavery' is fundamental to dealing with twenty-first century human exploitation. The importance of determining what the definition means is to be found in part in the fact that there is conflicting case-law, that the 2002 International Criminal Court has determined that enslavement is one of the crimes under its jurisdiction, and that 'slavery' is mentioned in the 2000 UN and 2005 Council of Europe trafficking conventions as a crime that should be suppressed. \n\nThe central aim of the Research Network is to bring together for the first time, experts in different areas of the law and on the issue of slavery from the UK and the USA to consider a topic which has gained renewed importance in the twenty-first century. Beyond this hard core objective, the Research Network comprises a number of early career academics and postgraduate students who will benefit from their interaction with leading academics. The Research Network will also comprise individuals from outside the research community, working for the leading anti-slavery nongovernmental organisations in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50568</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The finding, set out in the Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines on the Legal Parameters of Slavery have transformed the landscape of anti-slavery activities as for the first time the law is being utilised as a tool to deal with modern slavery.

The Guidelines are use by the leading anti-slavery NGOs -- Anti-Slavery International, Free the Slaves, and Walk Free -- as their definition of slavery.

The Guidelines are used as the basis of the 2013 Global Slavery Index, which measures the prevalence of slavery in 167 countries.

I was also used the basis of the definition of slavery in the Joint Committee draft of the UK Modern Slavery Bill 2014.

In 2016, I was an Witness for the Government of Brazil before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights providing expert evidence of the legal content of slavery, servitude, and forced labour, in line with the findings of the Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines.

The Guidelines have now been translated into Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish and Russian.

The finding now underpin the vary study of modern-day slavery, as they give life -- for the first time -- to the legal definition of slavery first established in 1926.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2E6C8F65-FF0A-4E71-A1B2-37E453BC69ED</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Research Network funded by the AHRC allowed for a paradigm shift where the law of slavery is concerned.

Previous to the development of the Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines, it was comment currency that the established definition of slavery set out in the 1926 Slavery Convention was only applicable to cases where one person legally owned another. 

The Guidelines, the product of my historical research and legal analysis coupled with the work of the leading scholars of property law, the history of slavery, modern slavery and the law of slavery, allow us to develop an understanding of that definition which is both internally consistent and capture the lived experience of modern slavery. 

Where previously the law did not apply to cases of slavery, the Guidelines demonstrate otherwise.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key findings are the Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines (and the OUP collection under my editorship entitled: The Legal Understanding of Slavery).

The way forward comes as a result of me being a CI on an AHRC Care for the Future Large Grant entitled The Antslavery Usable Past (PI: Kevin Bales) which has money allocated for translation and dissemination of the Guidelines.

The Guidelines have been presented to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and may find their way into the case-law of it, and other courts throughout the Western Hemisphere.

As for being used by others, the Guidelines are meant to assist judges, prosecutors, and the police in seeking to suppress modern slavery through the legal system. Dissemination looks to target, inter alia, international judges and prosecutors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>31F75931-8EF9-445A-B693-82F359CC0AEC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G018499/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
