In collaboration with Ripon Citizens Advice Bureau, the Principal Investigator (PI) will set up a specialist advice and advocacy service on EU welfare claims.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While advising and representing clients, the PI will also conduct a parallel study of the obstacles the clients encounter during their claims and appeals. This 'advice led ethnography' is an innovative new approach, especially in the context of EU law. It combines socio-legal studies with theoretical, philosophical and historical work on EU social law.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In focussing upon the reality of making EU-law based welfare benefit claims, and identifying specific procedures, possible barriers and possible implications, this project has a number of social and legal policy impact ambitions, and aims to target the following beneficiaries: 

Advisors: Those working with EU migrants and trying to help them to assert EU law based claims should benefit from the findings of the research, as the project will highlight particular avenues of argument for making EU-law based claims, that might otherwise be missed. In outlining administrative procedures that are encountered, advisors will be better informed about the full pathway of a claim and may feel more confident about going beyond a first interview with clients. In identifying possible barriers, it should help advisors to anticipate and so begin to tackle these barriers. 

EU migrants: Those assisted as part of the project should receive advice and help to make informed decisions, and support in choosing from options and in taking action. However, the findings of the project should help a broad range of EU migrants, through highlighting the difficulties faced in realising their rights - information which is not just useful to them but which should increase public awareness of the obstacles they face, and the relationship between such obstacles, and nationality and disability. 

Administrative decision makers: This project should provide useful feedback to administrative decision makers on the fairness of, and any drawbacks to procedures for pursuing benefit claims. Organisational policies, as well as legal obligations, will be tested and held up against the reality of the claims experiences. This feedback should include suggestions about service delivery and on good practice generally. 

Monitoring bodies: The findings of this project should provide valuable monitoring information to bodies tasked with ensuring the correct implementation of and judicial respect for EU law. These would include the House of Lords Select Committee on EU law, the European Commission and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which is also tasked with monitoring compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. These specific societal impacts should have more diffuse economic impacts, related to social inclusion and labour market engagement. 

Non-governmental organisations: The themes of this project - administrative justice, indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality and disability, and the rights of EU migrants - mean that the analytical findings should provide not material to help with education and/or campaigns ideas or angles for NGOs working with migrants or persons with disabilities, and organisations who are interested in administrative fairness, and/or the European constitutional project.

Legal practitioners, judges: The legal system, with presumptions of fairness, has reasons to hope that it is backed up by good administrative decision-making and fair administrative procedures, not only to avoid excessive, costly litigation, but also to ensure the integrity of the system as a whole. Practitioners and judges would have an interest in knowing what the many claimants have been through who never reach a higher court, and so how most of the decision making happens which is otherwise invisible to them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>128540</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Full Fact blog on Child Benefit dimension of EU-UK New Settlement</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1920B23A-1AB2-4778-B1AF-2110BDC4700F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>FullFact commissioned a series of analyses on the 'New Settlement' conducted by 'some of the country's leading experts in EU law'; I was invited to contribute the one on Child Benefit: https://fullfact.org/europe/explaining-eu-deal-exporting-child-benefit/</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://fullfact.org/europe/explaining-eu-deal-exporting-child-benefit/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contributed to expert panel in the Guardian on free movement of workers and Brexit</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B907A7FA-CA1E-4650-8EC5-2C54740878BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Asked to write a response to a query about different models of the free movement of workers</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/mar/29/would-brexit-make-harder-hire-eu-workers-referendum</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Genuine Prospects of Work Test</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3907C754-A855-431B-B589-22DB65D3322F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to present at Child Poverty Action Group specialist seminar on the Genuine Prospects of Work test</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>YorkTalks 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B03084F-FC1D-4FA1-965E-58D71CC31407</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave talk at YorkTalks 2016 entitled 'EU migrant Benefit cuts: the pillory, the precipice and the slippery slope'.

Equal treatment on the grounds of nationality is illusory when it comes to welfare law. There are multiple administrative obstacles to asserting EU nationals' welfare rights, and these are made more acute in times of legal transition. Administrative and legal obstacles interact so that legal changes and increased restrictions augment administrative obstacles, through e.g. increased decision-maker confusion and steering decision makers to restrict rights rather than facilitate them, promoting a refuse-first culture. I have developed a theory of declaratory discrimination by the State, arguing that government communications amount to declarations of an intent to discriminate and/or create obstacles to movement.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Key findings will inform potential judicial review claims, and the gathering of evidence for responding to Social Security Advisory Committee consultations;
