According to the 2011 Census, individuals from BME groups comprised 14 per cent of the total population in England and Wales, with the Indian, Pakistani and Black Caribbeans being the largest groups. These estimates also reflect the younger age structure of the minority ethnic population, with about one-quarter of the UK?s total population aged 25-44 coming from BME groups , partly as a result of net international migration particularly from Eastern Europe but also from Old Commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada.&lt;br />&lt;br />This project analyses data from Understanding Society and the Labour Force Survey, in order to understand the pension prospects of individuals who are currently of working age, and individuals above the State Pension Age.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project aims to examine differences between the BME population and the White majority; between different minority ethnic groups; between different cohorts of BME groups; and between men and women, in order to inform the future design of policies in the area of pension protection for BME groups.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ESRC Secondary Data Analysis scheme is aimed at producing high-impact and policy-relevant research through the exploitation of existing data resources, and the proposed research will deliver such impact in five distinct ways:

Firstly, by utilising Understanding Society and the Labour Force Survey, the proposed research will directly contribute to the maximisation of existing ESRC data resource investments and ONS resources. Through the secondary analysis of the two datasets, the project will also contribute to another of the ESRC's priorities in the form of the expansion of the UK's skills base in quantitative data analysis, as the Co-I is an experienced quantitative researcher and the PI is a less experienced researcher who is currently investing in the use of quantitative methods as part of her research plans and outputs.

Secondly, the project is aimed at investigating a topic area with crucial policy implications, as the UK population is simultaneously ageing and becoming increasingly more diverse in terms of its ethnic composition. The investigation of pension protection for current cohorts of older persons, and of the prospects of pension protection for future cohorts of elders from BME groups, will strengthen the evidence base which can inform the design of social policy in the future.

Thirdly, from a methodological viewpoint, the project will develop our understanding of the determinants of pension protection, and particularly occupational scheme membership, for individuals from BME groups. Existing research draws a direct link between employment patterns and pension eligibility, however in the case of BME groups, there is evidence that cultural and institutional factors may contribute to individuals' decisions to enter the labour market or not, to seek an occupation in a particular industry sector, or to contribute to an occupational or private pension scheme.

Fourthly, the research is aimed at facilitating knowledge exchange between members of the academic community (eg. at the scientific meetings), between academics and key policy stakeholders in the area of ethnicity and pensions (eg. Department for Work and Pensions, Policy Research Institute on Ageing and Ethnicity), and between academics and the wider public (eg. Age UK, Southampton Pensioners Forum). Through a strategy which includes peer-reviewed academic outputs, a Knowledge Exchange Workshop and a Briefing Paper which will be widely distributed in electronic and hard-copy format, the project will engage users, stakeholders and academics alike, with a view to making a high impact on the debate in this area.

Finally, by combining a more and a less experienced researcher in quantitative data analysis (the Co-I and the PI respectively), the project will address the ESRC's priority of developing capacity in quantitative data analysis in the Social Sciences, at the same time as utilising data resources which represent significant investments for the ESRC.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>155059</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Age UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration in disseminating research findings with AgeUK</gtr:description><gtr:id>92B73682-21B0-44C9-B36A-6929379C5DB4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>AgeUK continues to be a close partner of the Centre for Research on Ageing in the University of Southampton.

Academic literature over the last two decades has emphasised the health and socio-economic disadvantage experienced by BME groups, as well as the key policy challenge associated with the ageing of the BME population, and with their pension protection in particular. For example, more than half of Pakistani and Bangladeshi older people (60 and over), half of Indian older people and about one-third of Black Caribbean older people, are in the bottom-fifth of the income distribution, while pensioners from these groups are more likely to rely on means-tested benefits. This paper analyses data from the first wave of Understanding Society, a nationally-representative dataset with information from individuals in over 40,000 households in the UK, in order to explore patterns of state pension receipt and the determinants of membership in an occupational pension scheme among older people aged 65 and over in five ethnic minority groups: Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani, Caribbean and African. In addition, the paper revisits existing research exploring the interaction of ethnicity and gender to the detriment of pension protection for both women and men of working age from the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities.

With regard to Societal impact, the project's findings were presented and discussed as part of a number of knowledge-exchange workshops, for example organised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on ethnicity (Jan 2014); organised the Centre for Research on Ageing in collaboration with AgeUK (Oct 2014); and organised by the ESRC Centre for Population Change and the British Society of Population Studies on Ageing (July 2015). These workshops were attended by non-academic members of the public community who were interested in hearing more about the topic of pension protection among individuals from minority ethnic communities in the UK. With regard to impact on Policy &amp;amp; Public services, the project's findings have been discussed with key stakeholders in the area of pension design in the UK, such as Stephen Balchin from the Department for Work and Pensions who acted as a discussant of the project's presentation at the JRF event; Daniela Silcock from the Pension Policy Institute who acted as a discussant of the project's presentation at the AgeUK event; and Richard Pereira from the Office for National Statistics who participated at the ESRC CPC/BSPS event. It is hoped that the key findings of the project with regard to ethnic differentials in pension protection both among working-age and older individuals, will inform the design of pension protection for individuals from minority ethnic communities in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6707FE93-A1E6-4EB8-966A-97533D29AC70</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overall aim of this research was to investigate pension protection among individuals from minority ethnic groups in Britain, using a recently available dataset which focuses specifically on Indians, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Caribbeans and Africans. The research evidenced the following key findings:

1. Ethnicity remains a significant predictor of differences in occupational pension membership among working-age individuals from minority ethnic groups.
We investigated the association between ethnicity and an individual's chances of (a) being in paid work; (b) working as an employee; (c) working for an employer who offers a pension scheme; and (d) being a member of an employer's pension scheme. The data presented provides strong empirical evidence that minority ethnicity does have a differential and negative association for different ethnic groups in the first three areas (being in paid work; being an employee; working for an employer with a pension scheme). However, ethnicity shows a significant association with one's chances of being a member of an employer's scheme only for Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals. Such individuals were significantly less likely to be members of an employer's scheme than White British individuals, however no significant differences were found for all the other ethnic groups. A notable exception and previously unknown result is that Polish individuals are the only group who are more likely than the White British to be in paid work, however they are less likely than the White British to be working as employees, or for an employer who offers a pension scheme, or indeed to be members of such a pension scheme. 

2. Ethnicity also remains a significant predictor of differences in the receipt of the state pension, an occupational/ private pension or the Pension Credit among pensioners from minority ethnic groups.
Our analysis showed that individuals from all ethnic groups (except for the Caribbean for whom the results were not significant) are less likely to be receiving the state or an occupational/ private pension. In addition, the findings build upon previous research by evidencing the differences between different ethnic groups (e.g. Bangladeshi and Pakistani individuals overall fare worse than White Other, Indian or African individuals). Importantly, such differences between ethnic groups remain even after controlling for a range of demographic, health and socio-economic characteristics. More specifically, the results which indicate higher odds among ethnic groups of receiving the Pension Credit compared to White British individuals, are a novel contribution of this paper to existing literature.

3. In addition to an ethnic disadvantage between different groups, the research revealed continuous gender differences within ethnic groups.
We found that older women are overall less likely than men to be receiving state or occupational/ private pensions. Such result may point to gender differences in the likelihood among men and women from ethnic minority groups of claiming the Pension Credit. Other characteristics indicating a lower socio-economic status, such as no educational qualifications and renting from a Local Authority or Housing Association, contribute to this finding, as do all categories of marital status other than being married.

4. Ethnic minorities are concentrated in particular geographical areas in England and Wales; and high ethnic minority concentration is associated with high deprivation in that area.
Our study found that a higher level of concentration of individuals from one's own ethnic group is negatively associated with indicators contributing to effective pension protection such as being in paid work, being an employee, and working for an employer who offers a pension scheme. However, we found that, once an individual works for an employer who offers a pension scheme, there is no further effect of one's own-ethnic-group concentration on the likelihood of being a member of an employer's pension scheme. Individuals living in deprived neighbourhoods are less likely to be in paid employment, to be employees or to be members of their employer's pension scheme. Individuals' sense of insecurity associated with unemployment and lower qualifications in deprived neighbourhoods could contribute to individuals' lower likelihood to be members of their employer's pension scheme. Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Polish individuals are also less likely to join the pension scheme than White British.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from this project provide updated empirical evidence that the gap between ethnic minorities and the White British in terms of their likelihood of being in paid work (during their working life) and having effective pension protection (during old age), has not narrowed over time. As such, these findings can be used by three key groups in society: firstly, academics can further investigate the reasons behind such gaps and their link with other areas of life where an 'ethnic disadvantage' may be experienced (eg. health status, social networks, etc). Related to this, secondly, policymakers can use such evidence to make a strong case for initiatives that aim at improving employment opportunities within communities of ethnic minorities, and at strengthening pension protection for individuals who are not working for employers offering pension schemes. Finally, the project's findings can be used by stakeholder groups aiming at improving the socio-economic position of ethnic minorities and/or older people in society, for example
