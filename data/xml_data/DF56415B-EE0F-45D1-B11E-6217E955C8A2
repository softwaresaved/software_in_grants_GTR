In a sense, representation theory is the study of symmetry: whereas a group may be viewed as an abstract set of symmetries, a representation of that group is a way of realising those symmetries through an action on a concrete object, namely, on a vector space (such as the 3-dimensional space we live in). 
Representations of symmetric groups have been investigated for more than a century: this has led to many strong results and, in particular, to beautiful combinatorial constructions. 

However, many problems remain unsolved in the study of modular representations of symmetric groups: in this context, we do not even know the dimensions of irreducible representations, which are the building blocks that can be used to construct all representations. A substantial part of the required information can be obtained through the study of representations of certain Iwahori-Hecke algebras, which is a more tractable problem. Representation theory of Iwahori-Hecke algebras is important in its own right, as it has many other applications.

In the last 20 years, spectacular connections have emerged between modular representations of symmetric groups and the so-called ``quantum groups'', which were originally defined to study the Yang-Baxter equation in mathematical physics. These connections were made particularly precise 5 years ago, after the discovery of Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier (KLR) algebras. It turns out that one can view representations of a symmetric group (or an Iwahori-Hecke algebra) as a representation of a KLR algebra. Moreover, this point of view reveals previously hidden exciting structural properties: in particular, the representations become graded. 

The aim of the project is to exploit this ground-breaking advance to the fullest possible extent. In the first part of the project, conjectures that concern certain blocks of symmetric groups and pre-date KLR algebras will be investigated from the new point of view provided by those algebras. The second part will be devoted to a study of simple modules of Iwahori-Hecke algebras through the lens of KLR algebras. The third part will be an investigation into invariants of graded Cartan matrices of symmetric groups. It is hoped that ideas will be transferred between quantum groups and representations of symmetric groups in both directions, in particular, that combinatorial constructions related to symmetric groups will influence the theory of quantum groups.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the short term, the project will make a substantial contribution to the competitiveness of UK research in representation theory through development of a strong group of UK-based mathematicians proficient in topics related to representations of cyclotomic Hecke algebras and KLR algebras. In particular, the postdoctoral researcher - a likely future expert in the area - will greatly benefit from collaborative work on the project and from interaction with the international community of mathematicians with relevant expertise. 

In the medium and long term, the project has potential for making an impact that stems from its connections to two distinct (but related) areas of fundamental importance in modern mathematics, namely, the theory of quantum groups and representation theory of arbitrary finite groups. 

More specifically, the proposed research may improve our understanding of highest-weight modules for the relevant quantum groups and the associated crystal bases. These quantum groups were first defined in the 1980s as a tool to study the Yang-Baxter equation, which appears in many mathematical models of physical phenomena (in particular, in lattice models in statistical mechanics). Quantum groups and crystal bases have also been used in the study of invariants of knots and links, which has applications in chemistry and biology, for example, to modelling DNA. 

As far as the connection to arbitrary finite groups is concerned, the project is likely to contribute to our understanding of the patterns lying behind the global-local conjectures in representation theory of those groups (for example, through insight into gradings of group algebras). These conjectures play a key role in studying representations of finite groups in general. 

Representation theory of finite groups has been applied in many different areas, for example, in the study of molecular symmetry in chemistry or - very recently - in design and use of card-shuffling machines. It is very likely that new practical applications of representation theory - as well as applications to fundamental problems of number theory - will emerge in the future, though it is virtually impossible to predict them in advance. The results of the proposed project may be reflected in those applications.

To summarise, the proposed project belongs to a highly interconnected web of knowledge and research spanning much of modern mathematics as well as parts of physics, chemistry and biology. It is not possible to predict or quantify the impact of an individual node in this web with any certainty. However, as the proposed research occupies a very central position in the web and has many deep and exciting connections, it has potential for influencing a wide body of knowledge, which in the long term may translate into impact on economy and society as well.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98450</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5BCE97D7-7226-43A1-BA54-1A809FBF9FFC"><gtr:id>5BCE97D7-7226-43A1-BA54-1A809FBF9FFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>RoCK blocks, wreath products and KLR algebras</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mathematische Annalen</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6cbeae46649013f32830d8f4dfdd9baf"><gtr:id>6cbeae46649013f32830d8f4dfdd9baf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evseev A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L027283/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
