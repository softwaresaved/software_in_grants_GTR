With a lack of continuous monitoring, and recognised testing procedures involving bacterial culturing of the water systems taking at least several days to complete, bacterial levels in the water pipes of dental waterlines and renal dialysis units can rise above recommended safety levels during patient treatment. This obviously impacts on patient well-being, more especially so for patients already compromised by illness, as in the case of e.g. renal failure patients.

Moreover, the treatment procedures adopted to clean the systems involves flushing with chemically unfriendly biocides. However, with no immediate feedback on efficacy, too much or too little can be administered. Too little, results in compromises to patient well-being and too much results in unnecessary use of potentially harmful chemicals. In contrast, continuous monitoring using our sensor, enables the right dose to be applied at the right time. Ultimately if the feasibility tests are successful, development of the proposed biofilm sensor, at a commercially viable cost, would result in take up by the international community and capture of a portion of a world-wide market share for a UK-based consortium. This in itself would also impact on job creation in a regionally deprived area; the industrial collaborating SME, Process Instruments is based in the North of England (Burnley).

Although the target market is sizeable, the diamond sensor technology is highly likely to have additional applications directly in biofilm monitoring in other water applications, such as potable water supply, swimming pools, heating/cooling water systems etc. Indirectly, the diamond also provides an ideal platform for the development of other sensors where chemical species monitoring in harsh environments, where diamond wins out over other electrochemical based sensors, is required. The diamond BAA sensor technology is thus expected to impact on, and underpin, a wide variety of applications and technologies that will be unlocked by Innovate UK Biofilm feasibility funding. All parties are committed to developing the diamond sensor technology. A successful feasibility study would also provide the necessary results to galvanise interactions between Process Instruments and both healthcare clinicians and providers of renal dialysis machines and dental unit water systems, in order to encourage take-up.

The biofilm sensor technology will also impact directly on the academic community. Through papers and conference presentations, given during this project, the academic community will be familiarised with developments made in miniaturised diamond biofilm sensing technologies (and related activities). This will act as a stimulant for future research and development into the use of such sensing platforms for a wide variety of different chemical species. This will pave the way for a new generation of diamond based electrochemical sensing devices both in the laboratory and in the commercial world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39207</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>250000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Royal Society Innovation Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Royal Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7805A6E2-DE0A-43BF-B0DC-BA7324F338C4</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P004156/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>649031FD-C21E-42D9-AC12-41ACA59CC11C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemistry &amp; physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3493671D-A4CF-4197-90A7-3CCFBE1C0627</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools for the biosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
