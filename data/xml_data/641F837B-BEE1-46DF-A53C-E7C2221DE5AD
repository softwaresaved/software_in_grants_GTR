By using a team from previous AHRC-funded projects (with members from Cambridge University, the British Library and Tibetan research institutions) it will ensure a firm knowledge base and good value for money. It will have world-wide multidisciplinary appeal for a broad range of academics and indigenous scholars engaged in the preservation of Tibetan cultural heritage and for all scholars involved in the rapidly growing international field of the history of the book.\n\nTibetan book culture reflects Buddhist ideas that texts are relics and that their distribution is an act of merit. These ideas had a significant bearing on the invention of printing in 7th century China and on its later spread throughout East Asia and the Mongolian empire, including Tibet. Inspired by the notion that books are embodiments of the words of the Buddha, Tibetans treat them as persons worthy of respect who can bestow blessings and act on people. These ideas and attitudes led to the adoption of printing technologies in Tibet and the development of a unique and unrivalled culture of books reaching far beyond the Tibetan plateau.\n\nThe project will investigate two core issues: the introduction of block printing into Tibet, and the current use of digital technologies in the preservation of Tibetan collections. A preliminary survey of 15th-16th century Tibetan block prints showed that printing technologies promoted specialised craftsmanship and led to distinctive ways of mobilising people and resources. A Buddhist morality of the book propelled the development of networks of patronage involving rulers and members of lay and monastic communities, both within Tibet and beyond, in support of printing projects. Frequent political upheavals in the Tibetan areas resulted not in the destruction of Buddhist book culture, but in more sustained efforts to recover and preserve texts. Similarly after the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) networks of monks, nuns and lay scholars emerged to search for lost collections, re-order monastic archives and recover texts; an effort now being assisted by the adoption of digital technologies.\n\nThe project builds on two previous AHRC-funded projects: one brought to light some remarkable examples of early Tibetan printing kept in the UK (especially in the Younghusband Collection) and the other published the biography of a 15th century princess who played a seminal role in the introduction of printing in the Gungthang region of Tibet where ancient libraries are still in existence. A comprehensive survey of colophons of early prints, biographies and the living tradition in this region will provide the basis for a broader exploration of the introduction of printing technologies into Tibet with their social and cultural ramifications. In addition, the project will conduct an ethnographic investigation of the hitherto undocumented process of recovery and cataloguing of texts carried out by grass-root networks of monastic and lay scholars with the help of digital technologies.\n\nThis pioneering study of cultural practices surrounding Tibetan books and printing will illuminate unexplored aspects of Tibetan Buddhist culture while providing valuable materials for comparative studies of the book. It will produce a database, a website, several academic publications, a network of world-leading scholars, a dedicated conference, and exhibitions at the British Library and in Cambridge. It will therefore provide visibility for AHRC-funded research at the academic and the popular level. It will also promote the transfer of knowledge and skills to junior scholars in the UK and Tibet and will encourage dialogue and cooperation in politically sensitive areas.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>711196</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An exhibition at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Cambridge which explores the book as artefact and as a ritual object in the Buddhist context.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D2AC6D6C-393E-4AB1-A724-71CB169C2750</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition was very popular and inspired a series of outreach activities for both adults and children.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Buddha's Word: The life of books in Tibet and beyond</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://maa.cam.ac.uk/maa/buddhas-word-the-life-of-books-in-tibet-and-beyond/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Trakar Taso Monastery</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Repatriation of texts</gtr:description><gtr:id>F2AB4DB4-9CA4-4599-B176-E499D206E4EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Digitisation of Buddhist texts and creation of open access online database has led to contribution to knowledge community.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The monasteries provided access to additional texts and printing blocks</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The named monasteries and others benefited from the project through the repatriation of textual materials, believed lost, in digital form.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kathmandu University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Nepal, State of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Repatriation of texts</gtr:description><gtr:id>5150A3DA-520C-4420-9CF7-1B2F68B509D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Digitisation of Buddhist texts and creation of open access online database has led to contribution to knowledge community.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The monasteries provided access to additional texts and printing blocks</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The named monasteries and others benefited from the project through the repatriation of textual materials, believed lost, in digital form.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Bodong Research Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Repatriation of texts</gtr:description><gtr:id>412DA374-9810-458F-982F-78CEA7D6375C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Digitisation of Buddhist texts and creation of open access online database has led to contribution to knowledge community.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The monasteries provided access to additional texts and printing blocks</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The named monasteries and others benefited from the project through the repatriation of textual materials, believed lost, in digital form.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exploring Tibetan Culture - Traditiona Printing and Papermaking</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BE44CFF7-2315-4260-B633-1BC8509ACC68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pilot exhibition displaying tools and technologies for printing in Tibet with examples of work.

In addition the project has been digitally repatriating discovered materials to Tibetan monastic and lay communities

A website and database have made rare early Tibetan prints accessible and searchable.
This project has also been used as a springboard for new applications for research funding.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A77AC82F-AB29-44FA-945C-B5304D1922B2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has been exploring the relationship between Buddhist culture and technological transformations by looking at 'the book' as artefact, medium for communication, symbol of political authority, and ritual object in the context of Tibetan Buddhism.
