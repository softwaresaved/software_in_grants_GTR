For the first time it brings together the practice-led research of visual artist, Catrin Huber, with the disciplinary perspectives and expertise of archaeologists, art historians, and digital technologists. The project is delivered in partnership with the Soprintendenza Pompei and the Herculaneum Conservation Project. With 2.5 million annual visitors to Pompeii alone, this collaboration offers an amazing opportunity to bring site-specific fine art practice and interdisciplinary archaeological research to a large and international public audience.

The Expanded Interiors research inserts itself within a particular set of archaeological explorations around Roman architecture and interiors. By focusing on wall paintings it asks questions about the place, purpose and design of Roman houses: in particular how these paintings negotiated public and private space and how they related to objects within the home. While these questions have been explored by some academics this is the first time such issues have been brought together with contemporary site-specific fine art practice or with the aim of exploring new digital approaches to the display of archaeological artefacts at open air heritage sites. 

Through archaeological and fine-art based investigation and 3D digital scanning and printing Expanded Interiors will generate and present site-specific installations within two Roman houses, the Casa del Bel Cortile at Herculaneum and the Casa dei Criptoportico at Pompeii. In doing so it will establish a bridge between the ancient methods and skills of the Roman wall painter and those used within contemporary fine art practice, providing new insights and understandings of these two different creative worlds.

We expect that the research findings and outputs generated through Expanded Interiors will be of interest to an international academic and practitioner audience that crosses the boundaries of archaeology, contemporary fine art practice, art history, museums and heritage. We will engage with these audiences through a variety of outputs and channels. A major two-day international symposium will be held at Herculaneum, during the exhibition period, which will open up our research questions and findings to an audience of artists, conservationists, historians, art historians, classicists, and archaeologists. A monograph print publication, comprising documentation of the installations and the research process and a series of newly commissioned essays, will also be produced. Published by Art Editions North this book is aimed at an international contemporary arts readership. The Expanded Interiors research will also be publicly disseminated through a project website, and through conference papers and published articles in academic and professional journals within the fields of contemporary art, archaeology, heritage and museums studies.

This is a public-facing research project that will have benefit far beyond academia. Through the on-site installations it will impact directly on the visitor audience at Herculaneum and Pompeii providing a novel opportunity to enhance and enliven the visitor experience at these two sites. By experimenting with new and innovative ways of presenting ancient buildings and objects on-site the project suggests potential new approaches to archaeological display that could be taken up and developed at other heritage sites and museum contexts. In particular it offers new understandings of the possibilities of site-specific art as a platform for public engagement with archaeology and new insights into the feasibility of the creative use of 3-D technologies within open-air museum display.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Expanded Interiors will be of direct practical and strategic benefit to both its major heritage partners - Soprintendenza Pompei (SP) and the Herculaneum Conservation Project (HCP) (Letters of Support). For SP our research contributes to its aim of extending cultural engagement and participation with the Pompeii site while for HCP it represents an important opportunity to generate new connections between the archaeological site and the community of modern Ercolano, the contemporary town surrounding the Herculaneum archaeological site. In staging the research at both Pompeii, and Herculaneum Expanded Interiors also plays a strategic role in developing research, curatorial and promotional links between the partner organisations and in encouraging visitor flow between the two sites. Through the diversity of its research outputs (on-site, online and in print), Expanded Interiors has the potential to benefit and impact on a number of very different non-academic audiences and communities of interest beyond its immediate participants and project partners. 

(1) International visitors to Herculaneum and Pompeii: 
In juxtaposing contemporary art and material artefacts from the ancient world within the on-site installations Expanded Interiors has the potential to reframe and extend the visitor' encounter with the Roman remains, introducing a new visual experience and narrative that goes beyond purely archaeological understandings. For repeat visitors the new installations offer a way to refresh past understandings of the site and its history. Encountered within archaeological venues, the art installations also have the potential to stimulate visitors' own interest in and appreciation of contemporary visual art in its own right, perhaps opening this up to an audience that may have little previous experience of site-specific contemporary art. On a practical level, the project will also benefit visitors in allowing access to archaeological artefacts (replicas) held in store, that are not normally on public view. 

(2) Local communities in Ercolano: 
Stimulating and provoking a new relationship between contemporary fine art practice and Roman archaeology is one of the key objectives of our research project. As well as doing this directly through the contemporary art installations themselves, this objective will also be delivered through an active community events programme that is focused on the contemporary population living around the Herculaneum site. Developed and delivered in collaboration with HCP's outreach team these activities will engage participants in an active exploration of the similarities/contrasts between contemporary interior decoration (as deployed within modern Ercolano), site-specific fine-art practice, and Roman period practices. These activities will also help to generate broader discussion around the cultural, social and economic value of the World Heritage Site's presence within the town.

(3) Contemporary visual arts, archaeology and heritage practitioners: 
In experimenting with new and innovative ways of presenting Roman buildings, interiors and artefacts Expanded Interiors suggests potential new approaches to archaeological display that could be taken up and developed at other heritage sites and open-air museums. In particular it offers new understandings of the possibilities of site-specific contemporary art as a platform for public engagement with archaeology. Our research also contributes new experimentation and empirical findings to what is a growing field of interest in the use of digital technologies and 3-D digitally produced replicas within archaeological investigation and museum display. As well as demonstrating and exploring these issues within the on-site installations in Italy, these ideas will be opened up and disseminated to international and online audiences through the research symposium, project website, Expanded Interiors book publication and practitioner-led journal articles.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>279794</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P007007/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology of Literate Soc.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
