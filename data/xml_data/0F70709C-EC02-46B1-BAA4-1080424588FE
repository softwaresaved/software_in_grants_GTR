2</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K000101/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposal seeks to build on the achievements of the Centre for East European Language-Based Area Studies (CEELBAS) in building UK capacity to understand and respond to developments in the strategically-important region of Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. The three development pathways outlined here are designed to enhance impact, particularly through interaction and engagement with non-academic communities, with a specific focus on the Humanities and Language elements of CEELBAS research and training (although the Centre will promote interdisciplinarity and will explore other funding sources to continue specifically social science-based activities). Phase 2 of CEELBAS offers a significant opportunity to underline and showcase the vital contributions made by Humanities and Language expertise in addressing major research and policy challenges in areas such as the changing global order, migration and mobility, security and stability, health and wellbeing, and inter-cultural relations. A major goal in the new phase of the project will be to clarify and promote the conceptual and practical (economic, political, social) impacts beyond academe that have been and will be generated by research in the fields of History and Culture.

Drawing on networks and partnerships established since 2006, and developing new ones, the first pathway aims to create sustainable knowledge exchange relationships with public, private and third-sector organisations through both collaborative events and, where feasible, internships and placements. Efforts will be made to demonstrate the mutual benefits of interaction and exchange between researchers and external partners. In order to achieve enhanced impacts, the project will disseminate the knowledge produced by leading edge research beyond academic institutions and environments, whilst giving researchers increased access to the knowledge, perspectives and feedback of user organisations. The second pathway centres on international research networks and exchanges, through which the numerous international contacts and partnerships at CEELBAS universities will be developed to enable UK and international researchers to collaborate and share expertise, including in areas of knowledge exchange and user engagement. This aims to raise the international profile and connectedness of UK research, helping to create a vibrant research environment in which different insights and approaches are shared and applied across borders. The third pathway aims to build capacity in research and language skills training networks for postgraduates. This includes training for knowledge exchange, public and media engagement, and interaction with non-academic audiences. Building on successful CEELBAS training initiatives developed since 2006, this pathway seeks to put in place the resources and infrastructure to deliver sustainable, cost-effective and innovative provision in advanced language and research skills.

The pathway activities aim to develop a template for best practice that will be applicable beyond the East European area studies research community (and its users), particularly, for example, in supporting future LBAS development for other regions, such as South Asia and Latin America. More broadly, CEELBAS aims to show innovation and leadership in promoting research excellence and knowledge exchange, and in providing training and career opportunities for postgraduate and early-career researchers. This will help to ensure that Humanities and language-based expertise at UK universities continues to play a central role in addressing issues of strategic national importance and in advancing international cooperation and intercultural communication and exchange.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The three pathways are designed to enhance impact by providing business, public policy and third sector communities with new insights into the CEELBAS region and strategic themes, and with enhanced access to the expertise and language skills of academic researchers. Inter-regional perspectives and inter-Centre collaboration will be encouraged to demonstrate the wider strategic and national importance of Language-Based Area Studies in an inter-connected world.

Established CEELBAS Phase 1 contacts within user communities will be enhanced, particularly through increased international collaboration. The three development pathways aim to achieve extensive and lasting impacts by providing a sustainable framework for interaction between academics and a variety of non-academic users. Targeted user-groups will comprise business and consultancy firms (e.g. Control Risks, Chambers of Commerce, EBRD); charities and NGOs (e.g. BEARR Trust, Transparency International UK, Oxfam); policy institutes (e.g. Chatham House); media organisations (e.g. BBC World Service, Radio Free Europe, Russian Media House); museums, libraries and cultural organisations (e.g. British Library, British Council, Pushkin House, Polish Cultural Association); embassies and government departments (e.g. FCO).

Internship and placement schemes will promote the policy-relevance of CEELBAS research. Interns working on projects in BBC Monitoring, for example, would work with BBC staff to produce reports for BBC Monitoring customers, such as the FCO, MOD and other government departments. As a consequence, practitioners will benefit from the skills and conceptual understanding of CEELBAS researchers. Knowledge Exchange events will be designed in a practical manner to demonstrate to audiences drawn from business and/or policymaking communities the impacts that have been and can be generated by deep knowledge of the historical and cultural dynamics of the region. Such events will also demonstrate the added value of language expertise in addressing the various social, economic, political and strategic challenges, as well as the opportunities for more effective trade, business development and cultural exchange, that frame the UK's relationship with Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Eurasia.

The strategic themes now prioritised by CEELBAS encompass areas such as transnationalism and cultural exchange, migration and diaspora studies, the political and social role of science, new media and non-textual modes of communication, the regional impact of global economic and political developments, and comparative studies of health and wellbeing. Such themes aim to demonstrate how the Humanities (including languages) fit into the interdisciplinary CEELBAS research agenda and how the project will promote collaboration between humanities-based scholars and social scientists. This will add significantly to the impact and strategic importance of CEELBAS. 

The Knowledge Exchange initiatives to be pursued by CEELBAS in Phase 2 are intended to achieve impact both in the immediate term through workshops and project collaboration and in the longer term through training and development. The postgraduate training pathway, for example, will achieve non-academic impacts by orienting highly skilled young researchers to the needs of user communities. By embedding Knowledge Exchange in the training programme and developing capabilities in so-called 'strategically-important but vulnerable' languages, this pathway will help to ensure a sustainable flow of expertise for the academic and non-academic communities alike. CEELBAS language development projects (e.g. in creating corpora for strategic research) will be of interest to specialist language providers in government and other organisations and will help to address the national deficit in language skills in UK education and research by equipping postgraduates with vital transferable skills on an efficient, shared basis.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>410942</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>openDemocracy.net</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Editorial and internship partnership with oD Russia</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F9616F3-9A80-479A-8C87-1CBF7E7A5E02</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A total of 9 articles were published in the first series (2013).

The results of the discussion were subsequently presented at the Balassi Institute for Hungarian Studies conference in August 2013 and in an interview broadcast on the Hungarian radio station MR1-Kossuth Radio.

The event involved the participation of five publishing houses (Arc, Stork Presss, Francis Boutle, Istros Books, Jantar Publishing) which focus on literature (prose and poetry) in translation from less-widely used languages. Both publishers and academics showed an interest in a similar workshop in the future at the end of the event.

As well as enabling postgraduate researchers to work with think tanks, the media and cultural organisations in the UK (oD Russia, Project for Democratic Union, Calvert 22, GRAD Gallery), the internship scheme promoted several collaborations with international partners. Host organisations have included regional think tanks, museums, libraries, galleries and NGOs in Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Ukraine and the USA. To promote this model of knowledge exchange, and to showcase some of its outcomes and impacts, a 'show and tell' workshop was held at Wolfson College, Oxford (5 February 2015). The event was attended by over 20 research students and included useful feedback from editorial staff at oD Russia, who outlined the benefits of the scheme from a host organisation's perspective (http://www.ceelbas.ac.uk/ceelbas-news/events/workshops/internships-event).

Below are listed some specific examples of how CEELBAS interns have contributed to the five social, cultural and media organisations.

? Cambridge student Molly Flynn had an internship at GRAD Gallery, working on a press and marketing strategy for a performance event. It involved expanding the performance programme 'Peripheral Visions' to include a series of three different performances of Eastern European documentary theatre projects that ran from mid-October to mid-November. The host organisation wanted to enrich their programme through Molly's considerable knowledge and cultural contacts. Molly's excellent organisational skills and knowledge of contemporary theatre contributed significantly to the success of the project. The 'Peripheral Visions' documentary theatre programme will be featured in a number of high profile news publications. 
Molly contributed to raising GRAD's profile by securing significant press coverage. 

? During her internship in the National Museum in Warsaw Katarzyna Jezowska assisted the curatorial team with various works connected with the presentation. She also participated in daily activities concerning the Modern Design Centre's Archives. Katarzyna was cataloguing and organising data related to Polish designers whose works are in the Museum's collection. Katarzyna's work connected with organising database of Modern Design Centre will help the museum team and external researchers to use the archive.
? Sam Goff had his internship in Calvert 22 Foundation. In addition to occasional editorial work, he wrote a number of excellent feature articles and news pieces for The Calvert Journal, and prepared two presentations for the editorial team. One of his articles was republished by The Guardian. He also did extensive research for Red Africa, a season of exhibitions and events to be held at Calvert 22 in 2016. The Calvert Journal's Deputy Editor emphasized the quality of Sam's work and his research skills and the quality of the articles submitted. As the result of this internship, Calvert Foundation is interested in further cooperation with CEELBAS and as CEELBAS comes to an end, there are negotiations in process for Calvert to become CEELBAS's CDT external partner which will mean that Calvert will offer more studentships and training for CEELBAS CDT research students. 

In addition to the Internship Scheme and the events and activities covered by previous reports, LBAS Development Funding has promoted dialogue between academic researchers and experts from outside the HE sector through:

? a workshop convened to address Russian and Ukrainian journalistic practices, cultural identities and issues of governance at the regional level: Russia and Ukraine: Spotlight on the regions (UCL, 2 June 2015) - attended by over 40 delegates, including journalists and representatives from BBC Monitoring, the EBRD, the BEARR Trust, Oxford Analytica, and the Foreign Policy Centre (http://www.ceelbas.ac.uk/ceelbas-news/events/workshops/regions);

? a debate hosted by Pushkin House: The future of independent media in Russia (April 1st 2015) was fully-subscribed and had over 70 delegates, including CEELBAS doctoral and early-career researchers, UK and Russian journalists and editors, and a diverse 'general public' audience (http://www.ceelbas.ac.uk/ceelbas-news/events/russian-media). 

In the reporting period, CEELBAS continued to play a key role in the development of distance learning courses and e-learning materials for the study of Slavonic and East European languages: http://www.ceelbas.ac.uk/research/language/completed
The open-access CEELBAS Language Repository is now home to over 70 different sets of teaching materials, guides and reports. The Repository will continue to be maintained by UCL as an important national resource and the link to Repository was also placed to a newly created CEELBAS CDT website, thus valuable language sources will be accessible by a wider audience. 

CEELBAS has provided travel bursaries and event-management support for the successful student-led Platform Ukraine initiative at UCL - a year-long long project to analyse the Ukraine crisis of 2014 in comparative and multi-/inter-disciplinary perspective (http://www.platformukraine.com/). CEELBAS support has helped, in particular, to publicise the project to both academic and user communities outside UCL. Feedback received by the project coordinators has highlighted the value of the inclusion of practitioners from industry and civil society organisations, as well as the participation of academics from institutions in Europe, North America and Australia.

More broadly, CEELBAS internships and the Centre's other postgraduate and early-career training initiatives have played an important capacity-building role in supporting - both directly and indirectly - the professional and career development of the next generation of academic researchers and other professional experts. The Mid-Term Review (February 2015) gave the examples of Tom Rowley (a University of Cambridge PhD who is now Associate Editor at oD Russia) and Teresa Wigglesworth-Baker (a University of Sheffield PhD who has since worked as an expert for the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities). Several other researchers who benefitted from CEELBAS support during the LBAS Development Funding period have since gone to positions in NGOs and cultural organisations (e.g. Forum 18 News Service, Wroclaw College of Eastern Europe, GRAD Gallery London) and in the HE sector. Examples of the latter include: Ilya Yablokov (University of Leeds); Dina Gusejnova (QMUL); Muireann Maguire (University of Exeter); Katherine Bowers (University of British Columbia); Tauri Tuvikene (Tallinn University).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9845E17F-CABF-4905-B299-8F17910D6285</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The award resulted in a range of achievements across the LBAS development funding pathways. The CEELBAS Internship Scheme has delivered impressive examples of collaboration between doctoral researchers and non-HEI partners, many interns were highly praised by the representatives of host organisations as their knowledge, professional skills and efficiency were valuable for the running of organisations (17 research internships outside the HE sector). CEELBAS kept providing an effective model for knowledge exchange (2 workshops to promote dialogue between academic researchers and experts from outside the HE sector, 1 workshop to promote the model of knowledge exchange). New research networks continue to emerge, connecting scholars across CEELBAS institutions, across LBAS Centres, and beyond (15 research network workshops). Recent International Research Visits (IRVs) have facilitated both the dissemination and/or refinement of ongoing research and set the basis for longer-term collaboration between CEELBAS universities and international ROs (10 international research visits). New initiatives with the FCO and the British Library, as well as impressive student-driven conferences and workshops, have enhanced the interdisciplinary research training environment at CEELBAS universities. Close liaison with the CEELBAS AHRC Centre for Doctoral Training ensured continued innovation and responsiveness to student training needs. CEELBAS has also been central to the development of new resources and expertise for e-learning in Slavonic and East European languages (6 new distance learning language courses, 21 research training bursaries, an online guide providing essential information for using over 30 archives and research libraries in Russia and Ukraine, 1 media training workshop, 3 study days at the British Library, 1 professional development training workshop).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The projects, events and activities supported by CEELBAS through LBAS Development Funding will continue to bear fruit over the years ahead through planned research outputs and further collaborations. A recent example from LBAS Development Funding Phase 1 (2012-14) is a special issue of Science Fiction Film and Television (Issue 2, Vol. 8, June 2015) featuring outputs from the joint CEELBAS-CRCEES network workshop 'Far Rainbows: Russian and Soviet Science Fiction on Screen' (April 2013). In 2016, forthcoming special issues of the journals Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society, Europe-Asia Studies and the Journal of Design History all have their origins in CEELBAS research network workshops; other outputs based on CEELBAS-supported events are also planned (e.g. on Russian Biography and Russian and Soviet Film Studies). 

An example of the longer-term projects that have been initiated by CEELBAS research networking events is the ongoing collaboration between scholars at the Cambridge Courtauld Russian Art Centre (CCRAC) and international ROs, curators and museum directors. Following two CEELBAS-supported symposia on Russian-British artistic relations (December 2014 and January 2015), CCRAC has developed close ties with the Director of the Polenovo State Museum Reserve, as well as with experts at Yaroslavl University, with whom future joint conferences are being planned.

CEELBAS support for research networking events has also helped to promote interest in its subject area amongst undergraduate and postgraduate students. 
Experience to date suggests that doctoral and early-career researchers will continue to benefit from new knowledge exchange opportunities developed through the CEELBAS internship scheme. For example, following an internship with the Project for Democratic Union (October 2014-February 2015), Vsevolod Samokhvalov (University of Cambridge) has participated in two colloquia in the Houses of Parliament and contributed to a collaborative report on EU foreign and security policy. Similarly, Natasha Wunsch (UCL) has written a policy study on the EU accession process in the Balkans for the German Council on Foreign Relations, in which she expands on insights gained through two CEELBAS internship projects with think-tanks in the region: https://dgap.org/en/think-tank/publications/dgapanalysis/right-goals-wrong-tools.

The CEELBAS AHRC CDT is already benefiting from the model for knowledge exchange that the Internship Scheme has developed. Indeed, one current CDT award holder - Daria Mattingly (University of Cambridge) - has already completed an internship supported under the LBAS Development Funding grant.

More broadly, CEELBAS internships and the Centre's other postgraduate and early-career training initiatives have played an important capacity-building role in supporting - both directly and indirectly - the professional and career development of the next generation of academic researchers and other professional experts. The Mid-Term Review (February 2015) gave the examples of Tom Rowley (a University of Cambridge PhD who is now Associate Editor at oD Russia) and Teresa Wigglesworth-Baker (a University of Sheffield PhD who has since worked as an expert for the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities). Several other researchers who benefitted from CEELBAS support during the LBAS Development Funding period have since gone to positions in NGOs and cultural organisations (e.g. Forum 18 News Service, Wroclaw College of Eastern Europe, GRAD Gallery London) and in the HE sector. Examples of the latter include: Ilya Yablokov (University of Leeds); Dina Gusejnova (QMUL); Muireann Maguire (University of Exeter); Katherine Bowers (University of British Columbia); Tauri Tuvikene (Tallinn University).

The AHRC CDT also provides a platform through which to sustain the fruitful CEELBAS partnership with oD Russia. The involvement of oDR editorial staff in CDT media training workshops and other events will help to strengthen contacts between Open Democracy and the Russian &amp;amp; East European Studies academic community, and this will serve to further promote the oDR website as a platform for the wider dissemination of academic research. The oDR partnership is another experience that will inform CEELBAS contributions to the two collaborative AHRC Public Policy Engagement Skills Training projects mentioned above.

The open-access CEELBAS Language Repository is now home to over 70 different sets of teaching materials, guides and reports. The Repository will continue to be maintained by UCL as an important national resource and the link to Repository was also placed to a newly created CEELBAS CDT website, thus valuable language sources will be accessible by a wider audience. The skills and experience gained by language teachers through the delivery of CEELBAS materials development and e-learning projects will also be critical to ongoing efforts to sustain national provision in these 'strategically important but vulnerable' languages. In addition, through CEELBAS training workshops, language teachers have helped to equip the Slavonic &amp;amp; East European postgraduate and early-career research community with a practical understanding of how to tackle the challenges of teaching the region's languages at HE level. 

Other web-based resources that will be maintained by CEELBAS for the longer-term include a Database of Expertise and a Guide to Russian &amp;amp; Ukrainian Archives (see above), as well as an extensive set of workshop reports, research guides and podcasts. 

As previous reports have stated, CEELBAS has been complemented by a number of on-going institutional initiatives in support of Russian and East European Studies. In addition to the institutional matched funding for the CEELBAS CDT, these include: the UCL Mellon Programme (dedicated to conceptualising the role of Humanities in interdisciplinary Area Studies); the investment of UCL SSEES in distance learning for UG and PG language courses; the Cambridge Committee for Russian and East European Studies (CamCREES) and the Cambridge Central Asian Network; the new programmes in Polish Studies at the University of Cambridge (launched October 2014) and the University of Oxford (launched July 2013); and the Global Europe Centre at the University of Kent. Russian &amp;amp; East European Studies researchers will also continue to benefit from significant support and training through cross-disciplinary programmes such as the University of Manchester's artsmethods@manchester and the University of Sheffield's Humanities Research Institute.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B505D7EC-786B-44F3-BBB5-66714997F374</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ceelbas.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Language teaching and self-study resources created through CEELBAS Language Projects.</gtr:description><gtr:id>77FA3D49-6B36-4552-9E21-96F034C236F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The resource has created bespoke materials for less-widely taught languages, all of which are available through an open access Creative Commons license.
