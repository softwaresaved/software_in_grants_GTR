The opposite is also true however, as urban renewal, major infrastructure and monumental architectural projects are all invested by planners and policy-makers with the expectation that they will redeem depressed areas and renew the social and physical fabric of neighbourhoods and communities: again, this also applies to the past. Though firmly based in the context and experience of Early Modern Europe, this project set out to view the process of urban change as witnessed along streets, with a comparative perspective offered by contemporary practice and experience. In relation to the public space of streets, we have considered these major themes: the relation between ephemeral performances and permanent urban change; the performative siting of violence, punishment and protest; surveillance, policing and control; gossip and the circulation of news; street sounds. The network set out to bring an historical understanding of contemporary problems concerning street culture, by addressing issues that may help reframe current issues, thus feeding into public policy (a follow-on-funding award expressly addresses this). This objective has also been advanced by the network's varied constituencies and the involvement of our project partners, CABE (Commission for Architecture and Built Environment). 

The network has created a vibrant research community that is looking at new methodologies by bringing together historians, art historians, architectural historians, cultural anthropologists, social geographers, architects, urban planners, performers and artists, to discuss the social and physical environment of the street in a cross-disciplinary manner and across a broad chronological sweep.

The Street life and street culture network has met seven times over a two year period. The place and form of the meetings has varied. The first event was held Oxford, using an 'Open Space' approach where the network team brought together a number of participants from cultural anthropology, the professions of architecture and planning, and local community services, as well as actors, artists and an author. The objective was to explore shared interests and agendas that informed our subsequent activities. We subsequently held two workshops, and a session at an international conference which brought in additional outside speakers; these addressed such themes as the temporary and ephemeral use of urban space, violence/conflict/control, and gossip/information/sound. The network team also held an overseas meeting in central Italy, which explored various aspects of the performative nature of urban space. We also held a final conference in London will present our findings with a broad range of speakers and respondents, to showcase our activity over 2 years.

The network PI is Fabrizio Nevola (University of Bath), whose previous work on Early Modern Siena (Siena: Constructing the Renaissance City, New Haven and London 2007 and co-author of the exhibition catalogue of the National Gallery's recent Renaissance Siena: Art for a City) is characterised by an interdisciplinary approach to the urban environment. Related to the network's activity, his new book project is entitled 'Street Life in Renaissance Italy' (contract from Yale UP). CI for the project is Georgia Clarke (Courtauld Institute of Art, London), author of Roman House - Renaissance Palaces. Inventing Antiquity in Fifteenth-Century Italy (Cambridge University Press, 2003).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>42834</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Research form this project fed into a further funded piece of work (AH/K005138/1) which created a public-facing smartphone app.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0100713B-06BB-4808-865D-85BFCD50B936</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Street life and street culture network has set out to build an international team of scholars with shared research interests in the interdisciplinary study of urban culture; in particular the relationship between the built environment and the social fabric of Early Modern and contemporary cities. The result has been a dynamic discourse between specialists from historical and non-historical disciplines that has linked the historic past to the present. Indeed, since the public urban life of the pre-Modern Mediterranean world has frequently been held up as a model for the socially engaged, publicly-staged idea of community, we have also aimed to test the potential for such cross-chronological comparisons. While textual evidence is a crucial tool for the historian, the environment of the street (visual, aural, theatrical, architectural, political) has been the principal object of our study, and as such is 'beyond text'.
This was a network, and the prime focus of our activity has been to initiate the creation and consolidation of a core research group. We accomplished this through a series of events over a period of 2 years, details of which can be found on the network website (www.bath.ac.uk/ace/Streetlife/). In some respects, the most important finding of our network is that there is considerable scope for useful cross-chronological and interdisciplinary research on the network's theme. Since a concern of the original AHRC reviewers had been that &amp;quot;it would be a fortunate accident rather than a predictable outcome&amp;quot; that a fruitful dialogue might be set up between scholars and practitioners from Early Modern and contemporary fields, it is worth underlining that this has been achieved from the outset. Feedback from our study days and conference - from audience and participants - repeatedly underlined enthusiasm, interest and positive comments on the innovative and successful nature of this cross-chronological dialogue. It should be underlined that CI and PI worked very hard to ensure the selection of open-minded and creative contributors for the network events, which thus enabled the goal of a fruitful discussion on selected themes to work effectively.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The follow-on-funding was for continuation of network activity, and as such the aim was to extend the range of our participant base and engage directly with policy/practice participants. We have achieved this successfully, bringing in participants from town planning design and policymaking, think tanks, public bodies, the police force and related policy research agencies, charitable foundations and trusts involved in research, policy and practice pertaining to public space.

One collaboration that has grown from the original project-partnership of the network with CABE has fed through in the form of continued discussion and collaboration with participants from the Greater London Authority and the Centre for Cities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E8882C2C-F79A-4853-87A5-38B744A47475</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/ace/Streetlife/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G000417/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>2BC7804C-63E1-4BF8-9DBD-A79F62106DAF</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/G000417/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>49963.0</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2009-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>6071717E-8B02-4731-8EB4-C21D9852802C</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/G000417/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>42834.78</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
