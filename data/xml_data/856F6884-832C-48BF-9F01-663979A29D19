&lt;p>This project will develop a template which will be a practical tool to help policymakers in their deliberations around social values in health priority setting.&amp;nbsp;The template will set out the relevant social values and the range of ways in which they can be interpreted, in an intellectually coherent yet practical and accessible way.&amp;nbsp;It aims to be easily adaptable to local circumstances, and to offer a means by which policymakers can more easily identify, articulate and address issues of social values in their decisions. It will enable clearer identification of the values and their social and ethical implications and, as such, will help policymakers to reason more cogently in their deliberations and, ultimately, to render their decisions more socially justifiable.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will have policy impact both in the process of developing the template as well as via the finished template itself. It is envisaged this will occur in the following ways. 

1. User involvement
User involvement is central to the work of developing the template. We envisage that colleagues in our network of health policy makers will gain much learning as a result of their involvement with the project, both from us as researchers as well as from fellow practitioners, as a result of the network that will be strengthened and extended, and which will provide (and already is starting to provide) a contact point for policy makers from around the world in this area. We fully expect this network and the relationships forged within it to extend beyond the life of the proposed research project, thus providing long term impact. 
 

2.Interactive web-based resource

A web-based resource will be developed as a site where policy makers can upload their examples of priority setting decisions and decision-making processes. Practitioners will be able to download all of the case studies submitted and there will be an interactive forum where they can leave comments, share information and knowledge, and debate issues with fellow policy-makers. 

Both the developing template and associated research findings arising from analysis of the policy examples will be posted on the site, and users invited to comment on them on an ongoing basis. Whilst this will, we hope, contribute to policy maker's thinking and practice on the issues, it will also be an important way of testing the template in the course of its development. 


3. Workshop at Health Technology Assessment international conference Bilbao 2012

This will be an opportunity for all members of the network to meet and discuss the template and the research so far, and for us to disseminate our research findings amongst policy makers who may not yet be part of the network. As such, we envisage it will provide a chance to widen the network and to publicise the research project still further, bringing more interested users into the network. 


4. The template 

Whilst the process of developing the template will provide opportunities for ongoing impact from the beginning of the project as outlined above, the template itself will be a vehicle for long term impact. It will be a tool which can be used by policy makers in many different national contexts to help promote their understanding of social values in health decision making, to enable them to identify when those values are in play, to guide them in negotiating some of the difficult challenges they present, and so ultimately to improve the quality of priority setting decisions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78257</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The framework developed in the project has been converted into a social values audit tool that is currently being applied and developed as part of a London Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) project, run by Professor Peter Littlejohns of KCL Medical School. The intention is that it be applied internally by and externally to decision-making organisations such as CCGs for improved transparency. 

In addition the group serviced by the award continues to be active in making submissions to consultations, most notably the recent NHS England/NICE consultation on proposals for changes to the arrangements for evaluating and funding drugs and other health technologies appraised through NICE's technology appraisal and highly specialised technologies programmes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>23AACDDB-26A0-4DB1-B7D6-322C0C9C6C51</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The object of the award was not to conduct further research but to see whether the general approach developed by modern social contract theory could be applied to a specific area of policy. However, the key insight from the research is that social values, other than benefit maximization, play an important role in determining a justifiable and politically accountable allocation of health care resources. This is set out in various publications associated with the award.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am continuing to collaborate with Professor Peter Littlejohns in on-going work to extend to a wide range of health care commissioners the use of the template.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6050AEEC-C0CC-47D4-B049-FC90C2B16A16</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/socialvalues</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/72D37C2D-EA8B-41D6-90BD-E208D9BB26D8"><gtr:id>72D37C2D-EA8B-41D6-90BD-E208D9BB26D8</gtr:id><gtr:title>To Whom Will GP Commissioners Answer?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Pulse</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/02819fab1c764912d6ebecd1d06d61a0"><gtr:id>02819fab1c764912d6ebecd1d06d61a0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Weale A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BCA5941C-7C0B-43A4-A44B-401D302B07F3"><gtr:id>BCA5941C-7C0B-43A4-A44B-401D302B07F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Written evidence from Professor Peter Littlejohns and Professor Albert Weale (NICE 13)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/61c9768e681dbeb3b7b97e9ca1e72d09"><gtr:id>61c9768e681dbeb3b7b97e9ca1e72d09</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Littlejohns P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2F3EF69C-2307-4E15-8096-E60B84010244"><gtr:id>2F3EF69C-2307-4E15-8096-E60B84010244</gtr:id><gtr:title>Justifying Healthcare Priority Will Not Be Easy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health Services Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/61c9768e681dbeb3b7b97e9ca1e72d09"><gtr:id>61c9768e681dbeb3b7b97e9ca1e72d09</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Littlejohns P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J011061/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
