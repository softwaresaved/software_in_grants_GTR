This link between early brain development and behavioural patterns later in life can contribute directly to our thinking about education, social policy and clinical practice. Specifically, by measuring how a young baby processes information it may be possible to discover more about the origin of developmental disorders such as Autism. Techniques which are currently used to investigate brain development in young infants (i.e. less than 12 months old) are limited for a number of practical, ethical and technical reasons. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an inexpensive optical technique which uses low levels of light to measure the distribution of oxygen and blood in the brain. The equipment is safe, portable and well suited to measurements in young infants (it is routinely used to monitor premature infants). Recent developments have led to the development of a system which can produce two dimensional maps of blood distribution which can be used to determine which areas of the brain are processing information. The aim of this proposal is to use this NIRS mapping system to determine whether specific regions of the brain are active over the first few months of life. Studies will be performed on healthy infants aged 4 and 12 months using behavioural tasks designed to stimulate the frontal and prefrontal cortex, and provide information about how babies process information about their physical world. These experiments are designed to be enjoyable for the babies to ensure their interest is maintained for the duration of the study. Some technical developments will be required to produce an effective method of fitting the optical probes to the infant head and to detect whether the infant is moving during the study. As well as providing essential information about the development of the healthy brain, this work will contribute directly to the studies in the future of infants with developmental disorders. 
Both groups have a proven track record of communicating their science to a wide audience through the media, public lectures and school events. As a female physicist, the Principle Investigator is often called upon as a role model for young people contemplating careers in science and enjoys using these opportunities to promote interest in her research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The work described in this proposal provides a unique opportunity for a multidisciplinary collaboration between internationally renowned groups to combine their extensive expertise in developmental cognitive neuroscience and non invasive functional imaging, with the aim of characterising functional brain development in the young infant. The investigation of the prefrontal cortex is of relevance to several developmental disorders, including Autism. It has been suggested that the frontal, and particularly pre-frontal cortical regions do not become active until after the first year of life. Experimental confirmation of this has been difficult due to the ethical, technical and practical limitations of the techniques that have been used to investigate functional activation in young infants. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non invasive optical technique which has been used to measure the haemodynamic response to cortical activation in both adults and newborn infants. Recent technical developments have led to optical topography systems capable of providing two dimensional maps of cortical haemodynamics and oxygenation. The aim of this study is to use an NIR topography system to examine the extent of frontal and prefrontal activity in young infants. A customised optical helmet (incorporating a motion sensor) will be designed for making optical topography measurements on infants of four and twelve months of age. The helmet design will be informed by mathematical modelling of light transport in the infant head which will be verified by laboratory based studies using tissue-like optical phantoms. A total of 120 infants, aged four and twelve months, will be studied using two behavioural tasks; Anticipatory Looking and Selective Inhibition. In the Anticipatory Looking task the infants? fixation and saccades during the presentation of cartoon stimuli in different locations will be analysed from video and eye tracker data and classified as ?reactive? and ?anticipatory?. The Selective Inhibition task will be designed to detect prefrontal activation related to response inhibition for interesting and repetitive animations presented with and without peripheral targets. The localised NIRS data will be matched to the fixation and saccades data to confirm the presence/absence/distribution of activation of prefrontal regions. Analysis software will be developed to produce real time maps of changes in oxyhaemoglobin and dexoyhaemoglobin concentration, which as part of a longer term aim, will be used to match haemodynamic responses to those measured using event related potentials. This work will be directly applicable to other members of our Co-Op in longitudinal studies on the development of brain function.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>209703</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department of Space and Climate Physics (MSSL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for Space Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Centre for Space Medicine UCL</gtr:description><gtr:id>82403599-8729-4F4A-9076-C1AE1C6B9F76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Funding application submitted Nov 2012.
