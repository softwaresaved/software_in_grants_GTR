One sociolinguist has even warned of a 'sociologically innocent and ignorant generation of sociolinguists'. \n\nWith around 30% of UK research now having a sociolinguistic focus, the consequences of this ignorance for French linguistics are alarming. Firstly, sociolinguists who attempt to study the interaction between language and societal factors (e.g. age, social class) are often hamstrung by outdated methodology which takes too little account of recent methodological developments in sociology, anthropology, and geography and consequently lacks the sophistication necessary for reliable results on the social dimension. Secondly, sociolinguists can be accused of failing to understand changes in French society since the so-called 'Trente Glorieuses' (1945-75), an era of unprecedented economic growth buttressed by heavy public-sector investment. During this period urbanisation doubled, the presence of racially diverse migrants increased considerably, gender parity began to be taken seriously and real upward mobility for many became possible. The less favourable economic conditions of its aftermath, and the emergent post-industrial society and concomitant 'medianisation' of social classes resulted in linguistic changes which might be described as 'levelling'. But as Hornsby (2006) has argued, the received view that levelling implies inevitable homogenization has meant that new forms of variation in France's burgeoning urban centres have been largely ignored, as sociolinguists have explored either (as in the case of the Phonologie du fran&amp;ccedil;ais contemporain ('Contemporary French Phonology') project: PFC) remote, linguistically divergent sites (e.g. Gu&amp;eacute;zennec 2003) or deprived multi-ethnic banlieues on the oskirts of major cities (e.g. Jamin 2005). Much other work has focused on perceptions rather than behaviour (e.g. Bulot 2008) or on the now revalorised regional languages. While the PFC project among others has provided useful linguistic data, there has been limited application of sociolinguistic methodologies and even more limited consideration of sociological background. \n\nThe proposed research network seeks to remedy this unhealthy division of labour by bringing together sociolinguists, sociologists, social anthropologists and geographers to debate possible methodological interfaces. The desired research outcomes are twofold. First, by examining the different models of analysis used for sociolinguistic and sociological research both in France and in the Anglo-Saxon world, a better understanding of the rapidly transforming French social landscape can be achieved. For sociolinguists, this will mean the development of models which are, at last, properly informed by contemporary sociology and applied to the specific conditions of francophone (rather than north American or anglophone) society. At the same time, this network will facilitate the use of findings and models developed for the study of language to challenge and refine existing sociological practice. These would include the relationship between linguistic and non-linguistic conceptions of identity, language as an 'objective' and 'subjective' dimension of class, and the characteristics of urban networks, all of which will provide social scientists working on contemporary France with new insights and perspectives to inform their own research agendas. In order to provide a precise focus for this debate, two one-day workshops and an interdisciplinary conference will explore questions which interface sociolinguistic and sociological issues in the French context: i) class, ii) urbanization and social structure ana iii) the self and 'other' within a globalizing community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Language is not merely a form of social activity: it is also a powerful mediator of social difference. By bringing together expertise in sociology, sociolinguistics, social geography and anthropology, and thereby refining our understanding of how the complex relationship between language and society works in the French context, we hope to contribute to improvements in public policy in three key areas:\n\nLanguage and Education: the relationship between group identity and language variation has important implications for acquisition of the standard language, and its associated advantages. A better understanding of how language use entrenches disadvantage will inform educational policies geared to the promotion of social mobility. \n\nIntegration, Globalization and Identity: a better understanding of how language shapes society and reflects its internal divisions (for example as a notable determinant of what is commonly understood by 'class') can usefully contribute to improving policies aimed at promoting social cohesion, notably by facilitating communication between service providers and marginal or hard to reach groups.\n\nCultural and Linguistic Heritage: notably absent from public debates around the protection of minority languages is any close analysis of the extent to and the manner in which such varieties are relevant to speakers themselves. Such considerations are important, for example, in the context of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, to which the UK - but not France - is currently a signatory.\n\nFindings from collaborative academic research are typically disseminated within the academic community via research presentations, working papers, conferences and learned publication, and as a consequence may take time to reach a wider non-specialist audience. To facilitate dissemination of relevant conclusions to those outside the academic world who may benefit from them, we propose three principal additional channels:\n\nWebsite: a website will be set up and maintained during the project to report findings in an accessible way and encourage dialogue with project members\n\nCommunications Offices: specialist staff at the media and communications offices of Kent and Cambridge Universities will assist researchers in preparing press releases to regional, national and international media\n\nRegional Workshop: a one-day regional workshop in Canterbury, organized via the University of Kent Partnerships Development Office, will present findings informally to a wider audience which will include invited specialists contacted through previous and ongoing EU Interreg initiatives. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35352</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Language and Social Structure in Urban France</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>65DB8990-2752-43D4-897A-42149718597B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A website has been set up, giving details of the Research Network, the Steering Committee and the contributors.
