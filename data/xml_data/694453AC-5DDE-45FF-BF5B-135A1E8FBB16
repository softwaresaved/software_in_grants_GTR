In India, for example, annual imports of edible oil are a staggering 50% of the national consumption, costing of over &amp;pound; 3.6 billion. The national average dietary intake of fat/oil in India is 9kg/person/year (kpy). In rural India, the intake is 1-7 kpy, which is well below the minimum nutritional recommendation of 14 kpy.
 White blister rust caused by the oomycete Albugo candida is one of the most important diseases of oilseed mustard and other vegetable brassicas globally. The pathogen can infect all above-ground parts of the plant, but causes the most severe damage as systemic infections of the inflorescence leading to staghead formation. The disease causes yield losses in oilseed mustard of 20-60% in India, Canada and Australia. With the development of canola quality B. juncea, many countries like Australia and Canada are growing B. juncea more extensively as a crop that is better suited for areas with low rainfall than oilseed rape. However, white rust susceptibility is a major concern, so development of new B. juncea varieties that combine durable white rust resistance and drought tolerance is needed to improve productivity in south Asia and to expand global production of this important oilseed crop.
 The integrated use of pathology and molecular genetics can provide an evidence-based strategy for assembling gene combinations around specific broad spectrum R-genes, and ultimately achieve sustainable disease control via anticipatory breeding of new resistant crop cultivars. This strategy is theoretically possible in any crop, including Indian mustard. However, molecular identification of matching host and pathogen determinants (R and AVR genes, respectively) are rate-limiting but nevertheless required to enable whole-genome selection of optimal gene combinations along with other essential traits.
 The proposed Indo-UK partnership has unique opportunity to lead in this research of global importance to food security. This will be achieved by harnessing genomics and bioinformatics tools to extend the on-going efforts towards anticipatory breeding of disease resistance, for sustainable control of white rust in brassicas, and specifically for development of B. juncea varieties that will be adapted for cultivation in India. To date, deployment of the state-of-art genomic approaches for combating white blister rust has been minimal in India and the UK. Similarly, efforts have not yet been initiated to characterize the genome level diversity of the pathogen population. The proposed project is therefore a major opportunity to establish coordinated capability in the genomic characterization of both host and pathogen, which will extend the approaches currently being used in India towards more effective breeding and disease management strategies.
Primary outputs will be aimed at efficient identification of genes that control white blister rust in brassicas. To achieve this, three project objectives will exploit examples of white rust resistance that have already been identified in primary and secondary gene pools, and in the wild relative Arabidopsis thaliana, to enable precise genotyping of resistance in seedlings for marker-assisted breeding of R-gene combinations, and to evaluate transgenic methods for developing sustainable white rust control in B. juncea cultivars of Indian mustard. 
 A complementary pathology aim will advance capability of using pathogen-based information for evaluating the potential durability of targeted disease resistance genes in optimal combinations for use in Indian mustard varieties of B. juncea. Two project objectives will capitalise on the latest genomic resources available in Albugo, to define the pathotype variability of A. candida in India and to assess the potential emergence of variants that could overcome individual white rust resistance genes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>White blister rust (Albugo candida) is one of the most important diseases of oilseed mustard.

Oilseed crops are important for the economy and health of people living in throughout south Asia, as a multi-purpose crop including seeds for edible oil, leaves as a vegetable and for animal fodder, and the dried stems as domestic biofuel. Rapeseed-mustard crops comprise more than one third of the home-grown vegetable oil production in India and covers around 7.0 million hectares. B. juncea occupies more than 80% of this area. Smallholding, resource poor farmers produce most of the crop, and will be direct beneficiaries, with current average seed production of less than 0.4 tonne/ha compared with a yield potential of 2.5-3.0 tons/ha. 
White blister rust is a major disease constraint on production, causing yield losses of at least 20-60% in India, Canada and Australia. Durable disease resistance would improve incomes of smallholding resource poor dry-land farmers, by stabilising mustard yields, and as a consequence boosting rural economy and enhancing nutrition of the poorest people in the Indian subcontinent. Thus, the combined aim of our Indo-UK partnership will be to genetically improve cultivars already adapted for low input production in India, particularly in the rainfed areas, as the duration of the crop is relatively short and has low water requirement compared to other crops. The white rust resistance genes will be introduced into hybrids that have been developed at Delhi University, which will already contain other useful seed quality and yield improvements. Similarly, characterization of white rust resistance will also help research programme in UK dealing with vegetable brassicas, and also with the development of canola quality B. juncea for production in dry regions of Canada and Australia.
 No international institute currently coordinates research on oilseed brassica crops globally. The proposed Indo-UK partnership, however, will assemble a highly complementary team of crop scientists who will build significantly on previous DFID investment in oilseed brassica production in India, and translation of BBSRC and European Research Council investment in pathogen genomics and molecular genetics of disease resistance from Arabidopsis into brassica crops. The research partners will use knowledge gained from their coordinated effort to advance links with existing links with colleagues and research programmes in Canada, Australia and elsewhere in Asia.
 Exchange visits will take place to enable research staff in both countries to develop an active and productive collaboration. This will include UK scientists visiting India in Year 1 for a project meeting and visit to field production sites; and in Year 3 for a knowledge transfer workshop. Indian scientists will visit the UK for training periods, including two PhD students from DU who will each visit for 6 months (one in Year 1 for pathology; and one in Year 2 for gene cloning and pathogen genomics), and two research scientists from AUUP and GBPUAT in Year 1 for pathology. Staff from both India and the UK will also attend the 14th International Rapeseed Congress in Saskatoon, Canada in Year 2, to jointly present results from the Indo-UK partnership to an international audience.
 Knowledge gained from fundamental and strategic science will be published in international refereed journals and disseminated at international and regional conferences. The future translation of this knowledge into breeding programmes will be via the National Agricultural Research Systems of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. This will be facilitated by existing interactions amongst South Asian countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1139576</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Second international conference on Wild Plant Pathosystems</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D8D37F0A-9AF9-414F-8414-F0BD4B3E7D37</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Small gathering of researchers from complementary disciplines of ecology, molecular genetics and pathology, applying research to natural and cultivated systems.

? A group of four candidate resistance genes were mapped in B. oleracea within the first 9 mo of the project, using a combination of two new genotyping technologies (restriction-based genotyping-by-sequencing, and exome-based RenSeq sequencing of disease resistance genes). None of the candidate genes have previously been associated with resistance to an obligate biotroph. Full length sequencing of alleles from both mapping parents indicated polymorphism (a single basepair change affecting an amino acid change) in only one of the four candidate genes. The resistance appears to be recessive, so gene editing (CRISPR-CAS9) will be used to knock-out susceptibility in a transformable accession of B. oleracea. Indian partners will use RNA silencing (preferred technique in their country) to test loss-of-susceptibility (gain of resistance) in B. juncea.
? Given the effectiveness of the new genotyping technologies, a trial was initiated to determine whether white rust resistance genes can be mapped directly from gene bank accessions, without the need for generating a mapping population. Previous work at Warwick had demonstrated that most gene bank accessions are heterogeneous (segregating) for white rust resistance. It should therefore be possible to separate an accession into resistant and susceptible sub-samples, and then use pooled DNA from each sub-sample for bulked segregant mapping of resistance via GBS and/or RenSeq genotyping. The pathology screening has been initiated to generate pools for ca. 10 B. rapa and B. oleracea gene bank accessions.

From the tertiary gene pool:
?Three white rust resistance (WRR) genes have been cloned from A. thaliana and confirmed to confer functional resistance by transformation into B. oleracea and B. juncea. Individual and stacked constructs of these genes have been sent to Indian partners for transgenic testing in an Indian adapted cultivar of B. juncea.

Pathogen genomics:
? A high quality reference genome of A. candida race 2V (from Canada) has been completed, combining paired-end Illumina reads with long-read PacBIO sequences.
? Albugo candida has been identified as an emerging pathogen in the UK for English mustard growers. This is potentially a climate-related disease, which could potentially become a serious threat to English mustard. Two isolates were collected and are being used to screen a diversity collection of B. juncea and B. rapa. Genomic sequence of both isolates have been generated for whole genome comparison with the 2V reference genome.
? An Excel database is being developed called AlbugoSEEK as a decision-support tool for plant breeding. It has been constructed from exile sequencing of effector-like genes from different races of Albugo candida.
? AlbugoSEEK has been used for 'proof-of-concept' to successfully map by association a candidate avirulence effector that matches the broad spectrum R-gene called WRR4 in A. thaliana. Three different pathogen isolates were identified which break WRR4 resistance in the accession Columbia, and all three share mutations in three effectors that are 100% conserved across standard isolates of four races.
* This database was also used as a training tool for Indian partners (Anand Tewari and Pankaj Sharma) in Summer 2016. A effector sequences from a pilot sample of Indian A. candida isolates were added to the database. Comparisons with UK and Canadian isolates provided background insight to plan for adding a more extensive sample of Indian isolates in the final year of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Work is in progress for the Indian partners to take the material and methods forward beyond the duration of the project. Their aim will be field testing of stacked genes from A. thaliana in transgenic B. juncea. This will depend on how quickly they can generate sufficient seed for GM lines. 

Extension of the AlbugoSEEK database is already underway, specifically for brassica crops by initiating reference genome sequencing of Hyaloperonospora brassciae (causing downy mildew and a major co-disease agent in combination with white rust). We have also adapted the concept for bacterial pathogens including Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas of brassica and haricot beans. These tools will be particularly useful for application with breeders and pathologists in sub-Saharan Africa.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0F380C2A-DB51-4EE3-BA0F-5326F013E6C0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3B69021A-1A80-478F-B30F-26EC06EED53F"><gtr:id>3B69021A-1A80-478F-B30F-26EC06EED53F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pathogen perception by NLRs in plants and animals: Parallel worlds.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/726b99131410e38904b91a54c298c9ad"><gtr:id>726b99131410e38904b91a54c298c9ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Duxbury Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0265-9247</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BB8DA864-F629-41CD-81B0-96848C025B9B"><gtr:id>BB8DA864-F629-41CD-81B0-96848C025B9B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparative analysis of plant immune receptor architectures uncovers host proteins likely targeted by pathogens.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/943b17b16ff38f2f4cde6b70bba429ba"><gtr:id>943b17b16ff38f2f4cde6b70bba429ba</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sarris PF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1741-7007</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L011646/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4661C82D-F66E-4672-BA82-7C12180BBDF7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>75BBF8D4-D2E9-4106-B484-743614789AF9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microorganisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C69AA8D-0736-45EE-BA77-D6E60B4C9893</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>20FF6FDE-28DB-4D9D-99E6-8470C745EA60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transcriptomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
