Our vision for the Platform Grant renewal reflects these changes and the need for more radical approaches in energy research. We wish to use the renewed Platform Grant to investigate the energy infrastructure that the UK will need out to 2050 and beyond. This will include technical aspects of gas and electricity infrastructure but also regulatory pathways that will support the policy goals. We would intend to use the Platform Grant resources to allow speculative research to be undertaken in preparation of major project funding bids, to develop further tools for the analysis of energy systems and to support research staff during short term gaps in funding. We particularly value the flexibility of the Platform Grant for developing the careers of younger research staff and would intend to continue to encourage researchers, at a suitable stage in their careers, to apply for permanent posts in UK universities and industry. The initial Platform Grant was, in our view, extremely successful with 3 of the RAs supported now permanent lecturers in UK universities and a significant contribution made to the understanding of how Distributed Generation could be integrated into the UK power system. Additional funding in excess of 7.5M was held by the Investigators during the period of the Platform Grant. 21 papers were published in the IEE Proceedings and the IEEE Transactions during this period and 7 major reports were submitted to DTI and OFGEM. Within the UK, the future architecture of the energy infrastructure is the subject of vibrant debate. The routes to implementation of this architecture are even more uncertain. Options range from fully distributed micro-generation to the integration of very large scale (GW) renewable or other low-carbon generation technologies including nuclear. Presently there are a number of research initiatives addressing micro generation and the Investigators contribute to a number of these projects. Therefore the initial research focus of the renewed Platform Grant will be on electricity and gas transmission systems although the flexibility of the Platform Grant will be utilized to remain responsive to changes in energy policy. We are, of course aware of the obvious desirability of reducing demand through demand reduction but consider the difficulty of substituting fossil fuels in transport to be so great that a large increase in electricity supply and transportation capacity may be necessary to supply stationary loads if the use of fossil fuels is reserved for transport.The Platform Grant resources will be used to allow speculative research to be undertaken in preparation of major project funding bids, to develop tools for the analysis of energy systems and to support research staff during short term gaps in funding. A series of exchanges of research staff between Imperial College and Manchester is planned. The flexibility of the Platform Grant will be used to support the career development of research staff including allowing them time to widen their research interests, to learn new techniques and engage with the rapidly changing energy research scene.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-12-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>291288</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Development of Transmission Network Design Standards: the first Offshore Network Design Standards</gtr:description><gtr:id>5DBC77B5-BEFD-47CB-8F67-362151CD9158</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reports

In particular this methodology was used for the development of the first Offshore Network Design Standards; it supported the Fundamental Review of the Supply Quality and Security Standards and the National Grid transmission investment programme recently approved by the Regulator. 
The cost-benefit methodology for optimal transmission design that Imperial team developed, documented in reports of the Centre for Sustainable Electricity and Distributed Generation, demonstrated to government, wind generation developers and network operators that following the conventional on-shore design rules (where network redundancy is a key feature) in off-shore development would be inefficient and would led to significant over-investment. The cost-benefit analysis undertaken by Imperial team, clearly demonstrated that there was no case for redundancy given the high cost of offshore cables (10-20 times onshore overhead lines) which was balanced against the low load factor (40%) of offshore wind farm generation, the low security value of offshore wind and the absence of demand offshore.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UK Power Networks</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>UKPN, LRE</gtr:description><gtr:id>492F0E01-3984-480B-868D-66B22098F94D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Load related expenditure model</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided networks database and advise about planning practice.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>As a major part of the development of our business and investment plans associated with reinforcement of our distribution networks, and given the unique modelling capability developed by Imperial College London team led by Prof Strbac, in 2011 UK Power Networks and Imperial commenced a joint project. The key objective was to develop, and then apply, a novel Load Related Expenditure Network Model that would provide enhanced long-term plans of the investment we need carry out across our three network areas, London, South East and East of England, in order to increase network capacity to accommodate demand and generation growth. This new tool enabled, for the first time, comprehensive impact assessments of a range of network development scenarios, including various uptake levels of low carbon technologies such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, commercial air conditioning, various forms of Distributed Generation including a range of smart grid technologies and energy efficiency measures. 
The model is all-inclusive and identifies constraints on all assets, circuits, substations, switchgear etc, for a range of conditions including thermal, voltage and fault-level, across all voltage levels (0.4kV, 11kV, 33kV/66kV and 132kV). The scale of network investment analysis that Imperial tool is capable of assessing is particularly impressive as the number of consumers in the UK Power Networks service areas is more than 8,000,000, supplied through more than 120,000 of distribution transformers with the total network length exceeding 180,000km. Imperial tool carries out detailed modelling of network voltage and thermal constraints and identifies the minimum cost network reinforcement for all our assets, while considering a number of different future development scenarios across multi-decade time horizons.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Strathclyde</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UK Centre for Sustainable Electricity and Distributed Generation (funded by then DTI and BERR), collaboration between Imperial, Strathclyde and Cardiff University (until 2010)</gtr:description><gtr:id>5ED7512C-9381-4224-BCF8-38D5D40126C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reports

The cost-benefit methodology for optimal transmission design that Imperial team developed, documented in reports of the Centre for Sustainable Electricity and Distributed Generation, demonstrated to government, wind generation developers and network operators that following the conventional on-shore design rules (where network redundancy is a key feature) in off-shore development would be inefficient and would led to significant over-investment. The cost-benefit analysis undertaken by Prof Strbac and his team, clearly demonstrated that there was no case for redundancy given the high cost of offshore cables (10-20 times onshore overhead lines) which was balanced against the low load factor (&amp;lt;40%) of offshore wind farm generation, the low security value of offshore wind and the absence of demand offshore. 
There are 20 offshore wind farms operational or under construction with a combined capacity of almost 4,000 MW. As documented by the Regulator Ofgem, the cost of the offshore network assets is &amp;pound;2.5bn and I estimate that the design with the new standard, based on the methodology developed by Imperial team, made savings of more than &amp;pound;500m. These benefits will significantly increase as further offshore projects are developed to meet the 2020 targets. It is presently envisaged that some 11GW of around 3 windfarms will be required, with potential further savings of &amp;pound;1-2Bn.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/oteg-gb-sqss-subgroup</gtr:url><gtr:year>2008</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Benefits of Smart Grids in Future Low-carbon Electricity Systems, Berlin, European Institute of Innovation and Technology - Smart Energy Summer School,August 2013.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>79825ADC-E515-46A3-A56A-8A9062B1D6F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of Benefits of Smart Grids in Future Low-carbon Electricity Systems and discussion afterwards

This is important as delivering renewable targets cost effectively, will require fundamental changes in the historical philosophy of network operation and considerable investment.

Through the developed methodologies and modelling carried out on the GB transmission network we demonstrated the present deterministic network design paradigm is not efficient, as the degree of security provided by the deterministic security criteria, using generic rules applied to all situations, will not be optimal in any particular instance as the cost of providing the prescribed level of redundancy is not compared with the reliability profile (cost) delivered.

We hence proposed probabilistic cost-benefit based framework includes key ingredients required for the development of future network operation (and development) standards to support efficient delivery of a low carbon electricity system. Only probabilistic standards can be used for determining the network capacity that should be released to network users in real time that will maximise the value of network access to all network users. Only probabilistic security standards can provide the basis for risks of supply interruptions to be understood, quantified and
managed through optimising the amount the network capacity
that is released to network users. 

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transmission investment can be substituted by more efficient smart grid technologies such as special protection schemes, coordinated voltage control technique supported by wide-area monitoring and control systems and grid friendly controllers for demand side management.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Methodologies develop can support the fundamental reviews of traditional electricity network design standards and adoption of smart grid technologies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7DC08816-FDED-4F54-B86E-04C29E23F454</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>An analysis of electricity system flexibility for Great Britain (joint report with Carbon Trust prepared for BEIS)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA665B6D-0253-471A-904A-5CAFF2246B5E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568982/An_analysis_of_electricity_flexibility_for_Great_Britain.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>IET Power Networks Joint Vision</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B58EDC5-5FB0-4DE7-8947-FEEF461EC9A2</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UK representative in International Energy Agency Annex 25 - Power Systems with Large Amounts of Wind Power</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>770E8ADB-2051-4F9A-A881-9938C2CBDCC8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Informed development of regimes for supporting development of renewable generation sources</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ieawind.org/task_25.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>G Strbac, Member of the Review Group of the Great Britain Security and Quality of Supply Standard (2008-2010)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4AA8CB0-39D0-4B7F-9657-23514F2C8559</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The cost-benefit methodology for optimal transmission design that Imperial College London team developed, documented in reports of the Centre for Sustainable Electricity and Distributed Generation, demonstrated to government, wind generation developers and network operators that following the conventional on-shore design rules (where network redundancy is a key feature) in off-shore development would be inefficient and would led to significant over-investment.
