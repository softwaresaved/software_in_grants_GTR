The investigation of ways to improve the targeting of these potential pharmaceuticals to a cell is therefore a major current area of medicinal chemistry research and development. Over the past few years a class polymers with multiple side-branches known as dendrimers have emerged as a promising means for enhancing and optimising drug delivery. The key advantage of using a dendrimer is that many drug molecules can be linked to the side-branches on the periphery of a dendrmer which can then deliver a high drug payload to a tumour cell for example. A further advantage is that the structure of a dendrimer is well-defined with a known size and drug loading, which makes them attractive to the pharmaceutical industry. In this project we propose to synthesise dendrimers containing a natural compound known as 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), which is used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. This treatment involves shining light onto a tumour (eg a skin tumour) to activate a photosensitising drug in the tumour resulting in the production of free radicals that are toxic to cancer cells. ALA is used for this therapy because once inside cells it is converted to a light-activated compound known as a porphyrin. To produce one porphyrin molecule, eight ALA molecules are combined through reactions involving a series of cellular enzymes. However ALA is not readily taken up by cells which limits its therapeutic efficacy in tumour treatment. For treating thicker skin tumours such as nodular basal cell carcinomas better penetration and higher cellular porphyrin levels throughout the tumour are required. In this project we propose a novel means of enhancing ALA uptake and porphyrin levels inside cells. New ALA derivatives would be synthesized in which ALA is linked with iron-binding compounds which, in combination with ALA, can induce a greater than additive or synergistic enhancement in porphyrin levels. These iron-binding or chelating compounds (HPOs) were developed at KCL originally to treat patients suffering from metabolic deficiencies which caused a build-up of iron in the body. Since these compounds are capable of reducing levels of free iron within cells, they should also inhibit the natural conversion of the photoactive porphyrin into a photoinactive form, called protohaem. Therefore iron chelation can result in a build-up of the photoactive porphyrin intermediate in the cells and potentially improve the therapeutic outcome. Since the porphyrin is fluorescent, we are able to use fluorescence detection to demonstrate the synergistic enhancement in porphyrin levels. We have recently carried out proof-of-principle studies on new compounds incorporating these two agents to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Our aim is to prepare conjugates of ALA and HPO molecules, starting from small single conjugates of both drugs increasing to nanoparticale size dendrimers. Incorporation of these relatively small molecules bound via ester linkages within dendrimers will enable a high payload of the bioactive agents to be codelivered to cells, and avoid the need to administer the drugs separately which would be limited by their differing pharmacological properties. The smaller compounds will be tested for surface or topical application on tissue, whereas the larger ones would be designed for oral and intravenous administration. The project would involve a concerted effort bringing together groups at KCL, Essex and UCL with complementary skills and experience in chemistry, biochemistry and photobiology, and would draw on expertise available at MedPharm Ltd in drug formulation and tissue explant studies. Although the work is focused on photodynamic therapy, the same principles may serve as a template for other agents in multiple drug therapy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-08-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>186303</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We are currently filing a patent having completed some supplementary studies since completion of the grant.

The investigation of ways to improve the delivery and targeting of these potential drugs is therefore a major current area of medicinal chemistry research and development. This report summarises the achievement of our research project on the biological testing of new compounds developed for cancer treatment, particularly skin tumours. 
In this collaborative project we synthesised and tested new drugs containing a natural compound known as 5-
aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) which is used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. The compounds were prepared at King's College London (KCL) and the University of Essex.

New ALA derivatives have been developed in which ALA is linked with iron-binding compounds which, in combination with ALA, can induce a greater than additive or synergistic enhancement in porphyrin levels. Since the prophyrin is fluorescent, we were able to use fluorescence detection to demonstrate the synergistic enhancement in porphyrin levels. a series of new compounds were tested in range of tumour cells and in pig skin samples. The optimum structures were identified following comparative studies and we were able to obtain comparable porphyrin levels in cells using much lower
concentration of the new drugs, by a factor of over 100 compared to ALA itself. The higher porphyrin levels also led to
higher cell kill following light exposure, and no dark toxicity was noted. The compounds worked successfully using excised pig skin and should therefore be effective in human skin. In summary, these new compounds have several advantages over ALA: firstly they can be used at much lower doses than ALA since they are taken up efficiently by cells, and induce high concentrations of the active agent (a porphyrin) in cells.

A UK company, MedPharm Ltd. was involved (at no cost, although not formally as a project partner) in testing the
compounds on skin. At UCL, the biological evaluation was carried out by a postodoctoral researcher who was shared with
the collaborating department at Essex University (45% FTE at UCL, 55% FTE at Essex) which was funded through the
same EPSRC programme. We were successful in meeting the main objectives of the project and are in the process of
patenting the new compounds. we have several manuscripts in preparation and expect to obtain up to four publications in
high quality journals (e.g. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry) stemming from this work. We have delayed submitting these
manuscripts for publication due to patenting considerations, but would point out that we have a good track record in
publishing on new ALA derivatives: in a previous BBSRC project on ALA-peptide derivatives, the team had six papers
published. We are also seeking further support to enable preparation and testing of conjugates for systemic use which
would help enhance the licensing potential to companies involved in this field. One leading company has already
expressed an interest in principle. Our clinical collaborators at University College Hospital have also expressed support for
clinical development of the new compounds and we believe that the potential impact of the project will be significant. a
more detailed description of the research carried out is presented as follows.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Patent pending. If approved we will approach companies about taking up a licence for these new compounds.
