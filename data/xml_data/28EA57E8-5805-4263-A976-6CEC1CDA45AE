It will do this by focusing on one country, Liberia, and exploring in-depth the relationship between national and international institutions and actors to understand how the linkages and processes between state and society are benefiting one of the most marginalised populations - persons with disabilities.

It is argued that persons with disabilities tend to be among the poorest in the world (Groce et al 2011), particularly in lower income and post-conflict countries. They frequently face social exclusion, marginalisation and stigmatisation. This generally implies they have limited &amp;quot;political voice&amp;quot;, which is reflected in a lack of attention to disability issues within national policies, in particular those aimed at poverty alleviation. As a result, the living conditions of persons with disabilities tend to worsen over time, facilitating a frequently discussed reciprocal link between disability and poverty - a 'vicious circle' - that produces a spiral of increasing deprivation. 

However, the Government of Liberia is trying to break this circle. Since the end of the brutal civil conflict in 2003 and the election of Africa's first female President in 2005, Liberia has taken a number of steps to try to improve the lives of persons with disabilities. It has signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), and has supported the establishment of a National Commission on Disability. One of the major international actors, the United Nations, through the Human Rights and Protection Section (HRPS) of the UN peacekeeping mission in Liberia (UNMIL), has been instrumental in facilitating a productive interchange and constant dialogue between the Liberian government and civil society, as well as increasing the human rights focus in national poverty reduction and policy development. These actions are based on the premise that it is possible to promote and foster a 'virtuous circle' in which the efforts of the Liberian Government can be reinforced through an iterative feedback process from persons with disabilities and their organisations. In order to understand this iterative process, further work needs to be undertaken using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to better understand the impact of policies and programmes on the lives of persons with disabilities across Liberia.

The promotion of wellbeing for persons with disabilities and their families is crucial in achieving equitable development, as measured by indicators such as the Millennium Development Goals, particularly considering the recent shift in the criteria for measuring country-level development performance from economic production to people's wellbeing (Stiglitz et al. 2009). This shift entails new challenges, different assessment and evaluation procedures, multidisciplinary theoretical approaches and new analytical strategies. 

This research will represent a first attempt to use an innovative approach to broaden knowledge in this area by surveying families that have at least one member with a disability, assessing quality of life indicators from different members within the same household, and analysing the information using methodologies which take into account the nested nature of this data. In addition, the research will be situated within the on-going international debate on wellbeing. Due to the complexity of both multidimensional poverty and disability issues, a multidisciplinary approach will be used and a broad range of stakeholders will be involved throughout the process, including disabled peoples organisations, NGOs, and universities.

If successful, the research project will be submitted to the UCL Ethics Committee for approval.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will situate a study of the quality of life and multidimensional poverty experienced by individuals with disability and their families in Liberia within the on-going international debate on wellbeing. There is a general agreement about the need to focus on inequalities as an essential determinant of wellbeing (Stiglitz et al, 2009). Therefore a study examining the subjective and objective wellbeing of individuals with disabilities and their families must be considered a priority, especially as disability is among the main sources of inequality in low income countries. Specifically, using a mixed method approach this study will collect information related to objective indicators of socio-economic wellbeing and the complex drivers of poverty (both established and emerging ones), including intergenerational transmission, and subjective indicators of psychosocial wellbeing, Due to the multidimensionality of poverty, the need for integration of objective and subjective well-being indicators and the complexity of disability issues, it is essential to adopt an interdisciplinary approach, including economic, sociological, anthropological and psychological competences. These will be reflected in assessment procedures that integrate different perspectives and methodologies, include a pilot phase to test and refine tools, and promote a culturally sensitive approach. We will adopt more a &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; than a &amp;quot;household&amp;quot; approach for data collection, surveying different members within the same household, balanced by gender and age. This will avoid the assumption that the information derived from head of households reflects perceptions and experiences of all members. In turn, this will identify differences linked to gender and age as well as specific issues related to the policy delivery process.

The primary beneficiaries will be persons with disabilities and their organisations (DPOs), policy makers, donors, and international and national actors working on poverty reduction, as it will support improved policy planning and implementation. The results will also be of interest to UN agencies, NGOs, universities and think-tanks supporting on-going work on disability and poverty.

There is a clear indication from the Liberian government and international community of the pressing need to increase inclusion of persons with disabilities into policies and programmes that alleviate poverty and improve wellbeing. Greater understanding of gaps and generation of evidence-based data on persons with disabilities will increase the effectiveness of national and international programmes aimed at fostering inclusive development and better living conditions, guiding the design and implementation of more effective and sustainable interventions. Universities and think-tanks will be involved throughout the project to promote interest and commitment to disability research by in-country research programmes. The results of this research will provide foundations for planning future long-term longitudinal national studies aimed at highlighting causal pathways to poverty in a context sensitive perspective.

Results will be disseminated though publications, policy briefs and updates, shared with a range of government and civil society partners, with particular attention to the Human Rights and Disability Task Force (HRDTF), at national and local levels. This group will provide a forum at which to present findings and a platform for robust input into on-going research. The results will also be presented to the National Disability Commission, who are well positioned to utilise the research findings in advocacy and campaigning.

A key stakeholder workshop, to be held in Monrovia in the inception phase, will ensure all partners and stakeholders are fully engaged with, and have input into, the project. In addition to local partners, the team will invite members of the HRDTF, government ministry representatives, UN representatives, academics, DPOs and NGOs</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>402188</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Radio presentation in Liberia (Truth FM)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>18C27933-16A2-4779-BDC2-62BF9A5862E7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Maria Kett and Ms Ellie Cole were invited to join Mr Mohamed Kohneh, Director of Inclusive Education, Ministry of Education on his weekly call-in radio show on Truth FM, a well-respected radio station with national reach.

2016 report
1. Cambridge Disability Impact Initiative workshop (29 February-1 March). Disability has been identified as a cross-cutting theme by the Impact Initative and this event bought together a range of grant holders specifically working on disabiltiy issues from across the Poverty Alleviation scheme, giving them an opportunity to share research outcomes and enhance impact. Dr Kett gave a presentation on progress to-date. There were in-depth discussions on ways in which findings can be communicated to ensuring the greatest positive impact on the lives of persons with disabilities within the wider framework of the SDGs. Dr Kett was also videoed for the Impact Initiative website discussing the potential impact of the research in Liberia.

2. ESRC-DFID Joint Fund for Poverty Alleviation Research in Pretoria, 16-18 March. Dr Kett and Mr Richard Ngafuan (University of Liberia) will attend the conference in Pretoria and present the research to date in Liberia. The conference is a key opportunity to raise awareness of the project with other ESRC grant holders and develop key linkages and networks to increase its impat.
Dr Kett is also co-leading a side panel on 'Multi-sectoral approaches to disability and poverty alleviation' at the event, which will further bring together a range of interested parties to share ideas, discuss policy and practice impacts, as well as develop a road map for impact.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9611D49D-1E70-4D7C-920C-FD8DCFDE87D5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>That subjective well-being as experienced by persons with disability is lower than non-disabled people in the same communities, despite objectively having similar levels of poverty. Therefore, a significance of this is that as both disabled and non-disabled people experience low levels of literacy; and lack of access to employment and healthcare, so as development increases, there is a need to ensure there is equity of growth and development across both groups, to ensure persons with disabilities are not being left behind. A number of implications can be drawn from this, including how services are delivered; who they are delivered to and how, to address the gap in subjective perceptions of wellbeing for person with disabilities in Liberia.

Total sample = 2,020 (46.8% male; 53.2% female)

Although the overall sample had similar levels of education - almost half of both disabled and non-disabled households had no formal education, 70% of both groups of household were [functionally] illiterate, and around the same proportion were innumerate. However, women with disabilities had the lowest literacy/numeracy rates of sample populations (86% compared to 77% non-disabled women).

One key finding is that despite objectively similar levels of wellbeing; from a subjective perspective, disabled households reported feeling that their wellbeing was lower than in non-disabled households. Significantly, disabled women were much more likely to be completely unsatisfied with their lives (65% compared with 42% of non-disabled women). Disabled households also felt that their standard of living was lower compared to other households in their community.

Most disabled households (89.9%) were members of community groups. Predominantly religious groups (84.6% disabled households). However, participation in community activities was lower in disabled households (61.1% compared with 72.7% in non-disabled households). The main reasons given were lack of desire to join (30.2%), but also and the negative attitudes of community members (20.9%). Disabled households also felt less included in community decision-making.

Significantly less disabled households report voting (92.1% v79.9%) - and 20% of disabled HHs did not think voting makes a difference. Strikingly, 22% of disabled women never voted, compared with 8% of non-disabled women. The main reasons given for this (apart from not being registered) were that they were not able to get to the polling station (13%) or that it is not accessible (12%). This is especially significant given that there is an election in Liberia later this year (October 2017).

During the Ebola crisis, 90% of disabled households reported they got their information from community leaders; in non-disabled households they reported getting their information from a mixture of government/local authority, community leaders and health workers. This has implications for how prevention and other messages are communicated to persons with disabilities.

In addition, in Ebola affected communities, 83.7% of persons with disabilities felt they were treated differently during Ebola, compared with 61.9% of persons with disabilities in non-Ebola-affected communities. Persons with disabilities in both Ebola affected and non-affected areas reported that they had become more isolated in their communities during the crisis. Again, this has implications for how programmes and services are delivered.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research team are currently in discussions with the Ministry of Justice in Liberia with regards to input in the Liberia UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) report to the United Nations Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which is due in July 2017. The research team have also set up a task group including the National Commission on Disability, the National Union of Persons with Disabilities, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Gender, Social Welfare and Children, and other stakeholders to discuss how the findings can be used in national SDG indicators and reporting, as well as the planned UNCRPD 'shadow report' from civil society.

The Government of Liberia (GoL) are currently holding consultation about indicators that will be used to monitor national progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. The results of this research have the potential to feed into this process and ensure that disability issues are included in the indicators

Toward this aim, a validation workshop will be held in Liberia in April. Attendees to the workshop will include academics, representatives from disabled people's organisations, ministries and national and international NGOs. A final dissemination event is also planned for June, to which a range of stakeholders will be invited, including representatives of the GoL, UN agencies, DFID, NGOs, disabled people's organisation and civil society.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CDD8E321-AF91-4038-A60E-21BC4535B351</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://gap.leonardcheshire.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Liberia-Presentation-LSTM-230916.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L005719/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE8091C9-38A1-47B0-ACDE-331864A8A453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law, Democracy and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
