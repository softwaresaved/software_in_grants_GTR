They regulate our sleep/wake cycle, body temperature, and many other aspects of physiology and behaviour. Our master circadian clock resides in the brain, in a structure called the Supra Chiasmatic Nuclei (SCN). It consists of thousands of neurons which all express a set of so called 'clock genes'. These genes are special, since they regulate each other via feedback loops, meaning that the product of one gene represses another gene or even its own expression. As a result, molecular oscillations of many of these genes can be observed that occur with a frequency of ca. 24 hrs: our circadian molecular clock work! But this is not enough to achieve a circadianly rhythmic behaviour: For example to determine if we should be active or go to sleep, the SCN neurons somehow have to signal the time-of-day to other regions of our brain and body, for example to the pineal gland, which produces the 'sleeping hormon' melatonin when the SCN says so. SCN (or pacemaker) neurons do this, by producing electric signals (action potentials) in a rhythmic fashion; somehow regulated by the molecular clock. But how does this work? Recent evidence indicates that the properties of the neuronal membrane are rhythmically changed by the molecular clock, but again, the question remains how this is accomplished. In our model organism, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the situation is quite similar. It also has pacemaker neurons in its brain which express many clock genes in a circadian fashion. We recently isolated a novel rhythmically expressed gene called quasimodo (qsm), which is present in some of the clock neurons and is probably attached to the outside of their membranes. When we experimentally change the expression level of qsm (make more or less of it compared to normal flies), we induce very similar effects as if we manipulate genes that alter the electrical activity of neurons (called ion-channels). Therefore we believe that qsm interacts with at least some of these genes, and because its expression is controlled by the molecular clock, qsm could well be a factor that connects the clock with the neuronal membrane! To find this out we want to identify, which of the ion channel proteins interact with the Qsm protein and what exactly happens when we influence their expression. We also noticed that under certain circumstances of manipulating neuronal membrane proteins, we can observe strong behavioural rhythms in the absence of clock genes, which always were thought to be absolutely required for such rhythms. This is very astonishing and implies that there are rhythm-generating properties intrinsic to the neuronal membrane. We will try to find out what generates these rhythms by performing a mutagenesis screen where we will look for mutants that abolish the rhythms in the abnormally rhythmic flies. Our idea is that there are two rhythm-generating mechanisms: The known one consisting of the clock genes and their products, and another one, operating in the neuronal membranes. We think they are connected to each other, and with the experiments outlined in this proposal we want to show how the clock genes control the membrane oscillator and how in turn the membrane oscillator feeds back to control the clock genes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Behavioural circadian rhythms in both mammals and flies are driven by specialized pacemaker neurons in the brain. Clock gene transcriptional feedback loops operate within these neurons, and regulate their rhythmic output. One such output is thought to be rhythmic electric activity, which could trigger rhythmic neuropeptide release thereby regulating behavioural rhythms. Electrical properties of the neuronal membrane are also crucial to maintain molecular rhythms in the nucleus. The experiments outlined here address how electrical activities can be regulated and controlled by the molecular feedback loops. We propose that the novel rhythmically expressed gene quasimodo (qsm), which encodes a putative membrane bound ZP-domain protein, is involved in this process. Our preliminary data show that over-expressing, or down-regulating qsm expression has similar effects on behavioural rhythms and neuropeptide accumulation as observed after manipulation of various ion channel genes. We identified a potential clock gene-independent and membrane-based circadian oscillator after interfering with qsm function. We plan to isolate proteins, which interact with the Qsm protein by various molecular and genetic approaches. Manipulating their function individually and in combination with altering qsm levels, will reveal if and how they are involved in circadian rhythm generation. By applying a Drosphila cell culture system we will determine the effects of Qsm and its interacting partners on the cellular distribution and release of the circadian neuropeptide PDF. Making use of our well established real-time luciferase reporter gene assay, we will investigate if the various membrane proteins feed back to the molecular clock by influencing clock gene expression. This will be the first comprehensive analysis aimed at isolating factors that regulate rhythmic events in circadian neuronal pacemaker membranes and their relation to the known rhythm entities.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>398750</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>James Hodge</gtr:description><gtr:id>84F3810D-1519-492A-B548-7ECD5CB4CD25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A direct out come of this collaboration was a joint BBSRC grant (BB/J018589/1) and one joint publication so far (Hodge and Stanewsky 2008)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Hodge lab performed electrophysiological analysis of qsm and other mutants involved in light and temperature entrainment of the Drosophila clock</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration on light input to the Drosophila clock.

We now generated Qsm antibodies and could show that Qsm is an acutely light-responsive protein suggesting that it functions in the light-input to the Drosophila clock. This was supported by the observation that down-regulation of Qsm expression in clock cells induced behavioural rhythmicity in constant light (LL). LL normally induces arrhythmic behaviour and LL-rhythmicity therefore points to a disruption of light-input to the clock. We identified the clock neurons that are responsible for driving this LL-rhythmicity and found that they largely coincide with dorsal clock neurons (groups DN1 and DN3) that do not express the known circadian photoreceptor Cry.



2) We focussed on this light-input function of Qsm and were able to show that Qsm (like Cry) supports the light-dependent degradation of the clock protein Timeless (Tim), and that (like Cry) Qsm downregulation protects Tim from degradation. Surprisingly, this function of Qsm is Cry-independent, suggesting that it forms part of a novel light-input pathway to the clock.



3) We were able to show that downregulation of Qsm can rescue clock function in arrhythmic per01 mutants. These rescued per01 flies show a robust anticipatory behaviour of the light-off transition in the evening as well as rhythmic behaviour in LL (containing ultradian and circadian components). To our knowledge this latter observation is the first demonstration of sustained behavioural rhythmicity of per01 mutants under constant environmental conditions. These findings demonstrate the existence of a period-independent oscillator with ultradian and circadian properties.



4) We wanted to identify the molecular bases of this novel oscillator and tested if it is influenced by other know clock genes. It turned out that oscillator function was compromised in timeless and dominant negative cycle mutants, indicating that it is linked to the known molecular clock loop, yet independent of period. Given that we observed Tim oscillations in per01 qsm double mutant flies during LL, we think that the Tim oscillations can be driven by other clock genes in the absence of per. 



5) We found that Qsm genetically interacts with the Shaw K+ channel and the Na-K-Cl transporter CG31547. Based on the predicted membrane-localization of Qsm, it is likely that Qsm regulates this channels/transporters. Supporting this hypothesis we found that downregulation of the potential qsm interactors also leads to LL rhythmicity; in case of Shaw even in the absence of per. per-independent rhythms observed in qsm mutants do depend on other clock genes and are also observed after altering Shaw levels. We therefore think that a neuronal membrane based oscillator exists, which we uncovered here. This oscillator does depend at least on a partially functionally clock or clock components, and it most likely involves rhythmic changes of electrical neuronal properties.



6) It has been proposed and reported that rhythmic electrical neuronal properties are necessary for sustained clock function in constant darkness (DD) We could show that overexpressing Shaw did not disrupt clock gene expression in DD, but led to a weak period-lengthening (Hodge and Stanewsky, 2008). Together with our observation that downregulation of qsm leads to phase delay of rhythmic qsm expression, this suggests that altering electrical properties of clock neurons does not disrupt clock function (as previously published reports suggested) but modulates clock speed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our data is or will be published in open access journals and/or on our laboratory homepage.
