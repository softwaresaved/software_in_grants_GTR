It is based on a two year study of the programme conducted by Professor Keri Facer (Leadership Fellow for Connected Communities) and Dr Bryony Enright (Connected Communities Post-Doctoral Researcher). The study involved 100 interviews with programme participants, a questionnaire completed by 309 participants, workshops with 60+ community partners, collaboration with seven projects in which university-community collaborations were used to analyse the legacy of specific elements in the programme, and two 12 month case studies of individual projects. Findings have been developed iteratively throughout the study with programme participants. 

Motivations - One of the first questions the study was interested in is - who is attracted to this sort of collaborative project between community and university partners, and why? Participants' motivations can be clustered into 6 broad characteristic groups: generalists and learners (who are interested in new ideas and connections), makers (who are interested in getting something tangible made or changed), scholars (who are interested in finding opportunities to pursue specific interests), entrepreneurs (who are attracted by the funding opportunities), accidental wanderers (who end up in the programme by happenstance), advocates for a new knowledge landscape (who are explicitly looking to experiment with new ways to create knowledge). These motivations are characteristic of both university and community partners. 98% of survey respondents reported they would do this sort of collaborative work again. 

Participants - The Community Partners participating in the programme are highly diverse, with groups ranging from large national organisations and charities with established research capabilities, to smaller precarious and voluntary organisations, to individual community activists and artists. An important reason for many community partners to participate was the perception that this funding would allow them to take a step back, address fundamental questions and develop new insights about their work. For many groups, this was a unique opportunity as they often find themselves on a constant treadmill of activity and evaluation, often working to different and sometimes conflicting evaluation frameworks. 

Purposes for practical collaboration - The university and community partners tended to work together for practical reasons (it was impossible to conduct the research any other way), for personal reasons (they had shared interests, commitments and ideas), and for symbolic reasons (university partners sought the 'authenticity' offered by collaboration with communities, and community partners sought the 'legitimacy' offered by collaboration with universities). 

Accountability issues - There are competing accountabilities on projects - these are internal to the project teams: to community partners, to university partners, to community members; and external to the project teams: to disciplinary fields, to the wider public good, to personal social networks. These internal and external accountabilities require careful articulation and the tensions between them have to be carefully addressed. 

Deep traditions - While the idea of 'co-producing' research may only recently have come into vogue in the research councils, the CC programme demonstrates the longstanding and highly diverse traditions that project teams draw upon when invited to conduct 'collaborative research'. The different traditions at play in the programme include but are not limited to: traditions of participatory, collaborative and community engaged research; people's history; environmental activism; participatory ethnography; traditions of responsible innovation and public engagement; particpatory/action research; co-design and user-centred design approaches; civil rights, feminist and disability rights traditions; crowd/commons and open innovation approaches. 

Competing logics - These traditions bring very different rationales and methods for the processes of collaborative research. There are key differences, for example, between those traditions that seek university-community collaboration for reasons of equity and democracy, and those that see it primarily as a means of improving the quality of research and practice. Indeed, the idea of 'community' is framed very differently in different traditions - with some partnerships particularly concerned with capacity building amongst grassroots communities and others with building policy-level knowledge with representative organisations. 


The fantasy of 'community' and 'university' - Project partnerships are often formed on the basis of inchoate ideas about what 'the university' and 'the community' might offer to projects. A central part of the work of collaborative research, therefore, requires treating these fantasies seriously. Such questions can require project teams to reflect upon their own claims to authority: to what extent do community partners really represent 'the community'? To what extent do university partners represent the only or most appropriate way of producing meaningful knowledge? Such work is necessarily unsettling and can be disruptive of existing identities. 

Expertise required - Negotiating different traditions, different motivations for participation and different relations of accountability requires expertise. To make projects work requires a highly diverse set of roles within the team, these include: the catalyser (who prompts and disrupts), the integrator (who synthesises), the designer (who connects and creates a plan), the broker (who negotiates relationships), the facilitator (who enables conversations), the project manager (who addresses progress and risks), the diplomat (who handles inter-institutional relations), the scholar (who connects the project with existing knowledge and ensures rigour), the conscience (who asks how the project is benefiting communities), the accountant (who manages the money), the data gatherer (who conducts the empirical/archival research), the nurturer (who keeps an eye on all participants), the loudhailer (who promotes the work). Notably, these roles are taken in these projects by both university and community partners. 

Funding benefits - Funding for collaborative research that enables community partners to be remunerated for expenses and time is essential in introducing new and diverse experiences into the research process. Civil society, community and cultural organisations simply are unable to access resources to participate in reflective projects without funding. As a consequence, economically marginalised communities are effectively shut out of the landscape of research production without such resource. The money matters significantly. The funding has significantly enhanced the capacity of projects to learn from the experiences and perspectives of economically marginalised communities. It has enabled investment in people, materials, equipment and institutions which has in turn supported further investment in collaborative research by some universities. The funding also plays an important symbolic role in signalling that this sort of research is valued and valuable. 

Funding issues - The form that funding takes, however, matters significantly - short term projects are significantly less beneficial than longer term support of partnership working. The relationship between individuals and groups committed to collaborative long term partnerships can be significantly negatively impacted and rendered instrumental if the consequences, politics and implications of project-based funding are not discussed from the outset. At the same time, for small organisations, significant sudden project based funding can cause difficulties in terms of longer term sustainability of activities with volunteers. The unintended consequences of 'success' in gaining research funding have to be carefully considered by all parties. 

Time and money - There is also often a discrepancy between formal allocation of time and resources and the lived experience of individuals working on such projects. Participants report that such research requires significantly more time than is usually budgeted for. As a consequence, research assistants, who are junior members of the team but who tend to have the most time formally allocated to projects, tend to take a disproportionate responsibility for the success of these collaborations. Managing project finances through university systems that are often highly bureaucratic can also have negative impacts on community-university relations. 

Reframing impact - In the area of research 'impact' these projects are leading to a reassessment of how we might understand the idea of what counts as a positive legacy from research partnerships. Indeed, they are troubling the linear and popular model of research impact as a simple process that runs from 'paper' through to real world 'application. Instead, they are demonstrating that more sustainable, embodied and transformative legacies are produced through ongoing interactions between publics and universities throughout the development of projects and partnerships. 

Multiple legacies - Project teams are working with plural notions of legacy, and the programme as a whole is developing significant impacts in six areas: the creation of new products (websites, guidelines, toolkits, academic papers, software, exhibitions, booklets, artworks, reports, performances); the creation of new networks and relationships; the development of new theories, ideas and concepts (relating to communities, histories of community and means of researching community); the strengthening and evolution of institutions (community partners are developing new services and strengthening their research capacities, universities are adapting their systems and developing greater capacity for collaboration). 

Embodied legacies - The most significant and sustainable legacies, however, are embodied. Participants in projects are developing new skills, knowledge and understanding as well as the confidence to put these into action in the networks, organisations and partnerships they are involved with beyond the project itself. At the same time, the programme has nurtured the development of a new generation of community and university researchers who have 'grown up collaborative' and who take for granted the value and potential benefits of interdisciplinary community-university partnerships. 

Limitations to funding models - There are some limitations to Connected Communities/research council funding as a model of creating powerful collaborations between universities and communities. First, those groups who are under-represented within University faculty demographics, in particular both visible and invisible minorities, may find it harder to create connections and collaborations with universities leading to research that is impoverished by losing these sets of expertise and insight. Second, investment in partnerships through a project based approach does not easily facilitate the slower participatory forms of research that require commitment over time. Third, the relatively short timescales of the majority of projects (6-18 months) militates against the relationship building that would produce better outcomes. 

Work still to do - There remains a need for research and scholarship, therefore, that is explicitly accountable to a wider public good; for more explicit and targeted attempts to diversify both faculty and the range of groups who partner with universities; and for ongoing community-university relationships to be sustained and nurtured through core and partnership funding rather than project based research funding. 

Key recommendations - The following are the top level recommendations arising from this study of the Connected Communities Programme 

a. Recommendation 1: Take the simple steps needed to enhance the infrastructure for high quality collaborative research partnerships, 
In particular by addressing the following priorities: 
i. Extending Connected Communities funding models 
ii. Investing in research assistants for the long term
iii. Capacity building for early career researchers, doctoral students and peer reviewers
iv. Developing University professional services 
b. Recommendation 2: Recognise that time is to collaborative research what a supercomputer is to big data. 
In particular, through the following three priority areas:
i. Extending (the same) funding over longer time scales
ii. Rebalancing funding for partnerships and projects
iii. Creating connections between teaching and research
c. Recommendation 3: Take explicit steps to mitigate the risk of enhancing inequalities through collaborative research and partnerships. 
In particular, through addressing the following priorities: 
i. Funders should develop a more nuanced lexicon of types of community partners and the forms of funding and support that might be offered to or requested from different groups.
ii. Explicit efforts need to be made to understand and address the barriers that prevent different minority groups from contributing to research projects.
iii. Research investment needs to be considered in the wider context of the university as a whole.
d. Recommendation 4: Invest in civil society's public learning infrastructure through one key priority: 
i. The establishment of a new funding programme open to civil society organisations resourced by a combination of RCUK and the larger Charitable Trusts and Foundations

To conclude. The Connected Communities programme demonstrates that 'public value' from research is not about creating short term, instrumental partnerships in which universities offer quick evaluations or specialist inputs in exchange for communities offering access to a 'real world'. Rather, it is about creating substantive conversations between the different sets of expertise and experience that university and community partners offer, and in so doing, enabling the core questions that both are asking to be reframed and challenged. Such a set of relationships is far from the na&amp;iuml;ve economic model that would see the value of research judged by its immediate utility. Instead, it is about the creation of a new public knowledge landscape where communities, and the universities that form part of those communities, can collaborate to question, research and experiment to create new ways of understanding, seeing and acting in the world.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from the Connected Communities Programme have already been used in a number of ways by the Research Councils. 1.
