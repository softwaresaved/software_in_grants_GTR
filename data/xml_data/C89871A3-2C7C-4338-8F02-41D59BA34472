The visual system is one of the largest and most important parts of the brain. A core function of the visual system is to process and interpret motion. Motion is a critical cue in the environment because it underlies our abilities to interact with the world. When objects are in a cluttered environment they can move behind and around other objects. These movements cause objects to disappear from view for large intervals of space and time before reappearing later. Humans are able to easily perceive motion along these complex paths. However, our current understanding of the brain cannot explain how this is accomplished. The proposed research will allow us to develop new models of how the brain processes motion, one of the most important roles of vision for a mobile animal such as ourselves. 

Over the last 4-5 decades, a beautiful architecture has been worked out showing how the brain progressively processes moving stimuli to create a cohesive and correct impression of motion in the world. The details of this architecture has improved our knowledge of how groups of neurons our organized and communicate. The wider neuroscientific community has utilized the impacts of these conceptual advances. The understanding of the brains response to motion enables researchers to build more complicated experiments that probe other functions of the brain. For example, because we know how motion is integrated across brain regions it has become an important stimulus used to study how the brain creates decisions about the world. This makes motion a fundamentally important topic underpinning our efforts for a complete understanding of the brain. 

But this detailed and elegant work is insufficient as it can only explain motion processing over small regions of space: our current models can misinterpret an objects true motion. We are missing an understanding of how motion is integrated when there are missing segments in the motion of an object. This is an important feature of real objects moving through the natural environment. It happens when objects move behind surfaces. The missing segments make it difficult to interpret what is happening. Our current understanding of the brain doesn't explain how this works. Humans, however, are able to perceive motion from a wide variety of stimuli that can move in complex environments. The neural mechanisms responsible for this ability have yet to be identified and characterized.
 
The proposed project will provide a missing piece of our understanding of the brain by determining a better and more general understanding of how the brain processes moving objects. This will be accomplished by combining multiple state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods. In the past, brain imaging tools have been able to study either brain function across space (the classic 'brain areas' identified by fMRI), or across time (EEG recordings from the scalp). My work will allow these tools to be combined in powerful new ways. These tools will be used to create a complete picture of the set of brain areas, and how they interact to process motion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Motion processing has been an extremely successful model system for neuroscience and has led to fundamental advances in our understanding. The theoretical concepts of how to construct a motion detector have led to better understandings of the neural circuitry of both fruit flies and humans. In the primate visual system it has been shown that the brain progressively processes moving stimuli to create a cohesive and correct impression of motion in the world. The standard model of the primate visual system is that local motion signals are first processed in area V1, and then these local signals are then combined by area MT (and it's human homolg hMT+) to form an integrated percept of motion direction. 

This model of motion processing, however, is incomplete. It does not explain the perception of long-range motion. In the natural environment long-range motion can happen, for example, when objects move behind surfaces. V1 and MT cannot respond to motion over large spatial extents and long temporal delays. In both V1 and MT, motion sensitivity derives from and is limited by sub-units within their receptive fields. These limit the motion sensitivity in these regions to short spatio-temporal regions. Humans, however, have long been known to be able to perceive motion from a wide variety of stimuli that can have large spatial separations (described as 'long-range' motion). Yet the neural mechanisms specialized for long-range processing have yet to be identified and characterized.

The goal of the proposed projects is to determine how the brain processes long-range motion. This will be accomplished by first determining the set of regions involved in long-range motion processing and how they interact. Secondly, by testing competing hypothesis of how motion is processed using powerful new ways of combining fMRI and EEG imaging tools. Thirdly, by determining how occlusion information is integrated into motion processing.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>My proposal is for core human neuroscience research with no immediate application to UK-plc. However, I have identified groups of possible indirect stakeholders, and direct stakeholders:

Technologists developing systems and content for next generation displays
Whilst the basic neuroscientific knowledge we generate will not be of direct interest to this group, they should be interested in the characterization of what components of a visual stimulus are utilized to perceive motion. Currently half of all internet bandwidth is utilized by streaming video and this is projected to rise to 80% within 5 years. Compression technology is currently a major limitation for delivering video content. While audio information obtained massive benefits from knowledge of the perceptual limitations of hearing (MP3 compression), the same is not true for video content. Understanding what components of motion are utilized for perception may help guide the creation of more efficient systems compression algorithms and display technology. 

Medical professionals
Motion processing deficits are present in several neurological disorders, including amblyopia, schizophrenia, Williams Syndrome, and fragile X disorder. One reason it is important to understand visual processing in neurotypicals is that because these neurological disorders present with associated visual deficits it may be possible create simple and inexpensive tests that compare against neurotypical benchmarks. A more complete understanding of how humans process motion information will therefore be of relevance to individuals diagnosing and treating patients with neurological disorders. 

The general public
Understanding how the brain works is always a very popular topic with the general public of all ages. This therefore provides an excellent opportunity for public engagement, to involve people in understanding how the brain is needed for sight. Public engagement will be accomplished through participation in events for the public organized by the Univeristy of St Andrews</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>392510</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N018516/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F439A20B-A9B0-4A68-B703-7F6AE7570E39</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems neuroscience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
