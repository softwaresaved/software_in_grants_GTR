Self-organising (i.e. the ways in which communities organise themselves) is one of the three inter-linked processes (along with market-led and state-led mechanisms) that underpin any pragmatic and innovative transition to an adapted urban environment that is closer to being carbon neutral and that may be more resilient to the challenges resulting from changing (climate-induced) weather patterns. In the past considerable work has been carried out on the role of market-led and state-led initiatives, however, we understand far less about the ways in which civil society constructs what are sometimes alternative and sometimes complementary ways of addressing climate change.
Building on existing research and practice on adapting the built environment, urban neighbourhoods and facilitating energy transition, the project will combine social researcher-led work with participant action research to explore, record and enhance the ways community activists are organizing innovative, creative and pragmatic climate change responses in their communities (of place and of space).
It will set out how the problem(s) of climate change are understood both by these activists/practitioners and by the community members they work with. The project will create space for activists to identify capacity-building needs and for the research team to work with activists to fill these needs. Through these interactive and reflective activities the academic and practitioners teams will tease out the tensions and potentials of the inter-relation of everyday knowledge and technical knowledge on climate challenge responses. Not only does this project analyse the tensions in these forms of knowledge creation within a given national context, but it also uses cross-national comparison to help participants break out of culturally implicit (and fixed) constructions of both the climate change problem and the opportunities for change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One of the central aims of the project is also to actively engage in and facilitate, in an inter-active manner, the development of self-organisation in relation to specific, locally constructed, challenges of climate change. Here the aim of this project is to help build processes for supporting collective action to do more and disseminate the results more widely. It will do this firstly by analysing and reflecting on the increasing options for local people to become self-organised and interact with emerging technologies for adaptation as well as how, in local contexts, more 'low-tech' strategies may be developed and articulated with 'high-tech' approaches. Thereby producing useful examples of the different ways in which local adaptation and mitigation can be developed, encouraging cross-case interaction and identification of good practices and help enhance local capacity to act. The project will thus give space to practitioners of self-organisation to reflect on their practice and to make those lessons more widely available locally, nationally and Europe-wide. The key lessons derived from this work will to be made available via the change agent organisations but also made available to European and national policy makers. 
By these means the project will also contribute to supporting the aims of Europe 2020 and its key goals of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It will also compliment the increasingly important notion of social innovation as contained in the EUs Social Innovation Research in the European Union (2013) and the key ideas that: social innovation be focussed on the institutional (meso) and the individual (micro) level rather than the societal level; cross-case exchanges to add value to the work; and that stakeholders be included as co-producers of new knowledge and practices. In the UK case it will contribute to Climate Change Policy by helping to demonstrate the role that local communities can play in developing activities at local level and achieving different forms of adaptation/mitigation relevant to the needs of local people. Moreover, the focus on self-organisation is very much in the spirit of 'localism' that pervades much of the current government's thinking about how society should be organised and the increased role for local action and decision-making implicit in such an approach. Given this we will interact with organisations such as the RTPI and LGA.
It is also important to bear in mind that the case studies on self-organisation apply participatory approaches. The objective of participatory research is to modify the asymmetric relation between researchers and researched, in which the researched is often reduced to being a &amp;quot;research object&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;data carrier&amp;quot;. Participatory approaches recognise local people as experts on local life and society who can provide advice to less informed outsiders. At the same time, because the &amp;quot;outsider&amp;quot; is not involved directly in local affairs, and thus not a potential competitor over resources etc., it is expected that the researcher can provide the local people with additional information on her understanding of local life and conditions, which often differ from the local interpretations. Participatory research focuses on these different views and understandings in the sense that through communication among persons mutually recognizing each other, a learning process takes place on both sides.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>223387</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Regional Studies Association Conference (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D92B8B4C-5673-4C25-9164-A3AF51C5529C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The PARCOUR Research Associate (Dr. David Williams) presented a paper (A comparison of public-private partnership development of previously used land in the UK) on behalf of the UK research team at the Regional Studies Association - Winter Conference, 2016, Holiday Inn Bloomsbury, London.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Already the work carried out during 2016 has facilitated the development of the two local groups we are working with by enabling them to reflect on what they are doing and why. it has also allowed them to clarify their objectives and assess the degree to which they are meeting those objectives.

1) Q Methodology offers a means of mapping, identifying and critically evaluating the patterns of subjective perspectives held by actors on a given topic. Q methodology involves &amp;quot;each participant in the sample (the P sample) sorting a series of statements (a Q sample) representative of the breadth of debate on an issue (the concourse) into a distribution of preference (the Q sort) from which statistically significant factors are derived and interpreted&amp;quot; (Jeffares, S. and Skelcher, C. 2011 'Democratic Subjectivities in Network Governance: A Q Methodology Study of English and Dutch Public Managers', Public Administration 89(4): 1253-1273. p.1257).
Drawing on a Q Methodology study involving nearly 100 participants in towns and cities in Germany, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, the Self City project has explored how community activists involved in local 'self-organised' groups construct understandings of climate change and collective action. To the best of our knowledge this is one of the few examples where Q Methodology has been used on this scale in 3 different countries and one of even fewer to investigate climate change.
We used a set of 47 Q Statements drawn from a literature review encompassing multiple aspects of climate change and local self-organisation: environmental discourse, socio-technical regimes, transition theory, strategic niche management, eco-localisation, ecological citizenship, and public attitudes to climate change. 
The UK team conducted 56 Q Sort interviews with participants of Transition Keynsham and Winchester Action on Climate Change during the summer of 2016. Interviews lasted between 45 and 90 minutes. Participants were asked to order the 47 statements, on an upturned pyramid distribution grid, which offered levels of agreement or disagreement on a Likert scale. Participants were asked to clarify the meanings that they attributed to statements, and to explain their rationale for the positioning of statements, especially those with which they 'most strongly' or 'least' agreed. 
Our preliminary (project wide) factor analysis identifies four distinct discourses of self-organised response to climate change: 1) 'radical green' which combines strong ecological values (e.g. redefining human 'wellbeing') with a robust critique of neo-liberalism; 2) 'pragmatic reformism' which emphasises the synergy between environmental protection, economic growth and social inclusion and advocates incremental reform to the extant political-economic system; 3) 'government-oriented puritan' which foregrounds strong green values (e.g. limits to growth) but affords primary responsibility for action to government; and, 4) 'hedonist dissent' which eschews explicit green narratives in favour of building local social capital and adopting a confrontational approach to formal structures of political and economic power. 
The four discourses demonstrate that local 'self-organisers' articulate very different challenges and opportunities vis-a-vis climate change, while privileging discrete responses and forms of agency. Our on-going analysis critically assesses the connections and differences between the discourses, the demands and rhetorical appeals they communicate, and the influence of national and demographic contexts on them. 
The same questions were also used in the Netherlands and Germany (in English in the Netherlands and translated in Germany) providing the basis for comparative analysis between the three countries.
2) As part of the SELFCITY project the research team has organised 9 workshops between March 14th 2016 and 17th November 2016 (details in table 1). These workshops were organised in the following ways:
? Action learning cycle workshops worked with groups of participants from the partner groups. These workshops typically took place over 2-3 hours. Together with the SELFCITY facilitators the aim of these workshops was to develop a learning intervention for the group. The learning intervention was to focus on particular learning priorities that the group identified. Although there was some degree of attrition the idea of the learning groups was that they retained a common membership. 
? Intervention workshops - the learning groups established a (or several) learning objectives. The aim of the intervention workshop was to provide external (from the SELFCITY team) facilitation and expertise. The participants for these interventions included the learning group but since they were also directed towards learning to network better, invitations for a wider group were made at the suggestions of the core learning group. The workshops on the 22nd and 29th October were planned over 6 hours and were facilitated by a community activist (Chris Church). The third intervention workshop was run by Futerra in Winchester over 3 hours.
The aim for early 2017 is to follow up the intervention workshops to explore what was learnt and how it was implemented (or translated for implementation) in the two groups.
The workshops have enabled participants to think about their priorities for being organised. In both cases the groups decided that networking was a priority for them and the workshops have allowed them the space to challenge why and how networking might be important to them. In addition to this the Winchester group was keen to explore how they frame messages about climate change. In this sense SELFCITY has facilitated a process of 'collective learning' within the groups, provided them with space, time and resources to (re)assess what they are doing, how they are doing it and map out future courses of development/action. In a wider sense it represents a form of co-evolution whereby the groups are supported by the 'external intervention' of the SELFCITY team to produce new knowledge about themselves and how they do things through a process of intra-group reflection.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In terms of Q-Methodology our research will provide useful experience and evidence for how other researchers might use this approach in cross-national research in relation to climate change to identify different attitudes to climate change and associated motivations relating to why and how individuals and groups decide to take action at the local level. In relation to the Action-Learning Cycle this has already shown that the use of a relatively small amount of externally provided resources can help local groups to engage in self-reflection on what they are doing and why, clarifying their objectives and whether they are succeeding in meeting those objectives and how they wish to develop in the future. This will be of use to both local groups but also to external funding bodies who aim to support such groups. 
Given the current emphasis on localism and voluntary action at local level there will be valuable lessons to learn from this in the wider sense that it cannot be assumed that local groups 'come into existence perfectly formed' but may need external some assistance to identify and develop their objectives, how to achieve these and then to reflect on what has been done/achieved and then to reflect on their future development. Thus recognising that local self-organising groups are dynamic bodies is important and that groups may need support, of varying types, at different stages in their development.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9A25C7EC-5D28-4993-9DD8-ECFBC28D86F2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The UK team conducted 56 Q Sort interviews with members of the two climate change groups we are working with.
