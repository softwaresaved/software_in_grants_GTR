It will combine established UK expertise and specifically developed, state-of-the-art analytical capacity in socio-economic and environmental modelling to build a robust environmental policy assessment methodology for the Brazilian FWE nexus in the context of global change. The modelling capacity, skills and knowledge will be transferred to relevant actors in Brazil to enable local academics to continue informing and engaging policymakers through a continued sustainability transition during and beyond the end of this project.

Brazilian society faces significant uncertainty due to two significant global contextual factors. On one hand, global environmental change, due to global unsustainable resource use and greenhouse gas emissions, is highly likely to change weather patterns, which will affect detrimentally the land cover and biodiversity in Brazil, with severe impacts on agriculture. On the other hand, without appropriate policies in place, the Brazilian economy and environment, relying heavily on exports of natural resources for prosperity, can be vulnerable to global economic change, where changes in demand for commodities could lead to either environmental degradation and large scale land-use change, or decreased wealth and employment. Both types of changes are likely to impact and create intricate complexities in the Brazilian FWE nexus. These transformations and forces must be understood in order to minimise detrimental impacts to welfare and the environment in Brazil. 

Building on past experience and on a partnership with Brazilian academics established through our current EPSRC-CONFAP networking grant for research team building on the FWE nexus (EP/N002504/1), this project will produce a unique contribution to achieve these objectives by using a combination of state-of-the-art detailed multi-scale modelling of the coupled energy-economy-land-use-climate global system, linked to cutting-edge environmental policy and law expertise to effectively inform modelling activities of workable policy frameworks. The ultimate goal is to transfer both types of knowledge and capacity to relevant academic and non-academic actors in Brazil.

Sustainability practices can be influenced by policy; however policy can have unexpected and unintended impacts. In order to effectively promote a sustainability transition, the policy process and cycle must be actively engaged with well-informed actors. This project will combine cutting-edge UK and Brazilian expertise in environmental policy and law with our state-of-the-art, detailed environmental policy modelling capacity to engage the Brazilian policy process in order to significantly improve policy-maker foresight and ultimately the resilience of Brazilian society to possible future global environmental and economic change through a sustainability transition.

Finally, civil society and communities can be guided by sustainability projects that demonstrate best practice, exercises that can be scaled up and replicated. Building on previous successful experience of our Brazil-based team (the REGSA and JELARE projects), this project will also involve setting up small-scale sustainability demonstration and awareness-raising projects in order to show best-practice in each case and engage with the public. This will include a 'sustainable forest' project related to farming practices at the UNISUL university experimental farm, an 'energy forest' project related to the generation of sustainable forestry-related energy products, and a 'less hydro' simulation exercise to engage the public in understanding how to increase the resilience of the energy system to water scarcity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The improvement of the resilience of the human-environment system in Brazil can take place through the implementation of effective policy frameworks in collaboration between stakeholders, researchers and policy-makers. Informing policy-making effectively for successfully managing a sustainability transition can take place in different ways: through engagement of the policy sphere by the academic sector, through consultation and engagement of civil society and stakeholders with policy-makers, and through efficient consultancy for governments. The BRIDGE project aims to contribute to build significant capacity in Brazil for each of these, by first developing, through collaborative work, detailed analysis capacity (computational models and skills to use those) that will be transferred to relevant actors in Brazil, in order to maintain analytical capacity beyond the end of this project.

In Brazil, the analytical capacity and skills will be retained by academics and researchers based primarily at UNISUL but also beyond, who will inform and engage with stakeholders, at the local and national government in Brazil, providing a strong evidence base for a sustainability transition in the FWE nexus. Such a transformation requiring to be scientifically informed at every stage, the analysis capacity produced in this project will enable local actors to maintain and improve information supporting the policy cycle and dialogue in Brazil, by UNISUL, beyond the end of this project.

In the UK, modelling capacity and expertise will be transferred to experienced consultants at Cambridge Econometrics, who will integrate the knowledge and methods produced in this project to their main workflow, in order to offer rapid and qualified analysis, with technical support and training, to policy and stakeholders internationally beyond those involved in this project. This approach enables indefinite maintenance and improvement of models and knowledge produced in this project, made available for efficient use, at low cost, with significant support, in Brazil and internationally. This knowledge transfer activity will ensure sustainable development of knowledge to arise in this project.

Environmental policy and law experts will provide expertise in order to determine which approach to which policy issue is most likely to lead to successful policy change, in close collaboration with Brazilian partner academics closely engaged with the policy process, who will provide close contact to local and national policy-makers. Such a project setup is more likely to lead to useful and effective policy engagement, in comparison to traditional research-only projects.

Our effective scientific dissemination programme will be a crucial element of the project, translating highly technical information into language that can be understood unambiguously by the public concerning possible environmental or human sustainability issues looming, or potential future detrimental impacts of environmental change lying in the current course of development in Brazil. Our consortium has a strong and established experience at achieving this, for instance with the LINKS2015 (EP/N002504/1), REGSA (http://www.regsa-project.eu) and JELARE (http://www.jelare-project.eu) sustainability and renewables projects.

This project will contribute to the scientific and academic sector with peer-reviewed journal publications as well as accessible open access and open source models and data that can be downloaded. We will offer access to the methods, theory and model components to be used by other academic, private and public research bodies. Open access to scientific output will be crucial for maximising impact: data and papers produced in this project will be made available online. Impact will be obtained through our extensive programme of engagement with Brazilian stakeholders, but also through existing contacts with UK stakeholders and international organisations (e.g. DECC, CCC, UNEP, UNDP).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>578903</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N013174/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19539613-8143-4CD6-B1E5-0C7B93D08B7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural &amp; experimental eco</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E94BED75-343A-47C8-BEA1-E1E927732B34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Land - Atmosphere Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>249FA81B-498A-424B-9C57-C9BC20E4F688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Macroeconomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
