Receptors are embedded in the cell membrane and allow the cell to recognise and respond to specific signals which result in a cellular response. Ion channels and transporters also play a role in controlling the response of cells to stimuli by controlling the flow of ions into and out of the cell. The number and location of these membrane proteins on the cell surface can greatly affect the response of cells to external signals while mis-location of these critical cell surface proteins can give rise to conditions such as diabetes and cystic fibrosis. This project will investigate one mechanism by which cells control the number of membrane proteins on the cell surface. Cells have a number of ways of monitoring and controlling the number and type of membrane proteins on their surface. Proteins carry signal motifs (similar to postal codes) which determine their end location within the cell. Cell surface membrane proteins are synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Many of these proteins carry a set of signals which results in them being held within the cell (primarily the ER) if they fail to form correctly folded proteins. Some membrane proteins also carry another set of signals which aid their exit from the ER and delivery to the cell surface. It is thought that when a protein is folded correctly it has the ability to hide signals that result in it staying within the ER and expose signals that will aid its transport to the correct location within the cell. A general strategy is proposed, proteins synthesised in the ER are transported to the Golgi apparatus by transport vesicles (called COP II vesicles) which bud off from the ER and fuse with the Golgi apparatus. If the proteins carried in these vesicles are incorrectly folded and have an uncovered ER retention signal / motif they are then placed in different transport vesicles (COPI vesicles) and returned to the ER. If the proteins are destined to reach the cell surface they must conceal their retention motifs. Masking of retention motifs occurs through correct folding of the membrane proteins and interaction with additional proteins. We have previously demonstrated that ER retention motifs can be masked by a protein called 14-3-3. To date a group of more than a dozen proteins have been shown to require 14 3 3 to allow them move out of the ER. This project will examine the mechanism by which 14-3-3 helps proteins reach their correct location on the cell surface. Many questions remain to be answered, including does 14-3-3 bind to and mask the ER retention signals on membrane proteins only at the ER or does it travel with the membrane protein all the way to the cell surface. If 14-3-3 does travel all the way to the surface does it have an effect there? Or is the role of 14-3-3 to make it easier or faster for cell surface membrane proteins to reach thier destinations? Do other proteins also help membrane proteins make their way to the cell surface? As 14-3-3 appears to help membrane proteins get to the cell surface, if we can determine conditions which help 14-3-3 interact with these proteins we can increase the number of proteins on the cell surface. Similarly we could also prevent the interaction and reduce the number of membrane proteins reaching the surface. As membrane proteins are critical to the functioning of cells a mechanism by which we can control their number on the cell surface would provide a means to alter cell function in health and disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cell surface expression of integral membrane proteins proceeds under tight control. This regulation enables the cell to monitor the quality of multimeric complexes produced, maintain stable expression levels of critical membrane proteins and as a result respond to stimuli in an appropriate manner. Intrinsic signal sequences are among the quality control mechanisms which mediate the transit of proteins through the secretory pathway. Arginine-based signals (RR or RXR) found in the cytoplasmic domains of an array of membrane proteins are recognised by coatomer (COPI) vesicle coat proteins which are implicated in ER retention / retrieval. Masking of the retention motifs is the probable means of overcoming ER retention. We demonstrate that 14-3-3 (a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic family of adaptor proteins) has the ability to overcome ER retention. By interacting with target membrane proteins 14-3-3 displaces COPI interaction enabling forward transport. Many of the retained membrane proteins demonstrate a phosphorylation dependence on 14-3-3 interaction. Whilst the basic mechanism of 14-3-3-dependent forward transport has been uncovered, our knowledge of the exact processes which occur is limited. Using K2P3 as a model protein (a background K+ channel used in our initial studies) this proposal will elucidate fundamental aspects of this 14-3-3 dependent forward transport pathway. We will (i) determine the mechanism of 14-3-3-dependent forward transport and elucidate if the role of 14-3-3 is limited to ER release or is involved in the kinetics of membrane protein turnover (ii) determine if 14-3-3 plays a role in recruitment of additional modulatory proteins that aid in the forward transport of membrane proteins and (iii) determine the protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) responsible for phosphorylation dependent modification of 14-3-3 interaction and in so doing determine a physiologically relevant control of cell surface expression of key membrane proteins.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>265437</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk to GCSE students at local college</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C254DB41-C09E-4852-A5A2-A2D9F1C6A8E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This talk at a local college always instigates requests for more information, requests to visit the lab or department and requests for advise on research projects for their extended reports

The first was to determine the mechanism of 14-3-3 dependent forward transport and was achieved by initially determining the endoplasmic reticulum as the cellular location for initial interaction between 14-3-3 and K2P channels. 

The extent of 'chaperoning' performed by 14-3-3 as the K2P channels transit to the cell surface was also examined. The transit of wild-type channels compared to channel mutants which were unable to interact with 14-3-3 was studied. Together these studies provided good insight into the role played by 14-3-3 in terms of rate of forward transport and ability to exit the endoplasmic reticulum

The second objective was to identify constitutive components within the pathway and these studies provided insight into the role of auxiliary proteins in K2P channel forward transport. Our findings demonstrate that 14-3-3 is key to recruitment of other chaperone proteins. The work also determined the stoichiometry of 14-3-3 binding to the channel dimer and demonstrated that a single 14-3-3 molecule was sufficient to enable channel forward transport. (In preparation for publication).

The final objective was to determine the kinase responsible for channel phosphorylation. This was identified as Protein kinase A and studies are on-going to determine the phosphatases which target channel dephosphorylation</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. The work demonstrated that while other auxiliary proteins may modulate the targeting of membrane proteins through this forward transport pathway, the recruitment of other proteins is dependent on 14-3-3. This is significant in not only understanding the critical components of the pathway but also in clarifying apparent discrepancies in publications within the field. (O'Kelly &amp;amp; Goldstein, 2008)

2. Protein kinase A was identified as the key kinase responsible for phosphorylating the c-terminal serine on the K2P channels critical to 14-3-3 recruitment (Mant et al., 2011). This is significant in not only advancing our knowledge of the novel forward transport pathway but also provides a molecular tool by which cell surface expression of these important channels can be dynamically regulated.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>68EEFE51-10A1-4E6E-B940-93B5124364AA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/12DBF55E-50FD-45EC-8B23-81A4A0B2D6F4"><gtr:id>12DBF55E-50FD-45EC-8B23-81A4A0B2D6F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protein kinase A is central for forward transport of two-pore domain potassium channels K2P3.1 and K2P9.1.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a0474ae5e3d82c50153d1d982d4c3f42"><gtr:id>a0474ae5e3d82c50153d1d982d4c3f42</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mant A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9B7283D2-D321-4BB9-91B5-6468C45A819F"><gtr:id>9B7283D2-D321-4BB9-91B5-6468C45A819F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protein Kinase A (PKA) is central for the forward transport of two-pore domain K+ channels K2P3.1 and K2P9.1</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/30d61520032777d993aafdf0a22b84bd"><gtr:id>30d61520032777d993aafdf0a22b84bd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ita O'Kelly (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/17909316-5302-4D0D-9A1F-5C829CC5EC14"><gtr:id>17909316-5302-4D0D-9A1F-5C829CC5EC14</gtr:id><gtr:title>N-glycosylation-dependent control of functional expression of background potassium channels K2P3.1 and K2P9.1.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a0474ae5e3d82c50153d1d982d4c3f42"><gtr:id>a0474ae5e3d82c50153d1d982d4c3f42</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mant A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E014453/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>DFBE2CDD-52E2-4421-882F-9A7323BC308A</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>BB/E014453/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>401580.29</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2007-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2008-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>36B31E71-B92A-4CAA-8DAD-27EA4C35D118</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>BB/E014453/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>265437.62</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2009-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
