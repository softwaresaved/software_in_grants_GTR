The review began with an expert advisory panel meeting, followed by a collaborative workshop between panel members, historic environment sector professionals who undertake engagement programmes, and participants who take part in engagement projects (see Appendix 1 for a list of contributors and notes). Two additional internal workshops were held at the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS), to gather experiences and information from staff. The fourth and final element has been the writing of a discussion paper, based on a review of the literature and the assessment of engagement examples, including six case studies. The full discussion paper draws out and explores various issues from past experience of engagement. These issues include constant and on-going funding problems, institutional processes that affect projects, inward-facing attitudes by some professionals in the heritage sector, and technological advances that can help people engage with aspects of the historic environment. It is intended that the discussion paper will be submitted to the International Journal of Heritage Studies for publication (Hale forthcoming). This research review is a short summary of the full discussion paper.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Convened expert panel</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>30562002-39DD-4932-90DA-E30D705119CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop aimed to discuss good practices, challenging experiences and potential future directions for engagement projects by combining facilitators, from across the heritage spectrum, with experts and participants from community engagement projects. This workshop aimed to be an example of cross-partnership, broad-sector working. It was hoped that by linking facilitators, from different heritage institutions, with public participants, a broad range of experiences would be discussed and the results form part of the LCHE recommendations for good-practice, challenges and future directions.

Workshops within the institution were delivered in a new approach.
