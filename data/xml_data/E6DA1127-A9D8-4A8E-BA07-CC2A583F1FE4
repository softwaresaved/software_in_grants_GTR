accelerator</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/R004781/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This five-year Prosperity Partnership programme will build upon and deepen the successful relationship that exists between the University of Exeter and QinetiQ. We will develop advanced materials that can be used to control and manipulate the propagation of electromagnetic and acoustic energy in a highly tailored, bespoke fashion, and develop innovative techniques for their cost-effective manufacture.
Materials that have the ability to fully control and manipulate the flow of electromagnetic (e.g. radiated heat, light, radiowaves) and acoustic (e.g. sound, vibration, shock) energy have the potential to transform, and enable, a large and diverse range of technologies. Exeter and QinetiQ have long been at the forefront of the science and engineering of such materials, with recent examples being: the modification of wind turbines to reduce their interference with meteorological and aviation radar systems, where half of the viable wind-farm sites in the UK are currently blocked for this reason, and the development of new optoelectronic materials for the realisation of beyond ultra-high definition displays.
However, there are still significant challenges prohibiting the widespread take up of these new materials in applications. In particular, concepts developed in the laboratory are often incompatible with commercial manufacture, due to their complexity and the nature of the constituent parts. Instead, the basic science that describes the behaviour of these new materials needs to be combined with a detailed understanding of how such materials could be manufactured, so that new materials can be designed and engineered to tackle specific technological challenges using commercially viable approaches. The objective of this Partnership is to bring together leading advanced materials and manufacturing research at Exeter and QinetiQ to address real technology and innovation challenges.
Through the exchange of staff, the shared used of facilities and an emphasis on the training of a new generation of entrepreneurial researchers, we will work across conventional discipline and institutional boundaries to accelerate the impact of academic research. The outcome of the programme will be a sustainable, long term partnership, underpinned by revenue created through the creation of products, or the licensing of intellectual property. The resulting research and technology pipeline will underpin future innovation, leading to the creation of additional high tech UK jobs and economic impact through spin-outs and joint ventures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The TEAM-A Prosperity Partnership will positively impact UK economic success. The research and technology pipeline created by the Partnership will not only support QinetiQ in its core defence and security business, but will allow further diversification into new non-defence markets, such as renewable energy, via dual-use technologies. QinetiQ is one of the largest UK science and technology based companies, and a top 50 UK employer of science, research, engineering &amp;amp; technology professionals. The potential within TEAM-A is exemplified by project 2.1 on Tailored Infra-red sources. There is a quantified opportunity to develop a versatile and secure market leading solution for an IR beacon, which will enable an aircraft to identify a vehicle as friendly with eight times the capability of its nearest rival. The first round of supply to the market for this technology is estimated to be worth &amp;pound;250m and commercialising a solution would deliver &amp;pound;200million of international sales into UK Plc. However, versions of the same sources could be used for infrared gas sensing, which accounts for 20% of the ~&amp;pound;1billion market for industrial gas sensors.

The Partnership will help support a wide range of high tech UK SMEs, who often play a critical part in the exploitation of UK science and technology. Companies such as; LabGenius, APL, Tiflex, Imerys, Innovia and The Quartz Corp have given commitment to TEAM-A and the SME network and broader industry engagement will accelerate as the projects progress. Specifically, SME's will have access to targeted academic research and development at an early stage in its evolution, often addressing specific questions raised by the SME's themselves. At a later stage new applications will be developed that will be licensed to SME's for exploitation and business growth

The UK economy will further benefit by a strengthening of the South and South West region's international position in advanced engineering, as highlighted in the recent governt science and innovation audit. Key unique capabilities in advanced engineering, including aerospace, composites, renewable energy and automotive all stand to benefit from focussed research into advanced materials. Within the South West &amp;amp; South Wales 98,000 people are currently employed in aerospace and advanced engineering and this rapidly expanding area has generated growth of 29% over the last five years, more than twice the average regional growth rate. These sectors provide significant Gross Value Added to the UK economy and TEAM-A will add to this by enabling an optimisation of manufacturing and take up of these new materials.

The focus on outreach and education at all levels within TEAM-A will address urgent capability gaps including the requirement for an additional 2,500 employees (within the South West) in advanced engineering over the next ten years. By delivering high value jobs, skills and innovation within these fields TEAM-A will also deliver productivity growth and the programme will link in with the Local Enterprise Partnership plans to address the productivity gap; productivity in the South West is 86% of the UK average. Increasing productivity to the national average would add &amp;pound;11,000 per head to local salaries, significantly improving quality of life and inward investment within the region. The Partnership will train a new generation of leading researchers equipped with the entrepreneurial skills to take science from the laboratory to the market.

Engagement with schools and community groups will have impact beyond those directly aiming to pursue careers in this sector. A wider public will benefit by gaining increased scientific understanding in tangible and meaningful ways, through exposure to accessible advanced engineering concepts and prototypes. Outreach and engagement work will increase public engagement and enthusiasm alongside knowledge in this area, a long term benefit in an increasingly advanced employment market.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2433194</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R004781/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
