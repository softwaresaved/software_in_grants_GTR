for mental illness into chronic disease care (Project MIND)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/M014290/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Integrating mental health care into primary health care services could reduce the impact of both chronic communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Like many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), South Africa (SA) faces the challenge of how to reduce the high prevalence and impact of communicable diseases and NCDs, including mental disorders where limited services are available. Mental disorders are important to address among patients with chronic diseases as these problems are associated with poor adherence to treatment, more rapid disease progression and treatment failure. As treatment failure increases the use of health services and health service costs, chronic disease care in LMICs must be expanded to include mental health care. The integrated delivery of mental health services and chronic disease care has been shown to not only improve access to mental health care but also the mental health of patients living with a chronic disease. . 

Yet, limited knowledge of how mental health care can be integrated into chronic disease services in ways that are acceptable to patients and providers and feasible to implement with few resources has delayed the integration of services in SA. The provision of integrated mental health and chronic disease services has also been delayed by questions about whether services should be vertically or horizontally integrated. Vertically integrated services are delivered at the same location, but mental health and chronic disease services are provided by separate cadres of health workers. Horizontally integrated services are delivered at the same location by the same staff are responsible for mental health and chronic disease care. The goal of this project is to answer these questions by assessing current capacity and barriers to integrating mental health services into chronic disease care and by comparing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a vertically and horizontally integrated model of service integration among patients receiving treatment for HIV or diabetes and who are at risk for treatment failure in Cape Town, SA. Through this project we hope to identify a feasible, acceptable and effective model for integrating mental health services into chronic disease care that is applicable to other LMICs. Findings from this study are likely to be highly relevant for use in other LMICs given similarities between the burden of disease, treatment populations, and treatment systems in SA and other LMICs.

The study will comprise two phases. In the first phase, we will conduct in-depth interviews with a range of healthcare providers in HIV and diabetes services to assess barriers to integration and the feasibility and acceptability of our proposed models of service integration (Aim 1). Findings from this phase will be used to adapt our evidence-based mental health service package for optimal integration into chronic disease services. In phase two, a clustered randomised controlled trial will be conducted. We will select 24 HIV and 24 diabetes clinics to randomise to a vertically integrated arm, horizontally integrated arm, or treatment as usual (no integration). We will recruit 25 patients at risk for treatment failure from each of these clinics (total 1200 patients). After study enrollment, a baseline assessment will be completed by a fieldworker. Participants recruited from clinics randomised to either the vertically integrated or horizontally integrated arm will then receive their intervention sessions. All participants, irrespective of their intervention arm, will be tracked for 6- and 12-month follow-up interviews. At these interviews, fieldworkers blinded to their intervention arm will re-administer the baseline assessment and biological specimens will be collected to assess for chronic disease outcomes. Findings from this phase will be used to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of our proposed models of service integration (Aims 2-3).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: The integrated delivery of chronic disease and mental health services has been shown to improve access to mental health care and patient disease outcomes in low and middle income countries, such as South Africa. Yet integration has been slow due to limited knowledge of feasible, acceptable and effective collaborative care models. We propose addressing this knowledge gap by testing collaborative care models for patients at risk of treatment failure in Cape Town. 
Objectives:
1. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a vertical and horizontal model for integrating mental health care into HIV and diabetes services.
2. To compare the effectiveness of a vertical model of service integration relative to a horizontal model relative to treatment as usual (TAU), with depression and risky alcohol use as primary outcomes and HIV1 RNA viral load and HbA1c as secondary outcomes.
3. To determine the cost-effectiveness of a vertical model of service integration relative to a horizontal model relative to TAU.
Methods:
Interviews will be conducted with HIV and diabetes service providers to assess barriers to integration and the feasibility and acceptability of our proposed models of service integration (Aim 1). Findings will be used to adapt our mental health package for optimal integration. Next we will conduct a clustered randomised controlled trial in which 24 HIV and 24 diabetes clinics will be allocated to a vertically integrated, horizontally integrated, or treatment as usual (no integration) arm. We will recruit 25 patients at risk for treatment failure from each clinic (total 1200) and administer a baseline assessment. Participants in the vertically integrated and horizontally integrated arms will receive their intervention sessions. Participants will return to the clinic for 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Findings will be used to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the proposed models of service integration (Aims 2-3).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study will provide new, internationally relevant knowledge of how to better integrate mental health services into chronic disease care within resource-limited health systems. The existing knowledge base is insufficient for guiding evidence-based service design as there are questions about whether services should be vertically or horizontally integrated. Vertically integrated services are co-located to allow for referral between condition-specific services. However, each service is delivered by its own dedicated work force (12-13). In contrast, horizontally integrated services are functionally merged with some chronic disease staff designated to provide mental health care alongside chronic disease care (12-13). Both models require staff to be trained and supervised by mental health specialists. While the merits of each model have been outlined (12-13), the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these models for mental health and chronic disease outcomes has not been examined. We propose a developmental study, effectiveness trial, and cost-effectiveness analysis to identify the most feasible, acceptable and efficient model for integrating a novel, generic mental health care package into communicable disease and NCD services. If positive outcomes are achieved in both service settings, we would have identified an approach to mental health service delivery with potential applicability across a range of chronic disease services. Findings may aid efforts to improve the delivery of integrated mental health and chronic disease services in SA. Further, the lessons learned could benefit other LMICs. As SA faces a quadruple burden of communicable diseases, NCDs, injury and mental disorders (1), it provides a laboratory for health system interventions that are potentially useful for other LMICs engaging in epidemiological transitions.

Second, this study will have an economic and societal impact. Healthcare personnel will benefit by learning how to address mental disorders among chronic disease patients and will be able to help enhance their patients' health and quality of life. This study will empower healthcare personnel to identify and address mental disorders that contribute to treatment failure by providing staff with evidence-based screening and intervention tools. Implementing either of these two models of integrated service delivery may increase the availability of mental health care within the public health system. Providing mental health services within chronic disease care could benefit the health system by reducing the burden placed on these services by patients with poor responses to treatment, who often require more expensive and intensive treatments (10). Also, study participants in both intervention arms are likely to benefit from these mental health services, which may improve the quality of their own and their family's lives. Finally, the knowledge generated by this study will be of direct relevance to current efforts to reform the public health system in SA and many other LMICs where there is a focus on expanding access to mental health care. The WCDOH also is likely to benefit from this study. The WCDOH has prioritised the provision of mental health care to chronic disease patients in its service delivery plans. Should the study find that one model of integrated care is more cost-effective than another; the WCDOH is likely to adopt this model of care and conduct a wider, pragmatic evaluation of its effects on health service delivery. In addition, the WCDOH will use these findings to influence regional and national health policies and legislation, with a view to strengthening the provision of mental health care within SA's public health system. We will also try and influence international health guidelines through disseminating findings to our World Health Organisation contacts and other international networks. As such, results could have a far-reaching impact on public health for similar LMICs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>898776</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Western Cape Department of Health chronic disease working group meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1443245F-9059-46F6-9190-D67159223BA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We attended and presented findings from phase one and plans for phase 2 at this meeting in September 2016.
