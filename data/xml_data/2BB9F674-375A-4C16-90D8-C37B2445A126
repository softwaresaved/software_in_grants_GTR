Compared to carbon, silicon has a much higher energy density and has been the focus of considerable research effort in recent years, stimulating the formation of high-profile, high-investment university spin-out companies such as Amprius and Nexeon. Silicon is the second most abundant element in the earth's crust and is thus a sustainable battery material candidate from a cost and availability perspective. However, despite its desirable properties for Li-ion batteries, it is also renowned for its drawbacks, namely large volume expansion, pulverisation and continued lithium loss through chemical reactions with the electrolyte (which the lithium ions diffuse in). Such phenomena have hindered the successful widespread uptake of this material in commercial Li-ion batteries, despite the myriad of global research groups working on finding ways to make it viable, e.g. by nano-structuring. 

Project AMorpheuS presents an alternative way to fabricate Si anodes that does not rely on complex, costly nanostructuring or attempting to control electrode architectures. The approach is simply to deposit from solution using electrodeposition methods and to passivate the amorphous thin films with polymer chemistries that have already been shown to be effective as binders for Si electrodes. A fundamental understanding of the structural and surface properties of these electrodes will be obtained during realistic battery operation so as to identify the optimum Si alloy and polymer chemistry and optimise performance rationally. This project will develop Si electrodes that are not exclusively destined for use in Li-ion systems but can also be reversibly cycled in Na-ion and Li-S batteries. A variety of Si-alloy chemistries will be explored, including Si-Sn alloys, since these show considerable promise as anodes for Na-ion batteries. A goal is to develop the first Si-based Na anode. 
 
This flexibility opens up numerous technology transfer opportunities in a variety of emerging battery systems focused on higher energy, sustainable, and safer technologies (e.g. Li-ion, Na-ion and LiS, respectively). The new batteries will be tested in the UK's first full battery prototyping line in a non-commercial environment. 

Fully understanding what occurs in a battery as it is charged / discharged is complex. The battery is a closed system with constantly changing domains. Central to the success of this project is the application of in-situ characterisation techniques for analysing real-time, dynamic structural and surface changes that occur as Li ions pass back and forth between the anode and cathode (or why they do not). This knowledge will subsequently guide continued improvements in electrode designs. The major techniques proposed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry occurring in the battery as it is charged/discharged are multinuclear NMR and X-ray computed tomography. These techniques have provided battery researchers with a wealth of vital, real-time insight - especially regarding failure mechanisms in silicon materials. 

Project AMorpheuS's approach will reduce the need for additional processing of materials in the electrodes, e.g., (i) high surface area carbons (which need energy-intense mixing processes) and (ii) industry-standard binders (which require toxic solvents to enable them to be processed into coatings). This strategy will reduce production time and eliminate toxic chemicals. These improvements will significantly reduce manufacturing cost and increase the UK's energy security.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>AMorpheuS will prepare a novel amorphous Si-alloy anode with inherent degradation resistance that can be deployed in a number of Li-ion &amp;amp; beyond- Li-ion battery types and will positively impact the UK's &amp;quot;Energy Trilemma&amp;quot; around cost, environmental concerns and energy security.

The demand for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has grown significantly since 1991, increases in Li consumption having grown at a rate of ca. 22% per annum since 2000. Despite its maturity in portable electronics, analysts foresee a continued boom in sales revenues across all industry sectors, from consumer electronics and EVs to grid storage. More recently, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have gained recognition as promising candidates for next-generation, large-scale energy storage systems. Unlike Li, sodium is an abundant and inexpensive element that shares many properties with Li as an energy storage material. This means that Na-ion batteries can be successfully developed using approaches previously used with LIBs and represent a more sustainable technology than Li. LiS systems are also gaining more attention, having demonstrated higher energy density than LiCoO2-graphite LIBs, and show great potential for transport applications. The ability to inexpensively develop, at scale, an anode that could be used in all of these types of battery will simplify manufacturing routes and stimulate growth within the UK.
 
Society: Energy production and storage are now central paradigms to our quality of life. The traditional grid system (macrogrid) is costly, inefficient and carries risks of localized incidents being able to disturb the &amp;quot;whole&amp;quot;. Microgrids, on the other hand, are obviously smaller and combine power generation, load management and energy storage assets - all controlled in a coordinated network. Having the ability to locally store renewable solar energy, for example, will significantly impact domestic energy costs and reduce issues relating to intermittency.

Environment: Legislation-driven goals such as the EU's 20-20-20 strategy are striving for a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 20% increase energy efficiency, and a 20% increase in renewable energy systems by 2020. This project can deliver in all three of these areas. According to the IEA's Energy Technology Perspectives scenario, PV-harnessed energy is forecast to save 30 Gt of potential CO2 emissions by 2050, and the capability to incorporate longer-lasting, efficient energy storage into renewable energy technologies is essential for this to be achieved. By eliminating the need to use conventional anode components such as conductive additives and polymer binder systems, there will be a reduction in the use of toxic battery solvents such as N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), a known teratogen.

Economy: The market for energy storage on the grid (ESG) alone is forecast to surpass $30bn by 2022. Long duration energy storage by advanced batteries will multiply the technology options available to make this viable. Considerable market opportunities also exist in the transport and portable electronics sectors. Technology transfer and commercial exploitation of this research to produce a new range of longer-lasting, higher energy density batteries, (with better design-through-innovation manufacturing) would create market share and generate significant economic benefits for the UK in these three areas. 

Knowledge: New understanding of the structural dynamics and surface evolution established in novel a-Si anodes for several competing battery technologies. New approaches in electrode fabrication will generate degradation-resistant anodes and develop and disseminate expertise. Advancing knowledge within electrodeposition will allow exploitation possibilities not only in energy storage but within surface science innovations for other research areas, e.g. corrosion inhibition. Technology transfer opportunities exist with UK battery companies such as Sharp, Faradion, QinetiQ, JLR and Oxis Energy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>942389</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>De Montfort University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Catapult High Value Manufacturing Fellowship awarded to De Montfort University to support AMorpheus</gtr:description><gtr:id>105620B5-5833-448E-9294-D40F49C0FA26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications underway, additional EPSRC funding applications to extend the work beyond the Fellowship.

? Electrodeposition of Sn and Sn-Graphene films on copper carried out from a commercially available acidic solution leads to continuous Sn films composed of different intermetallic CuSn alloys.
? The Sn and Sn-Graphene films tested in coin cells display a strong capacity loss after the first 10 cycles.
? Films of amorphous silicon electrodeposited in organic solvents (focusing in particular on propylene carbonate) displayed very low chemical stability, highlighting that organic solvents are not suitable to deposit stable films.
? Electrodeposition of SiSn alloys has been attempted in different organic solvents such as THF, PC, EC and different mixtures as suggested in the literature. However, dissolving both silicon and tin precursors in a common solvent is not possible (even with heat).
? Amorphous silicon was electrodeposited from 1-methyl-1-butylpyrrolidinium bis (trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide ionic liquids and SiCl4. 
? The films were amorphous with a thickness between 200 nm and 1 micron. A study of the effect of temperature on the morphology and composition of the films showed that, apart from increased film thickness, no other differential features were observed. 
? Rinsing of the sample was challenging due to the very low vapour tension of the IL, different solvent combinations were investigated to find the better solution which was dimethyl carbonate and acetone rinsing.
? Coin cells integrating silicon films were displayed poor capacity.
? Electrodeposition of SiSn films is currently underway from the ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidiniumtrifluoromethanesulfonate.

AMorpheus (3) - Raman spectroscopy, 3D-X Ray imaging and Neutron diffraction techniques have been used to study thin films of Sn, Sn-Ni, Si, Sn-G, Sn-Si and graphite:
3.1-&amp;nbsp; Raman spectroscopy 
o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sn- and Si-based samples do not show useful Raman activity.
o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The graphene layer on the Sn-G samples shows the characteristic G peak, as well as small D and 2D peaks.&amp;nbsp; Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique to confirm the nature of the deposited carbon layer.
o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The change in the Raman shift on electrochemical insertion of lithium into the Sn-G deposit is being studied.
3.2-&amp;nbsp; 3D-X Ray imaging
o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Initial 3D-X Ray imaging of Sn-G successfully differentiated between the graphene layer and the Sn/Cu, however, the Sn and Cu could not be differentiated using the relatively low beam power.&amp;nbsp; Future scans will employ a combination of two scans, one at low power, which will show the graphene, and one at high power, which will aim to differentiate the Sn base layer from the copper current collector.
3.3.- Progress in Neutron imaging is described in Use of facilities, as the experiments have been performed at neutron facilities in UK and Germany.


AMorpheus (4) - liquid and ssNMR spectroscopy and SEM, have been used to study the morphology of Si films after cycling at 1, 2, 6, 30 and 50 cycles as well as the composition of soluble and insoluble products of decomposition of the electrolyte. 
-While fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is a well-established additive to enhance cycle life, the reasons behind the enhanced performance are not fully understood. A key finding of AMorpheous is that the Solid-Electrolyte Interface (SEI) layer formed on Silicon anodes (both nanoparticles mixed with CMC binder and carbon as well as additive-free nanowires) in the presence of FEC additive has less soluble decomposition products in the electrolyte, whereas in the absence of FEC, soluble products such as lithium ethylene decarbonate (LEDC), as well as some new unidentified species can be detected (as confirmed through liquid NMR on the solution extracted by washing the cycled separator with deuterated DMSO). The ability of FEC to inhibit the soluble decomposition products can be one of the reason behind the enhanced cycle life in the presence of FEC. Additionally, through gravimetric analysis we find that the weight % increase of electrodes cycled with FEC is much smaller at extended cycles than those electrodes cycled without FEC, which proves that a more effective SEI forms in the FEC electrolyte and the SEI prevents the continuous electrolyte decomposition.
The different electrochemical stability is also due to the differences in the SEI layer morphology and composition that forms and do not dissolve. 1H and 13C ssNMR (solid-state NMR) as well as DNP (Dynamic Nuclear Polarization) experiments has been used to identify the chemical nature of these non-crystalline polymeric species in the SEI. In the presence of FEC, a portion of unsaturated polycarbonate or poly-VC (vinylenecarbonate) type units have been identified which were absent in electrodes cycled without FEC. We are currently investigating the exact chemical structure of the FEC containing electrolyte&amp;acute;s decomposition products. Moreover, top view SEM images of electrodes cycled in the absence of FEC show much more pore clogging than those cycled with FEC. The clogging will hinder the electrolyte diffusion into the electrode, thus limiting their electrochemical performance. 
The identification of critical differences in the morphology and composition of the SEI layer formed on top of Silicon electrodes cycled with and without FEC additives should aid in the design of the artificial SEI layer, which is also one of the objectives of this research project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They will be used to continue the ongoing work on following through the research plan of the proposal.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A2B5C539-F3DA-47CC-AB8B-52034A94FA9E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A modified, purpose-built coin cell was used for operando neutron imaging.
