Both policymaking activities and administrative control are increasingly structured around calculations such as cost-benefit analyses, estimates of social and financial returns, measurements of performance and risk, benchmarking, quantified impact assessments, ratings and rankings, all of which provide information in the form of a numerical representation. Through quantification, public services have experienced a fundamental transformation from &amp;quot;government by rules&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;governance by numbers&amp;quot;, with fundamental implications not just for our understanding of the nature of public service itself, but also for wider debates about the nature of citizenship and democracy. This project scrutinizes the relationships between quantification, administrative capacity and democracy across three policy sectors (health/hospitals, higher education/universities, criminal justice/prisons) and four countries (France, Germany, Netherlands, UK). It offers a cross-national and cross-sectoral study of how managerialist ideas and instruments of quantification have been adopted and how they mattered. More specifically, it examines (i) how quantification has travelled across sectors and states; (ii) relations between quantification and
administrative capacity; and (iii) how quantification has redefined relations between public service and liberal democratic understandings of public welfare, notions of citizenship, equity, accountability and legitimacy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will deliver leading international research on one of the most pressing questions in the world of research and practice, namely the future of the control of public services. Apart from academic papers, a joint research volume and policy briefings, this project will deliver (i) a comprehensive cross-sectoral and cross-national database to indicate the spread of quantification in the three sectors and four countries, (ii) a comprehensive record of the consequences of quantification and economization on the public services, and (iii) a framework to assess administrative capacities in an age of quantification and economization.
There are three beneficiaries from this study:

- Academic researchers and students: The study will produce a range of research outputs for high-level international publications, a joint volume with an international press, and working papers contributing to the international and cross-disciplinary literature on the governance of public services. The outputs will be of particular relevance given the novel approach of this study, namely its bringing together of different disciplinary concerns, its cross-sectoral and cross-national perspective, and its direct relevance to contemporary debates on the governance of public services. 

- Opinion-shapers: The study will directly engage and interact with opinion-shapers. The study's research, and its outputs are of direct relevance to debates about the future shape of public services, and the ways in which new forms of delivery can be controlled and regulated. The project will produce special practice-oriented outputs, such as policy briefs, and hold practice-oriented seminars to engage directly with opinion-shapers across all four jurisdictions. Particular emphasis will be on bringing together the different opinion-shapers in the different sectors to expose them to similarities and differences across sectors and jurisdictions. 

- Practitioners: The study is of direct relevance to those involved in the control of public services as it offers a much-needed comparative analysis of an important trend in contemporary governance. To maximize the impact in the world of practice, the research will be initiated, conducted and finalized in close interaction with the world of practice, e.g. by using CARR's visiting fellows and policy advisory group, as well as other international experts to comment on and discuss emerging findings. We will integrate practitioner contributions during group research meetings, and hold practitioner-related seminars as well as publish policy briefs throughout the project. We will co-operate with LSE's Institute for Public Affairs to maximize impact. We will work with the Leiden University Campus in The Hague to connect directly with top-level public administrators in the national government in the Netherlands.

To facilitate knowledge exchange and engagement, we will further establish an advisory committee consisting of members from all three beneficiary groups. Initial members (confirmed) are Kai Wegrich (Hertie School of Governance Berlin), Jeremy Lonsdale (RAND Corporation UK), Philippe Bezes (CNRS-CERSA, France), Sandra Resodihardjo (Radboud, Netherlands), Christiane Arndt (OECD) and J&amp;uuml;rgen Weber (WHU Otto Beisheim School of Management, Germany).

To support the dissemination of findings the project's website makes publicly available all working papers, policy briefings, and short web-video films.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>473105</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk/debate at General Medical Council (GMC)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B9190753-48CD-4BEE-A796-189B2996A600</gtr:id><gtr:impact>QUAD (Quantification, Administrative Capacity and Democracy) Research Officer Alex Griffiths gave a presentation to the General Medical Council's (GMC) Regulatory Development and Intelligence teams covering the use of quantified data in a regulatory environment and gave advice on the use of analytics to model high risk doctors based on the research conducted in the context of the QUAD project and his earlier PhD work.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Quantification in Crisis&quot; (Workshop organised at the LSE in collaboration with the French IFRIS Seminar Series &quot;The shaping and government of crises&quot;)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8CD85CA8-BBCF-4D2F-9046-BA191D9A5499</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An international workshop organised at the LSE to debate the roles of quantification in the governance of economy and society.

However, as the project is only nearing the end of its first year (out of 3 years), impact is only beginning to emerge. As part of the project, this project's full-time research officer (Alex Griffiths) developed a hospital care quality indicator based on an analysis of patient commentaries on twitter, Facebook and other social media as well as relevant NHS Choice websites (making use of the wisdom of crowds). Initial findings suggest that this indicator has stronger predictive power than the indicators currently in use by the Care Quality Commission (see entry in findings section). Initial presentation of these findings in an informal meeting to representatives from NHS Improvement generated great interest and a request for further information. It was agreed that a more detailed presentation will be given to NHS Improvement later in 2017. Findings will also be presented at CARR's (LSE) Regulators' Forum in March 2017, a forum created by CARR/LSE for knowledge exchange amongst regulators (participating organisations include, inter alia, NHS Improvement, the Care Quality Commission, and representatives from the General Medical Council. It is still too early to say how exactly the findings will be used by the above named bodies, and we will follow this up as the project progresses. However, the initial articulated interest suggests that there is great potential for economic (cost-saving) as well societal impact and impact on public service delivery and policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>66FF8E1E-3C3A-404D-84ED-7EC0A7CE61B4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Please note that this project is still ongoing. The findings reported below can therefore only be regarded as preliminary. More detailed reporting of findings will follow as the project progresses. As part of the project, this project's full-time research officer (Alex Griffiths) developed, amongst other things, a hospital care quality indicator based on an analysis of patient commentaries on twitter, Facebook and other social media as well as relevant NHS Choice websites (making use of the wisdom of crowds, in this case &amp;quot;the wisdom of patients&amp;quot;). Initial findings indicate that this indicator might have stronger predictive power (e.g. with regards to predicting failure in the delivery of high quality care in hospitals) than the hospital care quality ratings assembled by the Care Quality Commission. We are currently in the process of further testing/checking and disseminating the results and are preparing a working paper for peer-reviewed publication.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The above reported findings (the developed hospital care quality indicator on the basis of patient's social media entries and web hospital ratings) might be taken forward by policy-makers, regulators and hospital managers (see also our impact reporting). The developed hospital care quality indicator might be useful for the allocation/rationing of inspection resources (making decisions on hospital inspections, execution of risk-based regulation). The developed hospital care quality indicator may also be useful in aiding patient choice (of hospitals for treatment). We are already in contact with relevant regulators and policy makers and have arranged for presentations to disseminate findings to these audiences (see also our impact reporting). Methodologically the findings are also of interest (both academically and for the purposes of policy making). It is planned to publish/disseminate the results in relevant peer-reviewed academic journals as well as more practitioner-oriented outlets including LSE/CARR's in-house Risk &amp;amp; Regulation magazine (an article for the Risk &amp;amp; Regulation magazine has already been prepared and accepted for publication in Summer 2017).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>93D86412-A684-433A-9138-C8FFDBCBEBE7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B6E05C60-4FCA-4A99-8BB1-26130A4ED347"><gtr:id>B6E05C60-4FCA-4A99-8BB1-26130A4ED347</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantifying, Economising, and Marketising: Democratising the social sphere?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociologie du Travail</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/61d7b745aa259848b1bd7f41ff42fa5e"><gtr:id>61d7b745aa259848b1bd7f41ff42fa5e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kurunm?ki L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N018869/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC53A3F2-81B6-40C9-874D-291D23B3C79F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0E99303-35B5-4458-9B00-D93E2E075C9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Finance and Accounting</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B8E7153C-9FE1-4987-A37B-98408DC227F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public Administration</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
