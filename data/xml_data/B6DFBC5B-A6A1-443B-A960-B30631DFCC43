Despite considerable research into the late 19th and early 20th century decline of fertility in England and Wales, understanding of the origins and evolution of this important social development remains surprisingly limited, mainly because researchers have largely had to rely on published reports (which tabulate figures for large geographic units and give no information on how fertility is distributed among women) or on time-consuming local studies. Now, however, the release of a database of individual-level census returns for the whole of England and Wales for 1851-1911 makes feasible the calculation of age specific fertility measures at 7 points in time for over 2000 registration sub-districts (RSDs), as well as for social classes and occupational groups. Such measures will greatly enhance our knowledge of where, when and at what rate fertility declined, and which groups spearheaded the behaviours which reduced the number of children being born. 
To calculate age-specific fertility rates from the returns of a particular census, the number of children born to women of specific ages in the 5 years before the census is required. The number of children aged under 5 living with their mothers can be identified from the census schedules, but additional data on children born in the 5 years before the census but dying before they could be enumerated have to be included the counts in order to accurately estimate the fertility rates. The numbers of child and infant deaths for each RSD will therefore be collected from the Registrar General's reports, creating a mortality database at unprecedented geographic scale. Other measures contributing to overall fertility will be calculated and mapped, including illegitimacy, children living without both parents, the proportion of the female population who were in their fertile years (15-49), the proportion of these who were married and living with their husband, and an index of age of marriage.
A spatial database of fertility, marriage and early child mortality will be constructed at RSD level, allowing patterns to be mapped and spatially and statistically analysed. The creation of consistent units using spatial interpolation will allow patterns over time to be more clearly seen. The maps will form the basis of the 'Atlas of Fertility Decline', which will also include analysis and explanatory text. Because of the scale used, printed maps will only be able to indicate a 'general' picture so electronic maps will also be devised to enable viewers to zoom in to particular areas to see the patterns and changes over time in greater detail. This will be of particular use when large cities, with different social and economic sectors, are being studied. Online courses will allow interested parties to gain a better understanding of the calculation and interpretation of demographic measures.
Multivariate spatial analysis will be used to investigate the influences affecting fertility, nuptiality and early age mortality, and the results published in leading academic journals. The project will also compare the cross-sectional fertility measures, derived by counting parents and their children in the census returns, with the fertility rates reported retrospectively by married women in the 1911 census.
The Atlas and academic papers will provide very detailed data, allowing the 'big questions' about fertility decline in England and Wales (were the fundamental drivers of decline new forms of knowledge or cultural changes? Did fertility decline spreads mainly through social groups or over geographical space?) to be addressed more thoroughly than ever before.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of the proposed research would be all those seeking to identify pathways to reduced fertility either in historic or present day contexts, or those examining the impact reduced fertility has had on other aspects of society. Those interested in the survival chances of infants and young children in a variety of contexts will also benefit from the research. Researchers from a broad range of fields, including history, the social sciences and health and medicine will be able to consult the datasets, the maps and the text produced to identify spatial or social groups at particular points within the 1851-1911 period which would be most appropriate to study in order to answer the research questions they seek to answer, rather than relying on the more 'piece meal' approaches relied on previously. Those choosing to study particular localities or social groups will have details of the wider demographic and social context of the area or group on which they are focusing readily to hand. 

Groups and individuals studying or wanting to explore local history, but unfamiliar with how to calculate the fertility and child mortality measures, will find these figures already calculated for them, along with indications of particular aspects of their chosen locality which are typical, or atypical, of the wider region in which it sits. Those who wish to find out how to calculate and interpret these measures will be able to follow a massive open online course (mooc) to further their skills and understanding.

The general public will benefit though the availability of a website which will allow interested parties to visually explore the coincidences between socio-economic and demographic measures at a variety of spatial levels, including fine geographic units. This will increase public engagement with research in general, and more particularly provide an accessible way to understand the importance of the historical antecedents of current geographical and social differentials, enhancing the cultural and societal understanding of those using the website.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>585849</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Campop coffee time presentations</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5C568C8-58E1-4489-B682-3C4C0C3E4D77</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the team regularly make presentations tot he Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure (Campop), attended by about 40 people.

Bennett. It meets at Cambridge and aims: (1) to exchange experiences of working with the I-CeM database, which is a core resources for the ESRC project; (2) to identify deficiencies in the data and work towards methods of improvement; (3) to share activities with other researchers that are intended to plug gaps or institute improvements in I-CeM; (4) develop a strategic view of priorities for I-CeM improvements; (5) disseminate improvements and inform other users. This has modified the database in use by the user community and improved everyone's knowledge of the data properties, and its limitations. The working group has a core of membership of 18, with others added on a case by case basis when needed. It involves meetings with Cambridge, Essex and Leicester experts who are using the database. Liaison is also maintained with I-CeM users in Scotland. It met 21 times over 2015 after the data was first recieved in late 2014, leading up to an I-CeM version 2 which became available in January 2016. Most of the detailed work on V.2 was prepared by staff on the Fertility Atlas project. It is available locally at Cambridge as: Sch&amp;uuml;rer, K., Higgs, E., Reid, A.M., Garrett, E.M. (2016) 'Integrated Census Microdata V.2 (I-CeM.2)' [local version]. It will be deposited at UKDA. The group met 4 times in 2016 to receive and digest the version 2 of I-CeM. In 2017 it is working on a version 3. Much activity takes place by the members between meetings. Formal notes are reported and disseminated to group members after each meeting.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar presentation at Essex University History Department, by Alice Reid (PI)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90DDF0AC-1CA4-46BD-B5D3-1426B2481905</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alice Reid was invited to give a Seminar to the Essex University History Department Seminar Series.

It is also enabling the other major ESRC funded project (Drivers of Entrepreneurship) to undertake their research, and will, in due course, enable high quality research by other academic researchers.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>I-CeM version 2</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>GIS boundary files (shape files) containing Registration Sub-District boundaries for England and Wales for 1851.</gtr:description><gtr:id>47C72FFB-6C62-4EFE-81DD-FABA7F3069E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none as yet - only just become available.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Registration Sub-District GIS for England and Wales 1851</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>GIS boundary files (shape files) containing Registration Sub-District boundaries for England and Wales for 1911.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E80E5A54-C982-4BF6-88FD-90EC8A1470D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none as yet - database only recently completed</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Registration Sub-District GIS for England and Wales 1911</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>GIS boundary files (shape files) containing Registration Sub-District boundaries for England and Wales for 1881.</gtr:description><gtr:id>932E1961-FB88-4851-AFB1-216E343C6F99</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none as yet - database only recently completed</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Registration Sub-District GIS for England and Wales 1881</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>GIS boundary files (shape files) containing Registration Sub-District boundaries for England and Wales for 1901.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F3E60413-7D49-4574-BDA3-D3ED2D0C35C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none as yet - database only recently completed</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Registration Sub-District GIS for England and Wales 1901</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>GIS boundary files (shape files) containing Registration Sub-District boundaries for England and Wales for 1851.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0D99F9AD-5704-490B-B262-8C4A09705D51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none as yet - database only just completed</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Registration Sub-District GIS for England and Wales 1861</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L015463/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8785A44-DFE5-4A95-99D0-1A49582F1688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>743BED39-2B13-4A4A-A6DA-806AA3D5A4E7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography/Pop Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp;
