But in recent years, this understanding has been significantly enhanced through exciting scientific breakthroughs. Writers, critics and academics working in the arts and humanities are now turning to new ways of thinking within biosciences, psychology, mathematics, and computer science to reconsider individual and collective memory in literary narratives. At the same time, many scientists acknowledge the benefits of engaging with creative ideas and the ethical and hermeneutic perspectives offered through fiction and humanities methodologies. 
The Memory Network (MN) brings together researchers, authors and organisations to provoke and fuel original ways of thinking about memory. Many important contemporary writers are already in a vibrant dialogue with science and offer crucial starting points for the MN's activity: for example, Ian McEwan's and Will Self's research into neuroscience for Saturday (2005) and The Book of Dave (2006); Margaret Atwood's and Kazuo Ishiguro's thinking about the impact of 'the posthuman' upon human memory; Terry Pratchett's quest to understand the effect on his writing of progressive Alzheimer's; and Hanif Kureishi's interest in understanding how matter and mind are related.
 One of the Network's ambitions is to grow and nurture a community of thinkers interested in cross-disciplinary approaches to memory studies, open to communicating with each other and with the general public. It will also stimulate new creative work and we are particularly keen to actively involve living writers in this community and its various debates. We will encourage a dialogue to develop between the academic community, creative writers and artists, and the general public. Interaction will be encouraged in a number of ways. Firstly, and following an initial symposium called 'The Future of Memory' (funded by the Wellcome Trust), the MN will run a series of free lectures, memory experiments, panel discussions and interactive workshops throughout the first year of the scheme. These events will tackle topics including science and psychogeography, memory, food and phenomenology, memory and new media, memory and prediction, human and artificial intelligence memory, and writing, aging and forgetting. A website called the 'Memory Repository' will support discussion and correspondence between Core Members and the general public in response to these events. Finally, the MN will publish two collaborative works: a 'manifesto' called The Future of Memory: Notes for the New Millennium and an edited collection of essays provisionally titled Memory, Literature and Science.
The Memory Network has literary studies at its core, and most of its initial members are based in English departments with an established or emerging research interest in memory and narrative. In addition, key researchers from other disciplines will join as active members or in an advisory capacity. At present the Network is primarily based in contributors from the UK and North America, but an additional aim for its final phase is to critically situate these interdisciplinary investigations in wider contexts with a European and global emphasis, culminating in a major international conference.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Professionals and Practitioners
Writers and artists will benefit from the MN through being directly involved in the project and through using the various outputs as a source of research and inspiration. Collaboration with colleagues working in different fields (other artists and critics, but especially scientists) should generate a wealth of new ideas that will lead to innovative artistic and cultural activity. Previous collaborative work undertaken by creative writers such as Will Self, A. S. Byatt and Ian McEwan is to be taken as a model here: Self has used his research into work by the Wellcome Trust (Maguire et al.) as the basis for his novel The Book of Dave (2006); Byatt uses her extensive knowledge of memory as the basis of composition of her novels; and McEwan has shadowed a neurosurgeon for his novel Saturday (2005). It is this kind of cross-disciplinary activity which the MN stimulates. 

Wider Public
The MN's various activities will have direct benefits for the general public, bringing a diverse set of high-profile intellectuals into the public sphere, increasing public awareness of the work of, and between, different disciplines in memory studies, and encouraging individuals to engage and interact with cutting-edge research. For example, the inaugural lecture and panel combines the attractions of a hugely popular and critically acclaimed author (A. S. Byatt), an innovative neuroscience researcher (Hugo Spiers), and two world-class literary scholars (Patricia Waugh and Claire Colebrook) who seek to explore the relationship between the arts and sciences. The event with Hugo Spiers and Will Self has already attracted the attention of Channel 4, and we expect Self to be writing about this experience in The Guardian. More intimately, the 'Food, Phenomenology and Memory' event invites members of the public to take part in a food tasting experiment and undergo a live feedback assessment. 'Rewired: Memory, New Media and the Datastate' has the potential to reach a younger audience by featuring young adult author M. T. Anderson.

The Memory Repository website is open for general discussion following on from public events and members of the public can also sign up to a quarterly newsletter detailing the academic network's progress. The whole series of events and complementary online discussion has the potential to bring science and the arts to new audiences in an accessible manner.

Public Sector
The programme of activities will also benefit the various non-profit organisations, institutions and charitable trusts with which the MN is forging relationships. For example, the Museum of London, who are hosting the Science and Psycho-geography event with Hugo Spiers and Will Self, will not only profit from the publicity of this evening but will be put into contact with the core members of the Memory Network for future advisory work. Similar consultancy opportunities will hopefully arise with the Greenwich Observatory, the British Film Institute, the British Library, and the Wellcome Trust. The Alzheimer's Society, the Society of Authors, and the University of the Third Age will also be involved in public events and will benefit in similar ways.

Commercial Private Sector and Media
Many of the public events will generate media interest, not only disseminating ideas to the general public but also stimulating quality journalism. We are expecting that the various contributors will be writing in broadsheets and mainstream opinion magazines such as Prospect and The New Statesman. Venues such as The Blueprint Caf&amp;eacute; will benefit from the short and long term exposure the project generates and may be able to use academic discussion of the event in developing its own corporate identity. Palgrave Macmillan will publish The Future of Memory: Notes for the New Millennium, and the MIT Press have been approached to publish the edited collection, Memory, Literature and Science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35949</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Art, Memory and the Anthropocene</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ECFF21A8-0513-4BD0-9BDC-F9394FADF651</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 80 people from various sections in the country attended the 'Culture, Memory and Extinction' symposium organised by the Forum for European Philosophy held at the National History Museum, London, 4 December, 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://networks.h-net.org/node/8054/discussions/93436/culture-memory-and-extinction-natural-history-museum-london</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Nature of Memory: an interdisciplinary debate</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4FD50904-661B-4D5E-A180-BFC865CAA1D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>29 September, 2015: 'The Nature of Memory', Forum for European Philosophy, London School of Economics, London.

In society, the role of cognition and memory is on various high profile agendas, in the media as well as in public discourse, and the Memory Network's activities have had a substantial influence on these debates, reaching from the impact of the digital world on our social behaviour and on thinking about climate change to changing identities and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's. Within the academe, the Memory Network's modes of connection between disiplines has seen a new wave of interdisciplinary thinking, which are also finding their way into the class room (via new modules on literature/culture and memory, and the brain, for instance) and in a strong appetite for interdisciplinary publications. The Memory Network's influence will be consolidated with the publication of the edited collection 'Memory in the Twenty-first Century' (Palgrave 2015), and the special edition of Memory Studies (2016).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>83B1E140-11AE-4AFB-A2BD-BAC5D101A319</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have discovered that there is a great concern for cognition and, more specifically, memory in our contemporary culture. There are multiplicity of revolutions that together are radically reshaping the context of our thinking about what it means to be a human being in the twenty-first century. Memory is key to understanding these new contexts, which simultaneously reshape our understanding of memory itself. We have explored these concerns through a number of research strands, which together form a mapping of the contemporary human condition. One key concern lies in the ways in which the digital world is reshaping our memory, and our social behaviour and relationships. We have shown that new technologies do not simply entails a loss of cognition and memory, but that it changes the mind and behaviour in complex and subtle ways. In summary, we have found that memory has and is changing, and that it displays the following characteristics:

1. There is a renewed engagement with, and fascination by, the complexities of memory in society;
2. the renewed interest in memory is the result of a new set of complex contexts (including globalisation, climate change, and ageing population) that offer new intellectual challenges;
3. Memories studies has been greatly influenced by the revolutions that neuroscience has brought since the 1960s;
4. Due to the dominance of neuroscience, there is move away from thinking of memory as a collective socio-cultural event and a shift towards the pursuit of memory as processes that take place in the brain, body and mind in individual biological units;
5. the digital revolutions are radically reshaping our memories, sparking much concern from various critics;
6. With the advances of new technologies and (social) media identified above, memory is becoming more and more a collectively shared, extended and distributed activity of archiving and interpretative process between the various users involved in the original experience, its dissemination and reproduction; 
7. Due to the mass availability of technology for common users, the creation and dissemination of memory is democratized through the effects that technology has on our contemporary experience, which includes sharing our experiences through, for instance, social networking sites, apps and other programmes, but also through new techniques such as crowd-sourcing and the algorithmic patterning and analysis of Big Data, which gives the possibility of accessing, mining, analysing the 'wisdom of the crowd'; 
8. Whereas in earlier times remembering was understood as the retrieval of fixed representations events taken place in the past (whereby the integral purity of the original experience is retained), we now understand that memory is our capacity to constantly reorganise information whose understanding is itself determined by contextual association;
9.Due to the ubiquity of technology, we are seeing the creation of 'transactive memory', which is dependent on group cognition;
10. There is a complexification of thinking about the temporality of memory, especially in our conception of thinking how memory related to the future;
11. There is a new emphasis on the fictional aspects of memory, which sees the return to the uses of literary studies;
12. A new phenomenon, in the light of, memory storage facilities outside the body is both an anxiety of cognitive offloading, but also a positive assessment of new extensions of the mind. 
 
What we also have seen is that the traditional divide between the arts and humanities, and the sciences is narrowing. There is a renewed appetite within the academe, and beyond, for interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration. The Memory Network has played a role in this process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We already have assembled a team which is keen to investigate in more detail the effects of the digital world on our cognition, memory and behaviour.
