In fact, human users tend to anthropomorphise computers and virtual agents, treating them as social beings, and interpreting their behaviour similarly to daily human-human interactions.

The problem of assessing people's personality is very important for multiple research and business domains such as computer-mediated staff assessment and training, human-computer and human-robot interaction. Despite a growing interest and emphasis on personality traits and their effects on human life in general, and recent advances in machine analysis of human behavioural signals (e.g., vocal expressions, and physiological reactions), pioneering efforts focusing on machine analysis of personality traits have started to emerge only recently: (i) there exist a small number of efforts based on unimodal cues such as written texts/ audio/ speech/ static facial features, (ii) despite tentative efforts on multimodal personality trait analysis, the dynamics (duration, speed, etc.) of multiple cues, which have been shown to be important in human judgments of personalities, have mostly been neglected, (iii) although personality analysis research suggests that a trait exists in all people to a greater or lesser degree (i.e. a person can be anywhere on a continuum ranging from introversion to extraversion), none of the proposed efforts have attempted to assess personality traits continuously in time and space (i.e., how a person can be rated along the multiple trait dimensions at a given interaction time and context), and (iv) how machine (automatic) traits analysis can be utilised for personalised, social and adaptive human - virtual agent interaction has not been investigated.

Overall, both the common everyday technology (e.g., personal PCs, smart phones) and the more sophisticated systems people use nowadays (e.g., computer games, assistive technologies, embodied virtual agents, etc.) lack the capability of understanding their human users' personality and behaviour, and of providing socially intelligent, adaptive and engaging human - computer interaction.

To address these issues and limitations, MAPTRAITS project will bring around a set of audio-visual tools that can analyse and predict human personality traits dynamically from multiple nonverbal cues and channels (i.e., upper body, head, face, voice and their dynamics) in continuous time and trait space. There is no prospect of building a perfect system for automatic analysis of personality traits that can be used in all possible application domains in 12 months' time. Therefore, as a proof-of-concept, the MAPTRAITS technology will be developed for automatic matching of virtual agent and user personalities, to automatically model what type of users would like to engage with what type of virtual agents to the aim of user engagement enhancement. The motivation for choosing this application area lies in its significance: (i) Research has shown that people's attitudes toward machines and conversational agents is based on the perceived personality of the agent, and their own personality, and (ii) humans are social beings, and currently their everyday life revolves around interacting with computers, virtual agents and robots that are getting increasingly popular as companions, coaches, user interfaces to smart homes, or household robots.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The MAPTRAITS project will focus on machine analysis of personality traits. It will bring around a set of audio-visual tools to analyse and predict human personality traits dynamically from multiple nonverbal cues and channels in continuous time and trait space (represented with multiple trait dimensions), to match virtual agents with human users. 

The line of research targeted in this funding application is highly interdisciplinary and the research outcomes can be spun into the outer society in various ways. Relevant beneficiaries are identified based on the expected term of impact. 

In the short term, the output of the research proposed will benefit national and international research groups working in the area of social signal processing, human behaviour analysis and interpretation, and embodied and relational agent community and applications. The most immediate application of the proposed research is in the areas of embodied conversational agent and relational agent design by addressing issues related to personalised, adaptive and engaging user - agent interaction, and by providing such agents with the means of analysing and understanding the nonverbal behaviour and personality of their users, to guide the agent's social interaction and personalisation ability. This in turn will improve their effectiveness in various application domains related to learning and health care, namely virtual tutoring, elderly care, cyber coaching and cyber therapy. From an interdisciplinary point of view, the knowledge gained will impact the understanding of the role of the personality traits in human - agent interactions. 

In the medium term, a system capable of assessing human personality traits displayed in naturalistic and spontaneous settings (non-verbal behaviours expressed through facial expressions, body gestures, and vocal cues) has the potential to alter significantly other existing technologies, and become applicable and expandable to multiple domains. Examples of such domains are: (1) recommending interfaces to people (matching people's personality traits with household robots, or virtual agents); (2) personal wellness technologies (prescription of exercise programs taking the patient's personality into account, prescription of therapies for people suffering from personality disorders, and guided therapy); (3) e-learning (to assess a student's personality and engage the student in studying that is most suited to his or her personality); and (4) pre-employment assessment (matching personality traits with job requirements).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98427</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Istanbul Technical University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Turkey, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>ITU student internship</gtr:description><gtr:id>698CB0F1-F6C9-4C0A-AACA-CC2505FDE45B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The student visit enabled development of international research collaborations between QMUL and ITU.

Visum 2016 was the 4th VISion Understanding and Machine intelligence (visum) Summer School that targeted to gather at Universidade do Porto, Portugal, Ph.D. candidates, Post-Doctoral scholars and researchers from academia and industry with research interests in computer vision and machine intelligence. Considering the existing gap between the most fundamental concepts of computer vision and their application in real world scenarios, the realisation of visum school seeked to bridge these two key domains. By creating an expert multicultural environment, visum school aimed to foster junior researchers' awareness of computer vision topics, as well as to enhance all attendees' knowledge regarding the state of the art, provided by leading international experts on the field. Visum comprised three main tracks: fundamental, industrial and application topics, each one with extensive practical `hands-on' sessions. The goal was to enable questioning and cross-fertilization of ideas through being exposed to multidisciplinary topics and tasks, potentially leading to significant breakthroughs in the development of the theses of the student participants.

This live demo received a lot of attention by the Slovenian media, both national radio and TV, as well as other conference participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/prispevki-in-izjave-slovenska-kronika/174334071</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>invited talk on 'Affective and Social Signal Processing for Human-Computer and Human-Robot Interaction' at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1BA1380B-62AB-4325-BF58-811B88E5F028</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Hatice Gunes was invited to give a research seminar on 'Affective and Social Signal Processing for Human-Computer and Human-Robot Interaction' at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) on 22nd of June 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/files/research_seminar_20160622.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>90000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>College PhD studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Queen Mary University of London - Barts and the London School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>86118CF8-D04C-43EA-987D-D73A7748A54D</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>400000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Digital Personhood Sandpit</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>ECSA1N4R/S</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>3BF881F6-F216-453A-B5E7-62870BAF0A77</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>562000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Innovate UK</gtr:department><gtr:description>Enhancing User Experience in Retail</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of the UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>6177D415-8F02-477E-A23E-6E3B1F80DBC0</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The automatic personality analysis system has now been implemented as a real-time analyser.

We extended our research from the MAPTRAITS project to the Being There project, and conducted comparative experiments with the extroverted versus introverted robot condition showing that: (1) perceived enjoyment with the NAO robot is found to be significantly correlated with participants' extroversion trait (which validates the similarity rule); (2) NAO robot's perceived empathy positively correlates with participants' extroversion trait - extroverted people feel more control over their interactions and judge them as more intimate and less incompatible; (3) perceived enjoyment with the robot is highly correlated with the agreeableness trait of the participants; (4) a significant relationship is also established between perceived robot's realism and the neuroticism trait of the participants - people who score high on neuroticism tend to perceive their interactions as being forced and strained, therefore artificial behaviours of the robot might appear to them as realistic (Celiktutan and Gunes, IEEE RO-MAN 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the MAPTRAITS project are now being incorporated into the design of the EPSRC 'Being There: Humans and Robots in Public Space' project (EP/L00416X/1) for telepresence and human-robot interactions.
