As you walk, your eyeballs constantly move around to compensate for the movements of your head. The structures responsible for monitoring head movement and feeding this information to the muscles of the eyeball are the semicircular canals of the inner ear. There are three of these half-moon shaped canals, one for each rotation of the head (e.g. tip up-down, rotate left-right and tilt left-right). These supply information via the brain to three pairs of muscles that can move the eyeball in the opposite direction to that of the head (e.g. tip down-up, rotate right-left and tilt right-left). Both the canals and muscles pairs are critical to the lives of all vertebrates. Without rapid communication between the canals and the muscle pairs, the compensatory movements of the eyes would lag behind movements of the head during motion, the image on the eye's retina would blur, and you would soon feel dizzy and eventually fall over. These are the severely debilitating symptoms experienced by patients with conditions like Meniere's disease. Clearly the eye muscles must move quickly to counteract movements of the head sensed by the canals. You might therefore imagine that the plane through each pair of muscles is aligned with the plane of the semicircular canal providing the primary input (e.g. up-down canal lies parallel to the muscle pair that moves the eye down-up). That way the signal output would closely match the direction of action required (e.g. a computer cursor is most easily moved up and down by moving the mouse up and down rather than side to side or diagonally). Such close spatial matching of signal and action would minimize the need for time-consuming readjustments of the signal by the brain. Because an aligned arrangement would seem to be the simplest and most logical, people have assumed that the planes are indeed parallel, or near to parallel. Over decades this assumption has gradually gained in credence, even appearing in some textbooks and as the basis for mathematical models of inner ear and eye muscle function. However, it turns out that there is evidence, albeit very limited, to suggest that the planes are not parallel and that the brain must therefore do some processing of the signal arising from the canals. The problem is that because the eye muscles and canals are not generally accessible to physical inspection, the available data is too little to ascertain the extent of the difference between the planes and whether such differences are the same in all animals, particularly those used in research. This means several important questions remain unanswered: First and foremost, are the mathematical models used in research to understand, for example, motion sickness employing the appropriate numbers? Second, is the difference in orientation connected to whether you normally move around rapidly or slowly, or on two or four legs? Or, is it primarily due to differences in the position of the eyes within the skull: for example is the arrangement the same in cats where the eyes face forward as it is in rabbits where the eyes face sideways. To answer these and other questions I propose imaging the heads of 100 dead mammals and measuring the difference in the plane of each pair of eye muscles and the corresponding semicircular canal. Twenty to forty rhesus monkeys and rabbits will be examined to determine variations within species. The remaining 40-60 specimens will be sampled to represent a wide range of sizes, types of body movement and skull shapes. I propose imaging the mammals with a magnetic resonance imager (MRI). This will enable me to look into the head without physically damaging it. Associations of the divergence of the planes with body size, mode of body movement and skull architecture will be evaluated with a set of complex mathematical tools called geometric morphometrics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) determines how all mammals interact with their environment during locomotion. Consequently, a greater knowledge of VOR is paramount in understanding how and why mammals evolved such varied locomotive strategies like flying, swimming and walking and how the architecture of the skull might have constrained or expedited such adjustments. These insights could initiate profound shifts in our understanding of mammalian evolution, of the influence of non-genetic factors on morphology and of the efficacy of mammal species in models of inner ear disease. The VOR system of compensatory ocular movements in response to stimulation of the kinetic labyrinth is highly complex and has been the focus of considerable research and contention for decades. Perhaps the simplest and seemingly least controversial influence on the VOR is the spatial orientation of the planes of the semicircular canals relative to the planes of the paired extraocular muscles. However, despite its obvious importance, we know very little of this spatial arrangement except for in humans and a few laboratory species. This paucity of data persists because neither the extraocular muscles nor the kinetic labyrinth (semicircular canals) are generally accessible to inspection within the same spatial reference frame. Dissection is not a viable method given the scarcity of material and non-invasive x-ray imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) only properly visualise the hard tissues. Thus, our understanding of the anatomy that underpins the VOR, its significance in the evolutionary emergence of different locomotive strategies as well as the aetiology of VOR failure and the validity of non-human disease models is severely lacking. The proposed project aims to document in detail the anatomy of the vestibular and ocular axes across mammals and resolve the possible influences of locomotion and skull morphology by testing the following hypotheses: H1. The planes of the canals and corresponding muscle pairs are in parallel across a range of mammals. I expect this hypothesis to be falsified given the limited data already available (Simpson &amp;amp; Graf, 1981; Ezure &amp;amp; Graf, 1984). If H1 is falsified then: H2. The degree of divergence from parallel alignment is the same for three canals and across all mammals. The focus here is to ascertain whether the problem of spatial mismatch is the same for the three axes of motion and between species. If H2 is falsified then: H3. The interspecific variation in non-alignment can be explained by the surrounding cranial morphology, the orientation of the petrous pyramids, and of the orbits in particular. The aim is to uncover whether variations are primarily constrained by the architecture of skull, in which case divergence should vary significantly between frontal and lateral eyed species sharing the same locomotive strategy or is driven by function, in which case the degree of divergence should be similar in species with similar locomotive strategies irrespective of surrounding skull morphology. The influence of the phylogenetic relationships between the species studied will also be evaluated. The project aims to address these questions by taking three-dimensional measurements of the canals and muscle pairs from magnetic resonance (MR) images of post mortem mammals ranging from small arboreal species such as the squirrel to the larger bovids. Past studies (see refs in case for support) and pilot work (unpublished; Figs. 1a-c) have shown that the necessary measurements of soft and hard tissues can be obtained from MRI scans. I propose to sample 100 specimens from various museum collections. Specimens will be MR imaged and spatial xyz data will be collected from the images and built into 3D models of the arrangement of the ocular muscles and semicircular canals. Proposed associations will be evaluated with bivariate methods and a suite of shape analysis methods called geometric morphometrics.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>230417</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/451647DB-28DA-4737-8C01-220BBA96E88A"><gtr:id>451647DB-28DA-4737-8C01-220BBA96E88A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The primate subarcuate fossa and its relationship to the semicircular canals part II: adult interspecific variation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of human evolution</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0d633df1ad6ee6be3e3efdbf244d61df"><gtr:id>0d633df1ad6ee6be3e3efdbf244d61df</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jeffery N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0047-2484</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D000068/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
