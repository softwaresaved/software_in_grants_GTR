Educational technologies, public-private partnerships and shifting employer expectations are resulting in rapid and unprecedented 'unbundling' and marketization of Higher Education. For example, over the past few years we have witnessed the appearance of many flexible online courses and qualifications, short courses and MOOCs, often delivered in partnerships between universities and private organisations. Unbundling refers to the process of disaggregating curricula into standalone units often available in flexible online modes, allowing universities to respond to the pressures of widening access, increasing student numbers, competition from alternative providers and technological change, by distributing provision across several individual, more cost-effective components. 
Marketization refers to the increasing presence of alternative (private) providers offering HE provision alongside universities, often through online means and at lower costs, and the emerging partnerships between universities and private providers to offer accredited learning at a wide range of levels. 

In particular, the South African higher education context seems poised to benefit from market-based innovations that may assist with the need to increase equality and access across the diverse sectors of South African society. Whilst these changes may offer opportunities for increased numbers of learners to access education and thus contribute to economic prosperity, there is very little empirical research about the process and impact of unbundling, or the marketization of Higher Education in Africa, or developed countries. In practice, we are observing the emergence of unspecified business models based on different flavours of 'unbundling', which in turn are leading to unclear relationships between universities and private partners or providers. 

For unbundled technology enhanced education or public-private partnerships to impact positively on sustainable economic growth in Africa, there is an urgent need for systematic research in this area, which is the topic of this timely and innovative proposal. Therefore, we ask the following overarching question: How are unbundling and marketization changing the nature of higher education provision in South Africa, and what impact will this have on widening access, educational achievement, employability and thus the potential for economic development? We will explore this research question through a focus on the process of 'educational market making'. We aim to examine marketization and unbundling in HE as the outcomes of negotiations and manoeuvres which have a 'constitutive' function. Our central assumption is that markets do not appear naturally, but are 'made' through increasingly networked interactions that involve individual decision-making, collective discourse, technical expertise and the deployment of key 'objects': educational technologies, data analysis techniques, and innovative business models. Our study will rely on primary evidence collected through interviews with 'experts', and on the analysis of available datasets, documents and other artefacts and, crucially, through systematic engagement with a wide range of stakeholders. 
 
The outcomes of this project will directly impact the future development of HE in South Africa, other African countries and in the UK, through providing evidence of the effectiveness of disaggregation of curricula and alternative providers offering HE on educational outcomes, access to HE and employability. The project will have direct impact through critically evaluating the on-going trends of 'unbundling' and marketization on South Africa's economic development. The research will provide evidence of the effectiveness of educational technology to support the emerging HE market, directly impacting the educational technology sector, technology suppliers and alternative HE providers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The planned outcomes of this project have been designed to directly impact on the future development of HE in South Africa, other African countries and in the UK, through providing evidence of the effectiveness of disaggregation of curricula and alternative providers offering HE on educational outcomes, access to HE and employability. The project aims to have direct impact through critically evaluating the on-going trends of 'unbundling' and marketization on South Africa's economic development. The research will provide evidence of the effectiveness of educational technology to support the emerging HE market, directly impacting the educational technology sector, technology suppliers and alternative HE providers. During the project, short-term impact will be achieved through engagement and discussion with HE decision makers, alternative providers and employers at workshops and interviews. These sessions have been designed to have multiple benefits: (1) collection of research data for the project and (2) opportunities for participants to consider and vocalise the emerging trends from their experience, and network with peers. A robust knowledge base will contribute to the long-term dimension of our impact strategy in supporting South African stakeholders to engage productively in policy debates which are likely to have profound transformational implications for the HE sector, with consequential impacts for the economic and social welfare of South Africa. Our approach will produce knowledge and guidance to help South African stakeholders define criteria for decision-making and self-governance in relation to the emerging economic, educational and technological landscape. 

The chief potential beneficiaries of our impact approach in South Africa are: (i) HE institutional leaders; (ii) policy makers in the HE sector; (iii) academics and students; (iv) employers; (v) alternative HE providers. We have identified a range of organisations and groups - governmental organisations, think tanks, professional membership associations - with whom we will engage directly during and beyond the project:
- The Council for Higher Education, which provides advice to the South African Minister of Higher Education and Training on all aspects of higher education policy.
- Universities South Africa: the main membership body representing South Africa's universities, whose Board comprises 26 Vice-Chancellors.
- The Higher Education Learning &amp;amp; Teaching Association of Southern Africa (HELTASA): a membership organisation focused on academic development.
- The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), whose mandate is to inform effective formulation and monitoring of government policy.
- Alternative HE providers, including Pearson Education, FutureLearn and Coursera, who offer large scale credit bearing HE provision in South Africa and globally.

With regard to policy makers and leaders in South African HEIs, the study will lead to guidance frameworks for informed decision-making, for example when approaching the following activities: (i) procurement and institutional deployment of educational technologies; (ii) development of public-private partnerships; (iii) design and delivery of educational curricula and co-curricular activities. In addition to decision makers and leaders, the study will be of value to employers, educators, students and communities of interest within the general public, as it will provide insights about the 'direction of travel' of HE, and opportunities to engage in the debate about the redefinition of areas of public value in higher education. The recent protests in South Africa, concerns about the rising costs of higher education, and the interest in MOOCs in the mainstream media suggest increasing interest in the trajectory of HE provision. Whilst the project is largely focussed on the South African HE system, beneficiaries in other countries, including wider Africa and the UK will also be potentially impacted.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>395222</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P002102/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F9D6F76D-4C6C-4E36-8E06-D471DED87098</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5678A899-0926-491B-8E52-E55211E3F83B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>ICT and education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
