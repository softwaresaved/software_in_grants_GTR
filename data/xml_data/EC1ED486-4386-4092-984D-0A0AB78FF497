Moreover, for the last two hundred years the United States has been protected by vast oceans and buffeted by relatively weak neighbours. American foreign policy, then, has not actually been driven as much by necessity (such as a fear of invasion) as by choice. In such circumstances, ideology and values -- such as those embodied in religious thought -- have played a large role in debates over how America chooses to wield its massive power. Consequently, the ways in which Americans perceive their role in the world -- and how best to wield their military, political, diplomatic, and economic power -- have been shaped indelibly by their religious beliefs and values.\n\nHowever, historians have left the relationship between religion and foreign policy relatively unexplored. It is this gap in the historical literature -- which, consequently, has created a gap in our general understanding -- which my book will fill. I have already addressed these historiographical, methodological, and theoretical issues in a peer-reviewed article, 'Bridging the Gap between Church and State in the History of American Foreign Relations,' published by the journal Diplomatic History (vol 30, no 5, November 2006, pp 783-812). This article arose from my readings in the fields of American religious history and American diplomatic history, and resulted from my attempt to bridge these two enormous bodies of literature.\n\nIn broad terms, my book will illuminate the role religion has played in shaping how Americans approach issues of war and diplomacy; trace the origins and rise of religion's influence; place the current, rather novel dominance of the interventionist strain of evangelical Protestantism within its proper historical context; and, finally, demonstrate religion's impact upon the ways in which Americans have debated issues of foreign affairs and military intervention. When finished, my book will not simply be a straightforward narrative of the religious influence on war and diplomacy, but an analytical investigation into how this relationship evolved and what its impact has been. I have decided to tackle the entire spectrum of American history because this is a topic that is best explored over the broad sweep of time. The tensions between change and continuity that act as the book's narrative engine and analytical foundation cannot be perceived without such a wide focus.\n\nHow, for example, did militant colonial Puritanism lead to Congregational and Unitarian pacifism three centuries later? How did fundamentalist Baptists, who had always been the strictest observers of the separation of church and state, come to embrace an activist, interventionist American role abroad? How did Catholics and Jews use foreign relations to emerge from the periphery of American society to the centre, and how did these transformations influence the direction of US foreign policy? Most importantly for my purposes, how did these and other developments shape American engagement with the wider world?\n\nThroughout history, Americans -- be they liberal or conservative, pacifist or militarist -- have sought to reform the world in America's image. The core hypothesis informing my research is that such a development would have been impossible without the influence of American religion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17659</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/84C6F117-5F85-479D-9ABF-FD1F05094439"><gtr:id>84C6F117-5F85-479D-9ABF-FD1F05094439</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sword of the Spirit, Shield of Faith: Religion in American War and Diplomacy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9846858337ce3f6683945d133a1de2f9"><gtr:id>9846858337ce3f6683945d133a1de2f9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Preston</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781400043231</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/98BB53A0-872A-49E8-B092-535EC3D53C2A"><gtr:id>98BB53A0-872A-49E8-B092-535EC3D53C2A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Politics of Realism and Religion: Christian Responses to Bush's New World Order*</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Diplomatic History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1a3aaab704eb8a0aec80fc7b4cb103f0"><gtr:id>1a3aaab704eb8a0aec80fc7b4cb103f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>preston a</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F015119/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
