This is due in part to the perception that Latin America has not been a hub of scientific production and thus has lacked a receptive aesthetic culture that reacts to news of such innovations, particularly in the frenzied period of scientific and technological breakthroughs during the nineteenth century and beyond. The 'Science in Text and Culture in Latin America' network will seek to rectify this assumption by bringing together a group of scholars to study the diverse ways in which Latin American writers and artists have responded to scientific and technological innovations occurring both locally and globally, from the nineteenth century to the present day. We will respond to research, recently published and in progress, that is starting to reveal a wealth of histories, methodologies and interpretations of the dialogues that existed between these two apparently distinct realms. To enhance this conversation, the network includes contemporary writers, film directors and dramatists from Latin America whose work is informed by advances in science and technology, and who employ science to imagine alternative histories or views of their region. 
We have planned a number of activities over the course of two years to maximize the potential of the network. Firstly, we will organize four international symposia in Oxford, Buenos Aires, San Juan (Puerto Rico) and Cambridge, each of which will be structured around different historical, cultural and aesthetic questions concerning the relationship between science and the arts. All four encounters will feature conversations between researchers and creative practitioners whose works cross the boundaries between these two realms. We are especially keen to offer travel bursaries to postgraduate and postdoctoral students, to allow them to participate actively in these international encounters. In the first symposium, hosted by the University of Oxford, we will focus on what happens when we cross the boundaries between science and art, both in creative practice and in research, and raise awareness of the value of interdisciplinary approaches. The second symposium, to be held in San Juan, will focus specifically on the phenomenon of science fiction in the region. The third symposium, to be held in Buenos Aires, will explore the historical conversations between science and literature in Latin America, and how these in turn yield theories of what it means to be modern. In the last symposium, at the University of Cambridge, we will ask what light recent theories of creativity and evolution can throw on our understanding of innovation both in science and in creative writing (or other forms of narrative art). Aside from bringing renowned artists from Latin America to the UK, such as the Argentine dramatist Rafael Spregelburd, the two UK-based symposia will develop comparative perspectives by featuring talks by scholars working on European and Anglo-American literature and science. 
Beyond the international symposia, a number of other activities will also take place within the network period to extend the impact of the project to the general public. These include screenings of Latin American science fiction films in Cambridge and London, and an exhibition of Mexican, Argentine and Brazilian texts and artifacts from the nineteenth century to the present in Oxford's History of Science Museum, as well as a network website, which will be regularly updated. Two edited books and a number of articles will come out of the network, marking its intervention in Latin American and interdisciplinary studies. The network harbours a number of exciting possibilities beyond its two-year period of operation, and will pave the way for applications for a major research grant on this theme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principal non-academic beneficiaries of this research network will be a) the local communities in Cambridge, Oxford and London (UK), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and San Juan (Puerto Rico) who will attend events designed with the general public in mind, and b) journalists, writers, and other members of the wider public in the UK, Europe, US and Latin America with an interest in science fiction, the history of science and/or Latin America.

The social, cultural and economic benefits of this research network will include the following: 

1. Raising awareness among the general public in the UK and abroad of the particular ways in which themes of universal interest (science, modernity and technology) have been inscribed in Latin American literature and culture, thereby expanding knowledge and providing a broader understanding of the importance of these themes in culture and society.

2. Reinforcing the value of the national and regional literary, artistic and cultural heritage for the general public in Argentina and Puerto Rico. 

3. Generating audiences and revenue for the Arts Picturehouse in Cambridge, with whom we intend to work on scheduling screenings of important Latin American science fiction films.

4. Raising awareness of the work of, and generating visitors for, the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, where we intend to hold the exhibition and one or two keynote sessions. 

5. Raising the profile of Latin American studies within the UK, and of UK academic research within a global context, by making Oxford and Cambridge the coordinating hubs for a number of events related to the network, and bringing international participants to the UK for two international symposia. We also hope to attract future overseas applicants for Master's and PhD programmes at UK universities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36115</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We are developing a virtual exhibition of images to accompany the events organized as part of the research network on Science in Text and Culture in Latin America.

Latin America has all too often been cast as lagging behind Europe and North America in scientific development: a place where new scientific ideas are received or tested rather than generated. While previous scholarship has often focused on the limits of science in Latin America or its co-option for authoritarian and disciplinary purposes, many of our contributors sought to provide an important corrective, revealing a region that has pioneered many scientific advances in its history, and bringing to light ways in which science has fueled a series of visionary utopian projects in politics, art and culture. Some areas of particular interest emerged, including the development of new scientific theories and therapies in Latin America; emancipatory political projects founded on scientific paradigms; a new understanding of the relationship between indigenous knowledge and Western science; the genesis of disciplines and institutions in the Latin American context; and the creative innovations that have resulted from the literary and artistic experimentation with scientific ideas. 

The network was extremely successful in bringing together scholars and postgraduate students from across many regions of the world, with the aim of establishing a firmer foundation for a rapidly growing new area of research. Many productive dialogues were held across disciplinary boundaries, eg history and philosophy of science, art, literature, colonial history, media studies, and well as between scholars working in the colonial and contemporary periods. We were also able to use the final event, held in Cambridge, to explore comparative dimensions of our project, by focusing on how the field of science and culture studies has evolved differently in Latin America when compared with similar fields in Anglophone and Francophone studies. We have identified a strong group of researchers (both early career and more established scholars) with whom future collaboration would be extremely productive, and we intend to build on the success of the research network by applying for a major grant in the near future.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We published our initial findings in the form of symposium reports (available via this link: http://www.latin-american.cam.ac.uk/science-text-culture). Symposia were &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; on Twitter, so people in other locations could follow the proceedings. We also have a good following on Facebook and Twitter and through this our members are now connected to a number of interesting research groups on connected themes.

We have also secured an advance contract with the University Press of Florida for a book provisionally entitled &amp;quot;Latin America at the Vanguard: Science and its Imaginaries&amp;quot;. This will represent a significant contribution to knowledge which is designed to appeal to non-academic as well as academic audiences. It will bring together the work of renowned and emerging scholars from Latin America, Europe, the UK, and the US who are leading voices in the field of science and culture studies in Latin America, working in the fields of history of science, art history, anthropology, literary and cultural studies. Short introductions to each themed cluster of chapters will outline the historical, cultural and theoretical contexts of individual interventions, and the chapters themselves will offer an alternative and compelling reading of Latin America as the site of a scientific and technical vanguard, both real and imagined, from the colonial period to the present.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2F06D766-7E57-4CCD-99D6-F7EB7E9E48E8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.latin-american.cam.ac.uk/science-text-culture</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L013029/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA5B898B-8204-4E59-97AB-DA2B10124EED</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; Theatre - Other</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04B7A494-75A7-4241-9AA9-A7791BD4328A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic &amp; Latin American Stud</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9EFA3E9E-2186-4589-A542-814A214E3D57</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic, Portguese &amp; Latin</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
