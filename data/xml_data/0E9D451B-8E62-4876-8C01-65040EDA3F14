Objects encoding symmetry are known as groups, and groups act on geometric configurations which are called spaces. A particularly nice class of spaces with a lot of symmetry are the so called symmetric spaces which were discovered at the beginning of the twentieth century by E. Cartan. 

If one combines representation theory with the concept of deformation quantisation, which describes the transition from classical to quantum mechanics, then one obtains quantum groups which have been intensely studied since the mid-eighties. Quantised versions of symmetric spaces exist in this theory as coideal subalgebras.

A quiver is a combinatorial gadget which plays a fundamental role in the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras. The first part of this project is devoted to the surprising observation that coideal subalgebras naturally appear in the representation theory of quivers. The representation category of quivers is particularly nice. If one finds a torsion class in this category, then this produces a coideal subalgebra for the corresponding quantum group. The project aims to investigate this correspondence, and to apply it to ongoing efforts to classify coideal subalgebras. Ideally, this will lead to a new insights about both, coideal subalgebras and representations of quivers. 

The second part of the project is devoted to coideal subalgebras for symmetric spaces. In physics one needs infinite dimensional versions of coideal subalgebras, but luckily good candidates have been constructed recently. The project investigates the role played by these coideal subalgebras in physical models. One aim is to find out if they lead to solutions of the so called reflection equation which describes scattering of particles in a one-dimensional half-infinite system. Another question concerns radial part calculations in the infinite-dimensional case which should provide solutions of classes of physical equations which generalize the Calogero-Moser system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is part of pure mathematics. Many areas of pure mathematics have eventually led to surprising new technological developments, for example in cryptography (elliptic curves), image processing (Fourier transform), radiology (Radon transform), or crystallography (group theory), which constitute a manifest economic and societal benefit. However, I do not expect the suggested research to have any impact of this kind. 

The project will have significant academic impact. The suggested project is expected to lead to important mathematical results which will be of great interest to an international research community. The project aims to develop a new perspective on coideal subalgebras and to explore new relations to the representation theory of quivers. This new perspective will help with the existing classification problem for coideal subalgebras and generate pathways for future research. The study of coideal subalgebras in integrable systems is so far mostly example oriented. The questions about the reflection equation for quantum symmetric Kac-Moody pairs will unify the perspective. Similarly, the suggested radial part calculations will address long-standing questions by Cherednik and others. 

While the subject area of the project is firmly rooted in representation theory, a vibrant discipline of modern mathematics, the project also provides ample links to other areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. I expect significant benefit to come from interaction with researchers in neighbouring disciplines, such as integrable systems. 

Presently, the algebra group at Newcastle University consists of seven staff members and four PhD students but there are no postdoctoral researchers. Academic life thrives if a group or a department comprises all career stages. The research assistant will fill a significant gap in our pure mathematics group. He/she will interact equally with postgraduate students and with staff members. He/she will contribute youthful enthusiasm and energise the department. The research assistant will be a valuable addition to the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Newcastle University.

Indeed, the main societal and economic impact of the suggested research project outside academia lies in the person of the research assistant. The research assistant will most likely be strengthening the British economy after completion of the project, either as a lecturer in higher education or by joining industry. Probably he/she will move to the North-East of England and strengthen the region.

The present funding situation for young researchers in mathematics and theoretical physics in Britain is not easy. There is a serious shortage of positions which allow the transition from a PhD degree programme to a scientific career. This is so despite the fact, that industry and finance welcome young mathematical researchers into their ranks after a postdoctoral period. 

The present project provides one such position which allows an early career researcher to engage deeply with a scientific subject. He/she will interact with an international community and grow as a scientist. This will make him/her a more inspiring lecturer at a later career stage, and it will also turn him/her into a more resourceful professional, should he/she subsequently take on a position in industry. The research project will be a valuable experience for the researcher and will prepare him/her to contribute in many societal and economic contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101115</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As outlined in the impact statement for this project, the research within this project formed part of pure mathematics.

Beyond the intrinsic value of mathematics, the proposed research did not have any impact of the above kind.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>46F034CE-FCD6-484B-89AD-FDABD4838CC1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Quantum groups provide a uniform setting for solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. This equation provides a condition which guarantees that certain models in (quantum) statistical mechanics (spin chains, lattice models) or in scattering theory can be solved. Simplified, the condition implies that the system is independent of the ordering in which three (or many) particles interact with each other. In the theory of quantum groups, solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equations are realised via a universal R-matrix, which is an element in the ambient symmetry algebra. 

For systems with boundary, additionally, the (quantum) reflection equation enters the picture. Systems based on solutions of the reflection equation are additionally independent of the ordering in which particles are reflected at the boundary. The symmetry at the boundary is described by a second symmetry algebra, and good candidates for this symmetry algebra are provided in the theory of quantum symmetric pairs. It was long believed, that solutions of the reflection equation can be uniformly realised via a so-called universal K-matrix, but only in the simplest examples had it so far been possible to construct such a universal K-matrix directly. 

The main outcome of this project consists of the uniform construction of a universal K-matrix for all quantum symmetric pairs. The essential impulse for this construction came from two pioneering preprints which appeared in autumn 2013 and which placed quantum symmetric pairs in a much wider representation theoretic context. Ehrig/Stroppel at Bonn University followed a program of categorification which suggested in particular that quantum symmetric pairs have a bar-involution, that is, a symmetry which already proved crucial in the development of quantum groups. Bao/Wang at the University of Virginia suggested that large parts of the theory of quantum groups, as developed in G. Lusztig's landmark monograph, can be extended to the setting of quantum symmetric pairs, and that this will lead to deep applications. This work provided essential new ideas necessary for the construction of a universal K-matrix.

On a more technical level, the key findings of this project are summarised as follows: We established the existence of a bar involution for quantum symmetric pairs in general. This also led to a deeper understanding of the algebraic structure of quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebras. We obtained an improved presentation of these algebras in terms of generators and relations, involving Lusztig's skew derivations to describe lower order terms. All this is contained in the paper 'The bar involution for quantum symmetric pairs'.

Using the bar involution, and following the program suggested by Bao/Wang, it was then possible to prove the existence of a universal K-matrix for quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebras. The construction proceeds in astonishing similarity to the construction of the universal R-matrix for quantum groups in Lusztig's monograph. Most arguments are performed in the most general Kac-Moody case. These results are contained in the paper 'Universal K-matrix for quantum symmetric pairs'.

As part of the project a Miniworkshop on 'Coideal subalgebras of quantum groups' was organised at the Oberwolfach Research Institute for Mathematics (MFO). This workshop brought together experts on coideal subalgebras from different backgrounds (integrable systems, special functions, quantum symmetric pairs, representation theory, Nichols algebras). The aim was to get to know each others perspective, to analyse the present state of the art, and to pursue avenues of mathematical cross-fertilisation. The extended abstracts of the workshop have been published as an 'Oberwolfach Report'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research outcomes form part of pure mathematics with connections to mathematical physics and have mostly academic impact. The investigation of quantum symmetric pairs has gained significant momentum over the past few years. It is now clear that the theory of quantum symmetric pairs is as rich as the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum enveloping algebras. Many aspects, however, still need to be developed, and this is presently subject to intense research within the representation theory community. 

As outlined in the impact summary, the main societal and economic impact of the project outside academia lies in the person of the research assistant. Martina Balagovic spent two years on the project, and has meanwhile been hired as a lecturer in mathematics at Newcastle University.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>48DEB3BA-833B-42AC-BF12-F247DF65EC67</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AD15A6A9-89F0-4707-98D6-2648C7B7DCEC"><gtr:id>AD15A6A9-89F0-4707-98D6-2648C7B7DCEC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Universal K-matrix for quantum symmetric pairs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal f?r die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Crelles Journal)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c13e3ce58884e6d59fae16ab3a443903"><gtr:id>c13e3ce58884e6d59fae16ab3a443903</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Balagovic M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AC71CC8E-0438-44A0-BEC0-F8C66EEF1133"><gtr:id>AC71CC8E-0438-44A0-BEC0-F8C66EEF1133</gtr:id><gtr:title>The bar involution for quantum symmetric pairs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Representation Theory of the American Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c13e3ce58884e6d59fae16ab3a443903"><gtr:id>c13e3ce58884e6d59fae16ab3a443903</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Balagovic M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9D7B9174-DC96-4923-906A-54DE6C90CEAF"><gtr:id>9D7B9174-DC96-4923-906A-54DE6C90CEAF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Radial Part Calculations for $\widehat {\mathfrak {sl}}_2$ and the Heun-KZB Heat Equation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Mathematics Research Notices</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/53aec6e2948f94cea420d9d5d2edef1c"><gtr:id>53aec6e2948f94cea420d9d5d2edef1c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kolb S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A1120D0C-B996-4EE0-90FE-FEEB42C61E7A"><gtr:id>A1120D0C-B996-4EE0-90FE-FEEB42C61E7A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantum symmetric Kac-Moody pairs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/53aec6e2948f94cea420d9d5d2edef1c"><gtr:id>53aec6e2948f94cea420d9d5d2edef1c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kolb S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/570D1285-5DB5-4A8D-A852-FE36BD189502"><gtr:id>570D1285-5DB5-4A8D-A852-FE36BD189502</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mini-Workshop: Coideal Subalgebras of Quantum Groups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oberwolfach Reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/17a7ab2daeb22fe05990be2107f1d22c"><gtr:id>17a7ab2daeb22fe05990be2107f1d22c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Heckenberger I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/97E73CA6-7F5A-432A-B534-AFDA3247FC13"><gtr:id>97E73CA6-7F5A-432A-B534-AFDA3247FC13</gtr:id><gtr:title>Irreducible modules for the degenerate double affine Hecke algebra of type A as submodules of Verma modules</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c13e3ce58884e6d59fae16ab3a443903"><gtr:id>c13e3ce58884e6d59fae16ab3a443903</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Balagovic M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K025384/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
