Our increasing need to connect to anything (from people to services and physical things) at any time and to access/exchange increasing amounts of information despite the existing limitations in the available frequency spectrum and processing capabilities, as well as our need to experience &amp;quot;zero-latency&amp;quot; wireless access, has imposed the need to revisit the way communication systems are designed.
 
Targeting pragmatic future wireless systems able to deliver the capacity scaling predicted in theory, the proposed research focuses on two, currently in progress, paradigm shifts that have a strong potential to transform the way we design wireless communications systems: (a) The one from orthogonal to non-orthogonal signal transmissions according to which instead of trying to prevent transmitting signals from interfering, we now intentionally allow mutually interfering information streams, and (b) the one from sequential to parallel (receiver) processing according to which instead of using one processing element to perform the calculations of a functionality, we now split the corresponding processing load onto several processing units. While digital processing systems with tens or even hundreds of processing elements have been predicted, it is still not obvious how we can efficiently exploit this processing power to develop high-throughput and power efficient wireless communication systems, and specifically how we can cope with the exponentially computationally intensive case of optimally recovering a large number of (intentionally) interfering information streams.

This research targets a theoretical and practical framework for efficiently parallelizing sphere decoders used to optimally reconstruct a large number of mutually interfering information streams. Sphere decoding is a well-known technique that dramatically reduces the related complexity. However, while sphere decoding is simpler, compared to other solutions that are able to deliver optimal performance, its complexity still increases exponentially with the number of interfering streams, preventing the practical throughput gains from being scaled by increasing the number of mutually interfering streams as predicted in theory. This research targets practical sphere decoders able to support a large number of interfering streams with processing latency or power consumption requirements which are orders of magnitude smaller than those of single processor systems.

The research addresses the key EPSRC priority &amp;quot;Many-Core-Architecture and Concurrency in Distributed and Embedded Systems&amp;quot; and will contribute to the design and implementation of future wireless communication systems by enhancing our understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects related to the development of parallel processing architectures for wireless communication systems and by introducing a framework for related implementation decisions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The evolution of wireless and mobile communication technologies can transform the way we live and work. Investing in the information economy has been recognized by the UK as a way to contribute to a strong sustainable growth and according to the &amp;quot;Information Economy Strategy&amp;quot; (June 2013) &amp;quot;we want the next generation of mobile technology to be developed here in the UK&amp;quot;. This research contributes to this vision and addresses the key EPSRC priority &amp;quot;Many-Core-Architecture and Concurrency in Distributed and Embedded Systems&amp;quot;, by contributing to the theory, design and development of technologies able to scale to the capacity of future wireless communication systems despite the current limitations in frequency spectrum and (single) processors' speed. 

Results of this research will act as enablers of the next generation of wireless communication technologies (e.g., 5G) and will contribute to an enhanced wireless infrastructure which is vitally important for the digital economy and for all the UK business and society. In addition, the research will contribute to UK's academic standing in the field for wireless communications and signal processing, and to the training of highly skilled researchers and engineers who will be exposed to theory and practice of several disciplines (i.e., with elements from communication systems, digital systems design and computer science). 

In addition, since the proposed research addresses the design and implementation of advanced digital systems (e.g., design of Many-Processor on Chip - MPSoC) for wireless and mobile communication systems it can directly impact telecommunications equipment makers (e.g., Huawei, Samsung), semiconductor and system-on-chip manufacturers (e.g., ARM Holdings, NVIDIA) companies who produce embedded hardware and software for wireless communication systems (e.g., Freescale Semiconductor) as well as manufacturers of test equipment (e.g., Aircom, Rhode and Schwarz).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98464</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Virgin Media</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0BB62D59-A001-4E53-9C75-2CAE5A24C240</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Results of the research have been presented to representatives of Virgin Media, as some of the most promising for adoption by future wireless communication systems.

In particular, the research introduced: (a) a mathematical method to a priori identify the &amp;quot;most promising&amp;quot; sphere decoding tree paths to include the transmitted information, (b) the design of a novel sphere decoding partitioning scheme, that is adjustable to the transmission conditions and can focus the processing power on the &amp;quot;most promising&amp;quot; solutions, (c) the design and implementation of a novel complexity-efficient method to allocate symbols to parallel sphere decoders, and (d) the design and implementation of a novel tree traversal and enumeration strategy to avoid unnecessary calculations.
 
The proposed parallelization framework is the first that is (a) scalable and can consistently reduce latency by exploiting any number of the available processing elements, (b) complexity efficient, and, for sphere decoders targeting the optimal solution, it does not increase the overall processing load when increasing the number processing elements, (c) nearly &amp;quot;embarrassingly parallel&amp;quot; as it minimizes dependencies and communication overhead which introduce latency and can moderate if not obliterate the scalability and efficiency of parallelization, (d) adjustable to the transmission conditions and finally (e) applicable to all kinds of sphere decoders, including breadth-first and depth-first, as well as exact (guaranteeing the ML solutions) and approximate sphere decoders. 

In the paper &amp;quot;FlexCore: Massively Parallel and Flexible Processing for Large MIMO Access Points&amp;quot;, which was one of the four selected papers in the field of wireless networks at the highly selective 14th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI), it has been validated via software-defined radio (WARP) testbed evaluation, that for 12x12 multi-antenna systems, the proposed parallelization framework can achieve near-optimal throughput while using an order of magnitude fewer processing elements than state-of-the-art sphere decoders. In addition, FlexCore's GPU implementation is the first able to support all LTE bandwidths, even for 12&amp;times;12 MIMO systems and its flexible, modular and efficient FPGA implementation translated FlexCore's advantage into higher energy and hardware efficiency. According to Google Metrics, NSDI is one of the top two publications in the field of Computing Systems, and in year 2017 FlexCore was the only work representing the UK.

As a side result, an efficient sphere detector implementation has been also proposed that enables throughput increase over the state-of-the-art in very dense constellations (e.g., 1024 QAM).

Multisphere, also raises new research questions regarding the expansion of the corresponding framework to soft receiver processing, the design of many-core architectures that can flexibly and efficiently schedule the available cores, as well as the extension of the proposed research to a joint detection-decoding framework and to other modules in the transceiver chain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of this research are expected to act as enablers of the next generation of wireless communication technologies, contribute to an enhanced wireless infrastructure which is vitally important for the digital economy and for all the UK business and society.
