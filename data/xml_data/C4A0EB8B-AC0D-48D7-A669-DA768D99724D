While artists are often employed in Early Years settings for short term and product driven projects to bring creativity to the classroom, I intend to explore how my art practice might develop as a result of visually engaging with children's collected objects. I am inspired by Walter Benjamin, who saw potential in the collected objects kept by children because of the way that the object has been removed from the 'original functions of its use' (Buck-Morss, 1993, p.352). I will approach the child as both artist and collector in their own right by closely observing how they collect, interact with, and assemble objects. \n\nThis builds on doctoral work where I looked at how children produce artefacts in the context of an early years classroom. During this research, the medium of a hand-held video camera was extremely rich in drawing attention to children's making in a process where the observed guides the observer. By following the interaction between the child's body with the material and objects that they used, I was able to gain a deeper and critical engagement with the processes of making. Film lends itself to interrupting habitual ways of seeing as it can be re-played, slowed down and freeze-framed as a strategy for intensifying seeing. This method of montage and then re-presenting process offers a way to enter into dialogue with the makers of the work. Rather than seeing the artist as the creative expert, this project seeks to develop a methodology where the artist can develop her practice by drawing from different practices encountered while working alongside young children. \n\nThe project consists of two phases. Firstly, through film I will explore objects that children collect and closely observe ways that these objects are then curated and assembled. I will encourage children to document their own objects and assemblages. This will also enable objects from their homes to be presented and reflected on with others. In the second phase I will present my own practice to the children and engage with collaborative work around treasured objects and collecting, challenging the idea of the museum as a repository of fossilised objects. I am interested in the potency of objects and the way that they are collected. My current practice involves collecting souvenirs, ornaments and other personal items from flea markets and second hand shops. I then arrange these unwanted objects into new groupings in accordance with the connections that I make between them. I plan to explore objects that children treasure and collect and what they mean to them; this will be initiated through a class visit to the Bankfield Museum in Halifax in order to look at their 'Collectors Gallery' and toy collection. A curator will talk to the children about what and why they collect objects for museums. Children will also bring their own treasured objects to show to the curator. Here, my own interests as an artist come to the fore, and these will serve as a basis for collaborative art-making. This trip would form the basis of a joint enquiry with the children into treasured objects and the things that people collect. The museum as a repository of collected objects can then be contrasted with objects that we collect and animate our lives with. Back in the classroom, it is to children's own treasured objects and collections that the dialogue shall again turn. We will collaboratively make our own 'mini museum' of objects. What form this temporary museum takes, where it will be exhibited and for who, will be the subject of discussion. This final exhibition aims to bring out the liveliness of objects and explore the relationship they have with the collector. It will cast the children not only as artists, but also as curators who have something important to say about their collections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The children in the early years setting will benefit directly from the input of an artist who values and makes their creative output visible. This will be ensured through the process of documentation that lies at the core of the proposal and the making of this and children's work public in the form of the final exhibition. Regular meetings with staff to present and reflect on the work as it progresses will ensure that a dialogue is sustained through the life of the project about ways to document children's work. A meeting with parents at an early stage of the project will ensure that they understand the nature of the project and will encourage their involvement by supporting children to take pictures of treasured objects in their homes, or by bringing objects into school to show to others. Parents will also have the opportunity to join the trip to Bankfield Museum known for its textile collection, a place they are unlikely to have visited before and one that they would not have normally associated with a family day out. \n\nThe final exhibition brings the work beyond the audience of the school community, including parents, to the wider local community, including both early years practitioners and artists. By collaborating with a local museum the project also brings curators into contact with early years settings through the mediation of an artist. This could potentially impact on the museum's educational activities with this sector, and encourage greater thought into ways of accessing the museum that value children as cultural creators. \n\nA presentation (that will be based on the visual documentation of the project) will be made to a national network of teachers and art practitioners whose work is specifically focussed on working creatively with young children (Earlyarts). A paper will be presented to The 4th International Art(s) in Early Years Conference that draws an audience of practising artists as well as academics from all over the world. The work will contribute to a debate about the role of the artist in schools and the value of different models of artist residency.\n\nThe work has the potential of providing a foundation for discussion for the local continuing professional development of early years teachers and copies of films/photographs taken throughout the project will be given to the school and the local education authority for this purpose. The documented material also has the potential to be used by MMU to provide continuing professional development to early years practitioners and artists.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24734</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Film that was produced as output from the Residency.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BBA5ECA1-DE13-466B-B46D-1D912828005A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film can be viewed on the &amp;quot;Secret Life of Objects&amp;quot; website.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>The Secret Life of Objects</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://secretlifeofobjectssite.wordpress.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Cabinet of items curated as part of the residency, exhibited at Bankfield Museum, Halifax (this museum had been the site of a visit by children as part of my residency).</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B6F27C7-B470-46EC-B884-3938DC301FB7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The piece was part of an art exhibition at Bankfield Museum, Halifax, and had direct links with this site as I had worked with the museum and brought the children to the museum as part of the residency.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>The Secret Life of Objects: a cabinet of Curiosity</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition Held at Dean Clough Art Gallery, Halifax.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E8A59309-CD76-4DD6-856D-B596C47B31D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition at Local Art Gallery: engaging local audience</gtr:impact><gtr:title>The Secret Life of Objects: a cabinet of Curiosity</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Installation that was co-produced with the Teacher in the Foundation Stage Unit where the Residency was sited.

Artefacts from the residency were also display at the Bankfield Museum, Halifax, and Dean Clough Art Gallery, Halifax. In order to engage with other arts practitioners working in the Early Years I led a workshop with two other local artists at an International Early Arts practitioner networking and dissemination event in 2011 event In Halifax, organised by Early Arts. Here I used the residency as a springboard to discuss the role of the artist in early years settings. As a result of this I was invited to guest-edit an international practice oriented website for artists working in schools. I also gave a paper at a practitioner-researcher focussed conference that was aimed at early years practitioners, managers, and policy makers in Birmingham (CREC, 2011).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4C9C3D6D-6B30-47D1-8CE7-8AC055B16D55</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The documentation of the ongoing observations and reflections on practice throughout the residency has provided a rich basis for a discussion about the role of the artist in schools. These reflections all contributed to discussions in the academic context of three international conferences. These forums spanned the disciplines of Arts Based Education, Early Years Practice, as well as Art Education. The research has contributed towards exploring what McArdle (2009: 365) calls the &amp;quot;messy possibilities&amp;quot; of art in school by virtue of its somewhat marginal position. It suggests that the tensions brought into focus are precisely a productive place from which the artist and the early years practitioner can reflect.

Questions around the role of art-practice and the potential of documenting art process as enquiry in classrooms are timely as the use of &amp;quot;Learning Stories&amp;quot; becomes widespread in Early Years settings. The artist's sketchbook was not originally envisaged as the focus of the project and as such the project did not integrate the sketchbook in terms of joint-reflection, although the blog and the archive of photographs were a major site of engagement between the artist, the children and the parents. During the writing up of the project and dissemination, it has become clearer that the artefacts of documentation were themselves a potential site of engagement and reflection between artist and teacher and child. I have theorised this using Springgay and Irwin's idea of A/R/tography (2008) in a paper presented at the British Early Childhood Research Association conference, The Art of Practice-based Inquiry: Early Childhood Professionals &amp;amp; Research. This idea was further developed in a book chapter in Children, Pedagogy and the Arts (2013) edited by Felicity McArdle and Gail Boldt (part of an arts edition for the Routledge series Changing Images of Childhood, edited by Nicola Yelland).

Most significantly, the paper &amp;quot;Encounters with a Life(Less) Baby Doll: Rethinking Relations of Agency through a Collectively Lived Moment&amp;quot; that I wrote as a result of this project has contributed to a growing scholarly conversation that is seeking to re-theorise agency in relation to the human/and non-human world. My work was published in a special issue of the Journal of Contemporary Issues in Early Childhood, that called for work on &amp;quot;Children's Relations to the More-than-Human World&amp;quot; guest edited by Affrica Taylor, Veronica Pacinin-Ketchabaw, and Mindy Blaise. The paper takes an event when a small group of children encounter a baby doll as its starting point. By connecting this shared lived moment with Deleuze and Guattari's idea of machinic production and collective enunciation three significant shifts in thinking take place. First, accepted notions of agency are called into question. Second, the boundary between adult artistic production and children's productions become entangled so that both 'child' and 'adult' are decentred at key moments. Third, distinctions between object and human are dissolved so that boundary marking between things and people also becomes complicated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They contribute on ongoing discussions about the potential of documentation as a reflective tool, both for artists, as well as early years practitioners.
