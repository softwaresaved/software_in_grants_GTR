The focus of the case study was on whole school values as a justification for activities and investigated how well the school prepared children to be good citizens in a liberal, plural democracy. In particular, innovative approaches to the exploration of its values (Honourable Purpose, Humility, Compassion, Integrity, Accountability, Courage, Determination) in English, History, Geography and RE were reported. These values underpinned: 1) the school ethos intended by leaders 2) arts and humanities teachers' pedagogy, from lesson planning to assessment, and 3) students' aspirations and learning through the arts and humanities. Although the original findings were published in the Oxford Review of Education (Pike, 2010) and have generated debate (ORE, August, 2011) dissemination to a wider public and professional audience would significantly increase the value and impact of the original research. The case study of Trinity Academy is directly relevant to significant shifts in several areas of education policy under the Coalition Government. The introduction of the English Baccalaureate ('EBacc') that assigns greater importance to humanities subjects, especially history, marks a shift towards an emphasis on these more 'academic' subjects at a time when the importance of 'citizenship' as a subject appears to be in decline. Yet the need to foster good citizens remains and the case study demonstrates how 'citizenship' can be addressed through value-laden arts and humanities subjects. Trinity Academy's approaches to fostering responsibility, community and good citizenship have been so successful that knowledge transfer could have significant impact. The project would allow us to gauge the degree to which the emphasis upon selected core values, documented in the original research, might inform practice in other schools, especially in challenging contexts. Knowledge exchange and active dissemination will be achieved through hosting and events and producing resources for different end users. By the end of the award we would provide school leaders, teachers and parents with events and resources relevant to their needs. We will host events at Trinity Academy near Doncaster which is accessible for those travelling to the events, being just off Jct 6 of the M18. We will also produce DVDs and resources to support leaders, teachers and parents. The focus will be on how whole school values inform leadership, teaching and parenting with special reference to learning in the arts and humanities and the role of these especially value-laden subjects in mediating school ethos. Students at the Trinity Academy will address visiting school leaders, teachers and parents about their perceptions of school leadership, teaching and parenting and what they believe best supports their learning. We anticipate wide and positive coverage of our events which will be innovative and newsworthy as 14-19-year-old students will play a key role in teaching school leaders, teachers and parents. Headlines along the lines of 'Children Teach Parents' or 'Pupils Teach Head Teachers' are envisaged. Trinity Academy now belongs to the ULT family of academies, the largest in the country, and the resources and national profile of the ULT will undoubtedly facilitate impact as will the active support and channels of the Chair of the IAA which represents 600 academies. The focus in this dissemination and impact project is upon the religious sources of inclusive values which are endorsed by students and teachers alike and which support good citizenship and high expectations for young people in a liberal society regardless of background.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit the public, taxpayers, education professionals and policy-makers by translating findings from recently published academic research into accessible language and disseminating it through a series of specifically tailored events and proven communication channels. As few parents, teachers or school leaders read journals such as the Oxford Review of Education, there is a need for wider dissemination than was previously foreseen. Such dissemination is essential to sharing good practice among teachers and school leaders serving social priority areas. In demonstrating the importance of research into values generally and the arts and humanities in particular in schools, children's personal and aesthetic response and growth as humane citizens, will be supported. The success of Trinity Academy is notable not simply due to the scale and speed of its transformation but because it has done so by privileging the arts and humanities and promoting an ethical and inclusive approach. Other children and communities in social priority areas stand to benefit from disseminating 'best practice'. The area served by the case study school has been ranked in the worst 10% nationally for unemployment and in the worst 4% in the country as regards educational attainment with health levels falling within the worst 5% nationally. If the experiences of school leaders and teachers bringing about transformation in such a context can be of benefit to school leaders and teachers serving similarly challenging contexts, especially in the North, social mobility may be supported. If leaders and teachers gain insights and return from Trinity with the attitude ' If it can be done there it can be done where I am' other children in other areas are likely benefit. For policy makers to find new policy ideas and for parents to support the work being done in school by simultaneously emphasising core values in the home environment, represents significant and innovative impact potential. End users will benefit as each event will be supported by high quality DVD material and resources which can equip and envision beyond the events themselves. Networks and contacts are likely to be fostered over the longer term. Trinity Academy is part of the ULT 'family' and all of its academies serve challenging contexts, over half of which are in the North. Significantly, the ULT singles out 'the arts' as one of the important areas in which it is committed to 'bringing out the best in everyone' and will play a key role in the dissemination process as a project partner. Trinity Academy also belongs to the ESF whose Chief Executive is Chair of the IAA, the voice of over 600 academies, and dissemination will be facilitated by the ESF as project partner and via IAA channels. Trinity Academy itself is devoting significant resources and staff time as project partner and will show how significant and well-managed public/private investment in schools generally and the arts and humanities in particular has the potential to increase the effectiveness of public services and policy for the common good. A realistic timescale for the realization of benefits is one year to establish links between Trinity and other schools and five years for impacting schools seeking similar transformation. The economic and social regeneration of social priority areas supported by the provision of high quality schooling is necessarily longer term, as is achieving greater social mobility through children from such areas being the first in their family to attend university. By emphasizing the importance of the arts and humanities in schooling and citizenship there is the potential to enhance the quality of life of schools and the communities they serve as well as economic competitiveness of the North by contributing to regeneration. This project delivers impact collaboration (people exchange, staff and skills) for 3 significant user communities, supported by 3 partners involved at the design stage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23961</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Sociological Association Conference at Kings College London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA372C5E-94B6-49F1-9065-FB216D6770E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We presented the following paper: Beyond 'Grit': Character Education, Moral Virtues, and the Chronicles of Narnia - Thomas Lickona, SUNY, USA, Mark Pike, University of Leeds, Peter Hart, University of Leeds.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/cmci/eventrecords/2016/Grit-Programme-11th-July.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Core Values, Student Learning and School Transformation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1F0F0AC7-CD4B-47E7-AAB6-7FEF322FB458</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Booklet (46pp with DVD) including resources for one-day conference on 9th May 2012 distributed to school leaders and teachers.

Prof Mark Pike presented on the parental involvement in the project. He described how we are engaging with parents through seminars and home activities that students take the lead on. He also described some of our initial findings from interviews with parents and carers. While the level of influence parents have over the character of teenagers is currently an aspect of some debate in academia, this project is empirically testing the hypothesis that the students who have greater parental help with developing their character will show greater change in their knowledge and application of the virtues. At the moment, our initial reflections on the data collected suggest that parents certainly believe they are very important to the student's character development, and many have commented that this curriculum has aided in increasing the depth of conversations parents are able to engage in with their children.

At the same session, Dr Peter Hart began a more speculative philosophical piece asking whether home life could be considered a MacIntyrian practice (a regular human activity, rooted in our social nature, that offers opportunity to develop the virtues and leads towards human flourishing) and began to expound on whether character education is itself a practice, or better understood as an 'internal good' to the practice of teaching. In our pilot study we recognised that the home was a particularly important site for ethical reflection.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contributed to 'A Framework for Character Education in Schools', launched at the Jubilee Centre for Character and Virtues Consultation on Character and Initial Teacher Education at Windsor Castle.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92F1E6FC-0AF6-4572-AF60-2B789E3E3636</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr M Pike was recruited as a consultant prior this event to help prepare 'A Framework for Character Education in Schools'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Religion and Education: The Case of Trinity Academy</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DD6AFC0-3890-4D7A-BF9F-1A8B5536BD8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New Forms of Public Religion Conference at St John's College, Cambridge 5th-7th September 2012</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011,2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk for Christian Concern, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>25DA8A1F-36D4-416A-9B7A-98AD3314D86C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Irrigating Deserts</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Raising Attainment, Nurturing Values and Increasing Social Mobility in a School of Character 2008-2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>46D599C6-D41C-4279-8B2A-34B5A4AD78BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited presentation at the conference Character and Public Policy: Educating for an Ethical Life at the Jubilee Centre for Character and Values, Birmingham University (13th-16th December 2012)

In our paper, we presented the latest findings from our Narnian Virtues research, investigating the relationship between character and English literature, with a focus on the influence and perspectives of parents. This paper reports how families are engaging in the Narnian Virtues character education project and we specifically focused on the views of parents. Initial highlights from the phone interviews with parents showed that the 'Turkish Delight' activity - where families write down something that tempts them the most - as the activity that resonated with them the most. This echoed our pilot year, where there was something about how reflecting on their own weaknesses helped them recognise everyday actions as being ethical. Simple behaviours, like turning on the X-Box or picking up their phone, began to be seen as ethical actions: that it reflected on their self-control, honesty, and wisdom. Analysis of this data will begin in earnest spring 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.jubileecentre.ac.uk/userfiles/jubileecentre/pdf/conference-papers/CharacterWisdomandVirtue/Hart_PandPike_MandLickona_T.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>136000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Narnian Virtues (Character Education)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The John Templeton Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0265D2BB-A369-49C8-91DA-CC5B1AB7ADF2</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>934901</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Narnian Virtues (Character Education)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The John Templeton Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>60516</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>7AECB2A7-2694-4345-9654-DC159CDE9C55</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Impact and dissemination was two-fold: 1) upon practitioners and the local community and 2) within the academic community.

Response was overwhelmingly positive and school leaders have incorporated best practice from Trinity into their own institutions. A research report targeted at parents and the local community was produced entitled: How can we help our children and young people to succeed at school and in life?

The main focus was on Trinity Academy in South Yorkshire, which was the subject of the case study. During 2007-2008, fieldwork (lesson observation and recording, interviews with leaders, teachers, parents and Year 9 students as well as surveys) was carried out over the equivalent of 3 weeks. Findings emerged from qualitative data that were synthesized with a quantitative survey of over a thousand participants (leaders, teachers and 14-year-old students) in the ESF schools. 

A dissemination conference was held at the University of Leeds on October 21st 2008. Research findings were also presented in 2008 at the US Character Education Partnership national conference in Washington DC; at the Association for Moral Education conference at Notre Dame University and at the BERA (British Education Research Association) conference at Warwick University in 2009. Findings were also disseminated in articles published in the Oxford Review of Education, Management in Education, Journal of Beliefs and Values - studies in religion and education and Journal of Research on Character Education. Follow-On funding from the AHRC's Religion and Society Programme was awarded for 2011-12 and provided the unique opportunity to re-engage with students in Year 13 (aged 18) at Trinity Academy who took part in the original research in 2008 when they were in Year 9 (aged 14) and to disseminate the findings of the original research to school leaders, teachers and parents.

Over the course of the original research project, the researcher recorded several semi-structured interviews with teachers and school leaders. At least one interview (lasting around half an hour) was conducted with each of the Principals and Vice-Principals of each school during several days of fieldwork at each. Over three months these interviews were transcribed and a thematic, content analysis of transcripts revealed dominant themes. A qualitative approach informed by ethnography previously used in schools with a religious foundation was employed. Such analysis revealed the ethos as intended. Subsequently, the researcher carried out interviews with teachers of RE, History and English and conducted focus groups with 14-year-olds, without teachers present, to generate initial, tentative, hypotheses about the ethos as experienced. 

Finally, all schools were re-visited and an anonymous survey of the 543 14-year-olds (Year 9), 311 teachers and 11 Principals and Vice Principals in the three ESF schools was undertaken by the author in order to ascertain the extent to which the views expressed in interviews and focus groups were shared more widely. The views of focus groups were used in the questionnaire that employed a simple Likert scale; returns were received from all 865 confidential questionnaires as arrangements were made for students to be 'off-timetable' for a lesson to allow them to complete these and teachers completed their questionnaires during an afternoon devoted to INSET. The author was present on both occasions to collect them personally and to assure students and teachers that their anonymity would be preserved. For the Follow-On project focus groups were held with sixth formers who were re-surveyed using the same questions they had responded to when 14-year-olds. The quantitative and qualitative phases of the project were therefore reciprocally connected.
