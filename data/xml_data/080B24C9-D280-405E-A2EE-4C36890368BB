Centuries</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L007010/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>When Darwin was developing his theories of evolution he read avidly in popular natural history magazines and sought out information from an army of almost 2000 correspondents. Such engagement with a wide public in the construction of
science became increasingly difficult with the development of professional, and highly specialised science, but the emergence of 'citizen science' projects has suggested a new way forward.
With the creation of vast data sets in contemporary science, there is a need for a new army of volunteers to help classify and analyse the information. The Zooniverse platform, started in 2007 with 'Galaxy Zoo', now has over 800,000
participants who contribute to projects from astrophysics to climate science. Significant discoveries have already been made by these volunteers in the field of astronomy. Yet, the structures by which these volunteers might engage with
professional science, and through which scientists themselves might draw upon their findings, are not clear, and researchers on the project have been turning to nineteenth-century models of communication to find ways of harnessing
this huge popular interest in order to increase the rate of scientific progress.
The information revolution in our own age has parallels in the nineteenth century which saw an explosion of print, and journal publishing; in 1800 there were only around 100 science periodicals, but by 1900 this had jumped to 10,000
worldwide. The project brings together historical and literary research in the nineteenth century with contemporary scientific practice, looking at the ways in which patterns of popular communication and engagement in nineteenth-century science can offer models for current practice. The research is timely since the digital revolution, and open-access publishing, are about to change forever the processes and forms of scientific communication and exchange.
The project will be based at the Universities of Oxford and Leicester, in partnership with three of our most significant institutions: the Natural History Museum; the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons, and the Royal Society. Researchers will draw on their historic collections, uncovering the extraordinary range of largely forgotten science journals of the nineteenth century, from the Magazine of Natural History (one of Darwin's favourites), to Recreative Science, or Hardwicke's Science Gossip: an Illustrated Medium of Interchange and Gossip for Students and Lovers of Nature. They will also work with these institutions' science communities, addressing questions about the creation and circulation of knowledge in the digital age, and looking at innovative ways of breaking through the public/professional divide. The Zooniverse will extend the range of its work, creating four new citizen science projects which will both accelerate the rate of scientific growth in these areas, and add an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 to the dedicated ranks of citizen scientists. Drawing on the historical research, it will also develop new tools to enable better systems of exchange between professional science, and this growing army of volunteers. As part of the project there will be public symposia in the Natural History Museum, the Royal Society and the Royal College of Surgeons, as well as an exhibition in the Hunterian Museum, and a performance lecture by Professor Marcus du Sautoy. Science has suffered in the public mind from its seeming aloofness and impenetrability. This partnership between humanities and science researchers aims to break down some of those barriers, and to create a truly productive public engagement with science which will enhance the ongoing development of scientific practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will have an exceptionally large range of beneficiaries.
1. It aims to raise to a million, or more, the numbers of non-scientists who participate in the development of scientific research on the Zooniverse platform. Early investigations have shown that many of these volunteers on the 'citizen
science' platforms have no prior experience of science at all, but once their interest is developed they can go on to engage in quite sophisticated further research and calculations. The projects are pitched in such a way as to make them
accessible for all ages, from teenagers through to those in their nineties, and for citizens across the world.

2. The website developed to accompany the research into nineteenth-century science publishing will appeal to an equally broad spectrum of beneficiaries, from amateur naturalists, or astronomers, to members of the public interested in the history of medicine.

3. The talk in the Natural History Museum's popular 'Nature Live' series will be targeted explicitly at school-age children and families, and together with the website could form the basis of school project work.

4. The digitisation of key titles by the Biodiversity Heritage Library will ensure a permanent legacy, which can be enjoyed by future generations who might be tempted by the intriguing Science Gossip, or the Magazine of Natural History. The attraction of these journals is that they are written for a broad audience and need no specialist knowledge; they are also often beautifully illustrated.

5. The exhibition at the Hunterian Museum will give the museum a chance to open up some of its rarely viewed collections, and will enhance public interest in, and understanding of, the development of medicine in the nineteenth century.

6. The public symposia at the Natural History Museum and at the Royal College of Surgeons will offer further opportunities for members of the public to engage with the research and to gain new insight into the 'hidden history' of science
development.

7. The performance lecture by Marcus du Sautoy at the Royal Society, would bring new audiences into that institution, and raise the public profile of questions relating to science and the processes of scientific discovery.

The benefits will be cultural and educational, as detailed above, but also economic. For citizen scientists, who were perhaps turned off from science at school, or had to drop science subjects too early in their education, the project will offer a way to stimulate enthusiasm, and develop new capacities, from detailed focus and application through to the development of complex mathematical skills. These skills will be highly transferable in the labour market; the added
bonus of a sense of achievement, and personal potential, could also lead to a greater sense of ambition and empowerment in the job market. The economic benefits will also extend to science, which will be able to draw on an ever increasing pool of skilled labour to analyse the datasets that are being developed. Finally, as the name suggests, the practice of 'citizen science' will bring a new sense of citizenship and communal engagement. The findings with reference to publication patterns will also be of value in contributing to the current complex debates about online publishing, and the relative merits of commercial and non-commercial models of information exchange. They will have an impact both on commercial science publishing, and also that of scholarly societies, and other public organisations which publish science-related journals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1564148</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>WeNeedUs is an online artwork inspired by and using data from the Zooniverse, commissioned by the Open Data Institute.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B5A2E2C-9DDA-4935-8BC5-3EE682829418</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The artwork obtained significant press coverage, and has received significant traffic.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>WeNeedUs</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://weneedus.org</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Following the success of the Public Health Private Pain evening event of medical history and drama held in May 2016, another event was planned in collaboration with the Pegasus Theatre and Museum of the History of Science.

The event recreated a Victorian magic lantern show with historical actors presenting a Victorian science lecture with slides on subjects including dinosaurs and geology. After the magic lantern show, the audience members were able to take a closer look at the magic lantern and ask questions of the presenters. The event introduced the audience to nineteenth century science, magic lanterns and also the research activities of the Constructing Scientific Communities project. 

Lea Beiermann, an intern at the University of Leicester who took part in the event, wrote a guest blog post for the project website about her internship which included a report of the event with video. The blog post and film is available at the URL below.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5CB08279-73D6-4E3A-8493-7FC0EA0DC51E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Feedback questionnaires were completed by some of the audience members who were asked if the event had influenced their thinking about the topic presented. Comments included that the event was insightful, eye-opening, educational and entertaining. It increased awareness of nineteenth century political issues, highlighted how magic lantern shows disseminated information and enabled engagement with science in Victorian times. The event enabled a greater insight into Victorian culture and society, the presenters being in Victorian costume gave the feeling of going back in time and those who had no knowledge of magic lanterns before the event found it extremely interesting and stimulated interest in finding out more about the subject. One audience member who worked in the arts and heritage sector commented that they were inspired to run a magic lantern event for children as a result of the event.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Science and the Victorian Public (Being Human Festival 2016)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://conscicom.org/2017/01/09/a-lamp-in-one-hand-and-a-measuring-tape-in-the-other/#more-1871</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In February 2017, the project started a You Tube channel to put all films of our events in one place.

Dr Sally Frampton and Ms Alison Moulds from the project worked with the museum's team on putting the exhibition together. 

The exhibition traced the history of vaccination from the late 18th century through to the present day through exhibits and multi-media displays including public information films from the 1950s. The exhibition charted the changing relationship between medical professionals and the public and the controversies surrounding the subject. It also highlighted the contributions of lay people to the development of vaccination and how the public have resisted its use. 

Extracts from the public information films were made into this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jltqCd2cXDY

The exhibition was widely advertised by the project and the Hunterian Museum on websites, and via social media channels. It was extremely successful attracting thousands of visitors. 

A public symposium along with other public engagement activities were organised as part of the exhibition - these along with blog posts written by members of the project team about the exhibition are reported separately and in more detail under the Engagement Activities section. 
The public engagement events were all held at the Hunterian Museum as follows: 

7 May 2016: People Powered Medicine Symposium 
12 May 2016: Museums at Night Event: Vaccination, Yes or No? 
17 May 2016: Lunchtime Lecture on Edward Jenner 
2 June 2016: Snot, Sick and Scabs (event specifically for children)</gtr:description><gtr:id>7B697CD4-B9CB-4D6B-BA27-4904D78A563E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition attracted a large number of visitors to the Hunterian Museum and was a highly successful public engagement event. The work of the Constructing Scientific Communities project was advertised to a wider audience, and the visitor feedback collated by the museum and kept on file at the project was extremely positive. 

The Hunterian Museum have confirmed that there was a total of 38,571 visitors to the museum over the period of the Vaccination exhibition. It was not possible to ascertain how many of these visitors went into the exhibition space, but a significant number will have done so. The figure of 38,571 is counted as the total of families, school visits, higher and further education visits, adult individuals, children and organised groups) 

The exhibition appealed to all ages and was enjoyed by children and adults. Several children left comment cards that they found it fascinating. The comments from adults were that it was a fascinating, well-presented and informative exhibition which communicated the history of vaccination and contemporary issues on the subject extremely well. Exhibits such as letters of Edward Jenner, and the photographs of smallpox were found particularly interesting by all ages. 

In addition to the general public, the exhibition was visited by medical professionals at all career stages. Comments from a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons included that it was one of the best exhibitions he had ever seen. One visitor was a senior figure from the UN who worked on the UN's efforts to end malaria and left a comment that it was fascinating and important to remember the lessons of history regarding vaccinations.

The event looked at the public and private nature of bodies in the world of medicine and with the assistance of professional actors from the Pegasus Theatre in Oxford, dramatised developments in this field from the 18th century to the present day. Scenes included an extract from Shelagh Stephenson's play An Experiment with an Air-pump (1998) looking at medical ethics issues and genetics; George Bernard Shaw's The Doctor's Dilemma (1906) which also explored medical ethics; a reading from Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts (1881) of a scene where a character has to tell his mother that he has syphilis; two World War I poems by Sassoon and Owen regarding shell shock; a rendition of a historical anti-vaccination song; an extract from Joe Penhall's play Blue/Orange (2000) concerning race and mental health issues. 

The event was attended by 40 people. The event was advertised widely online and via the project and museum's Twitter accounts. The evening was filmed and the films are available on a blog post written for the project website by Dr Berris Charnley about the event. This can be viewed at the URL below. The videos are also available on You Tube tagged and identified for returning in searches.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4CA0C147-FEF8-4A53-9716-41ED89AEAD0D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event was a highly successful collaboration between University researchers, the Pegasus Theatre, other institutions and museum and cultural arts partners. It was an excellent example of linking the Constructing Scientific Communities project with University and Museum priorities for knowledge exchange and impact. The event included academics from the University of Oxford and also Birkbeck University of London, which furthered institutional collaborations. The event strengthened links between the Pegasus Theatre, Museum of the History of Science and the University of Oxford. As a result of this very successful event, another was planned with the museum and Pegasus Theatre for later in 2016 (see entry for the Don't Panic event in November 2016 as part of the AHRC's Being Human Festival). Other future collaborations for public engagement events will also be discussed. It was clear after the event that innovative presentation worked very well, and this will be developed further for future event planning. The Director of the Museum of the History of Science was impressed by the event and has invited the project to work with them again in future. 

The event also publicised the work of the Constructing Scientific Communities project and introduced it to a new audience. 

The audience were asked to complete feedback questionnaires at the end of the evening. All responses rated the event as Excellent, and the audience was attracted mainly by the topic, the venue and the drama nature of the event. The feedback showed that attendees were interested in finding out more about Zooniverse having heard about the project's work, the event was enjoyable, fun and well put together and was in an excellent and interesting venue. The combination of academic and drama was enjoyed, as was the immediacy and interdisciplinarity of the event. One audience member commented that the event was a perfect example of how the past can inform the present and how historical research can shape policy today. Generally there was interest in finding out more about the subjects covered including the anti-vaccination movement. One comment was that the academics and actors did a brilliant job, the event was well planned, the presenters and actors were engaging and open with just the right amount of information delivered, and it was one of the best events that person had seen at the museum. This person felt that it would put future visits to the museum in a new light and they would think more about the human context. Seeing drama first hand was also highlighted as a very positive aspect of the evening's programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Public Health and Private Pain a Night of Medical History and Drama</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://conscicom.org/2016/10/17/public-health-and-private-pain-a-night-of-medical-history-and-drama-2/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Natural History Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Natural History Museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>7CA90FBD-5466-4F51-9C28-90FE802C2789</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Orchid Field Guide (distributed across UK)

This was an event open to the public, but was also part of the programme for an academic one-day symposium organised by the Constructing Scientific Communities project. The symposium was entitled The End of the Scientific Journal? Transformations in Publishing and the event concluded with Professor Lintott's public lecture. Therefore the audience was a mixture of academics (some international) who attended the symposium, and members of the public. All of the Constructing Scientific Communities project team were also in attendance. 

The End of the Scientific Journal was the subject of a blog post written by one of the participants, Cameron Neylon and available at: http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-end-of-the-journal-what-has-changed-what-stayed-the-same/

A Storify of tweets by Dr Berris Charnley from the event was collated at https://storify.com/IPBio/the-end-of-the-scientific-journal-transformations-

Professor Lintott's lecture was filmed and streamed live. The video is available at the URL below. The Royal Society have confirmed that around 25 people watched it live on the day, and since then there have been 574 viewings (information up to date as of 2 February 2016) 

A questionnaire was handed out by the Royal Society to the audience, and one third of the questionnaires were returned at the end. The results were Topic and Format 95% good or excellent, and Speaker Expertise and Communication Skills 100% good or excellent. Audience members signed up for various updates from the Royal Society as follows: 43% for public events, 14% for scientific conferences, 5% for fundraising, 19% for science policy updates, 9% for education. 

Comments on the talk were excellent speaker, wouldn't have minded a longer lecture, excellent lecture delivered with confidence. 

The audience expressed an interest in future topics, namely light and sound, cycles of evolution, technology, big data, internet of things, string theory and medical and scientific content to appeal to the younger generation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://royalsociety.org/events/2015/11/science-million-people/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project Website Blog Post: Going Into Rooms and Saying Things</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AADF6CE7-A6BC-4E7D-B159-77996B13E2DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Berris Charnley produced a blog post for the project website &amp;quot;Going Into Rooms and Saying Things&amp;quot; discussing several recent conference presentations he had made and his research on Eleanor Ormerod.

The YSJ is the world's peer review science journal written and edited exclusively by 12-20 year olds. It publishes research papers and articles in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics and in 2016 celebrated its tenth anniversary. The day comprised two keynote speakers, and a programme of exciting workshops, together with a poster competition for students to showcase their own research projects. The event was sold out to capacity and attended by around 140 students aged 14-18 from across the country together with their teachers. 

The Constructing Scientific Communities project was well represented at the conference. Professor Sally Shuttleworth gave one of the welcome addresses and highlighted the work of the project in her opening remarks. Professor Chris Lintott was one of the event's two keynote speakers, giving two talks to the students on The Universe Through A Million Eyes, which highlighted how they could take part in Zooniverse's citizen science projects to contribute to future scientific discoveries. Zooniverse itself was represented by Grant Miller, who ran one of the day's workshops on the subject of People Powered Research. A full listing of the programme for the conference is available on the YSJ website. 

The day received a lot of excellent publicity via live tweets which were collated into a Storify and tweeted further. The Storify is available on the project website at the URL below which contains a link to the YSJ website for a conference report and photographs.

This was an event organised as part of the Vaccination Medicine and the Masses exhibition and was open to medical humanities researchers, medical practitioners and the general public. The event was CPD accredited for medical practitioners. The symposium programme was organised chronologically, and discussed patient and public involvement in medicine and healthcare from 1800 to the present. It brought together historical and contemporary perspectives to consider the relationships between medical professionals and the public. The symposium also included a private viewing of the Vaccination Medicine and the Masses exhibition which had opened the week before. 

The day opened with introductions by Professor Sally Shuttleworth, and David Ward, Vice President of the RCS. The first keynote was by Ruth Richardson of King's College London who spoke on the Carer as a Critical Friend. The first panel on Patient Preference in Late 19th and Early 20th Century Medicine comprised papers by Kristin Hussey of Queen Mary University of London on Victorian eye surgery, patient choice and the 1893 trial of the Indian oculists, and Claire Brock of the University of Leicester on Patient Resistance in the Early 20th Century. The second panel on Patient Communities, Patient Consumers: Exercising People Power in Post-War Britain comprised papers by Roberta Bivins of the University of Warwick on Building Communities, Changing Practice and Alex Mold of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on Patient-Consumers? Patient Organisations and Health Consumerism in Post-war Britain. The final panel on Bodies, Patients and Publishing: Medicine and the Public Today comprised papers by Tom Gillingwater of the University of Edinburgh on Bringing Anatomy Out of the Shadows, and Rosamund Snow of the University of Oxford and British Medical Journal on From body parts to curriculum setters - the changing role of the patient. The final keynote was given by Christopher McKevitt of King's College London on Symbolic acts, strategic gains: patient and public involvement in the English NHS and the day closed with reflections by Nicholas Markham of the Royal College of Surgeons, Christopher McKevitt, Ruth Richardson and Professor Shuttleworth. 

Following the symposium, Dr Sally Frampton and Alison Moulds carried out interviews with some of the speakers and attendees, and records of these interviews have been kept on file. Questions included whether their views on public participation in medicine had been impacted by the day's discussions, and whether there is anything they will do differently in their work afterwards. Feedback from these interviews included that the range of papers in chronological order was a good idea; the day was fascinating and raised awareness about the current interest in hearing patient voices; the conference was outstanding value; a good mix of topics were covered; a determination to incorporate more patient and public involvement in work; reinforcement of the sense of the patient as agent; strengthened resolve to do more work on the social history of patients and practioner interaction; good networking opportunity and a chance to make new contacts which would benefit work and research; a change in viewpoint from regarding the patient as a living patient to regarding the patient as such from conception through to death; the connections between the 19th and 21st century issues were made very well; very educational day; greater and increased awareness of the work of the British Medical Journal in developing policies on patient involvement; generally very thought provoking. A comment received by the Royal College of Surgeons from one doctor who attended, was that he would be completely changing how he records his patient notes in future as a direct result of the discussions at the symposium.

Conversations on Nature was an evening of talks and activities for the general public at the University of Leicester, and was specifically designed for public engagement as an introduction to citizen science, its history, and how people today can contribute to scientific research. The event was attended by a mixture of the public and University of Leicester staff and students, all of whom were an interested and engaged audience keen to ask questions and have discussions with the project team. 

The event recreated the Victorian conversazione which brought science to the wider public and the event aimed to do the same to engage a modern audience with our research. Natural history illustrations from periodicals and and books of the period were on display for the public to look at, including Science Gossip and The Geologist. Having actual Victorian periodicals for the public to leaf through themselves proved a very successful format. More delicate items were on display only. 

The main focus of the evening was a magic lantern show, where members of the project team, some dressed in Victorian costume, displayed images from natural history, science, maps and microscope slides. A blog post was written for the project website detailing the event with photographs, for which the URL is given below.

We had very positive feedback from the audience - collected through a questionnaire. The University of Leicester library was able to highlight some of its excellent periodical collection, and there was increased participation between the university and the Natural History Museum, who had participated in the event. The event, in augmented form, was also produced again at the Royal Society in 2015.

Prof Dawson and Dr Belknap spoke on Different Perspectives: Multi Disciplinary Use of the BHL - The Case of Science Gossip. 

The feedback afterwards was that Prof Dawson and Dr Belkap's presentation was pitch perfect and fitted in very well with the other presentations which together gave an overview of the BHL's work past and present.

People Power was an evening of citizen science talks and activities for the general public at the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford. The event was specifically designed for public engagement, as an introduction to citizen science and to suggest ways in which people can participate. The evening was aimed at schoolchildren at GCSE and A Level age, as well as members of the general public. The age range of attendees was from 14-70s. 

Professor Sally Shuttleworth introduced the evening, and provided a brief overview of the Constructing Scientific Communities project. Two short talks followed on the history of citizen science - Dr Sally Frampton's talk focused on the role of the public in the history of vaccination, and Dr Will Abberley from the Faculty of English discussed amateur animal psychology in Victorian Britain. Dr Victoria van Hyning from the Zooniverse team then talked about 21st century citizen science projects. Interactive activities took place around the museum - Dr Abberley ran an activity on animal psychology, the Zooniverse team enabled people to try citizen science projects for themselves and Dr Sally Frampton ran the Unbelievable Truth of Medical History game which invited the public to decide whether medical history statements were fact or fiction. The evening ended with a question and answer session with the project team. A blog post with video footage from the event is available on the project website for which the URL is below. 

The evening was very successful and extremely positive feedback questionnaires were collected in from the audience afterwards. Audience members comments showed that the format of short talks, engaging activities and opportunity for discussion and questions worked very well. Comments included that participants were inspired to find out more about the topics presented, take part in citizen science projects, and enjoyed learning about historical and contemporary citizen science.

Increased interest in participation in Zooniverse citizen science projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://conscicom.org/2014/12/02/people-power-at-the-museum-of-the-history-of-science-oxford/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ada Lovelace Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>832B8183-7F7D-45EE-929B-714D1562BB3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project co-organised and was a sponsor of the Ada Lovelace Symposium, held at the University of Oxford to celebrate the 200th birthday of Ada Lovelace. Other sponsors included Google and the London Mathematical Society. 

A hugely successful two day symposium on 9th and 10th December 2015 was attended by around 300 delegates including leading figures in the history of computing, digital technology companies, academics, students and also interested members of the public. The presentations were interdisciplinary and included computer scientists, mathematicians, graphic artist and historians. Professor Shuttleworth chaired a panel during the symposium, and members of the project team (Project administrator Alyson Slade, Drs Sally Frampton and Jim O'Donnell) ran a stall to publicise the Constructing Scientific Communities projecty and demonstrate Zooniverse citizen science projects. On 8th December, a workshop was organised for graduate students and early career researchers on the cultural legacy of Ada Lovelace 

Professor Shuttleworth's discussions with Sydney Padua, the graphic artist she met at the symposium, have led to plans for Sydney to give a seminar for the project on Lovelace and Babbage soon and also for her to work with us to produce some graphic art work for the project in the near future.

The talk was given by novelist and scientist Professor Sunetra Gupta, and discussed how scientists write and why. The talk included a panel discussion with historians of science who talked about how and why eminent scientists over the past 300 years kept a diary. The public talk followed an academic workshop on Scientific Diaries which was also co-organised by the project and Royal Society. The URL will be updated in due course when the film of the talk is available and published on the websites. 

The talk was attended by 62 people, some of these were the general public and others had stayed on from the earlier academic workshop. Feedback questionnaires were completed. The event was very successful and received very good feedback. Project leaflets were given to all attendees. 

The event was advertised on the project and Royal Society websites, social media accounts as well as to contacts and history of science mailing lists. 36% of the attendees who completed the questionnaires heard about the event via social media, 29% through word of mouth, 18% from the Royal Society website, 14% from another source and 4% from an online event listing. Respondents were asked to rate the topic, format, expertise of the speaker and communication skills of the speaker. Topic - 100% excellent/good, Format - 90% excellent/good, Expertise - 93% excellent/good and Communication - 93% excellent/good. No one ticked poor or very poor for any of the categories. 

Comments included: Enjoyed the personal view of science and the connections over time; Excellent - very interesting way to show the work of the research group in science history; Very interesting. The only suggestion for improvement was for audience questions after the first part of the talk. 

The project and the Royal Society will consider topics for similar jointly organised events in the future including the performance lecture event with Professor Marcus du Sautoy towards the end of the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://conscicom.org/2017/01/12/scientists-and-their-diaries-events-at-the-royal-society/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Constructing Scientific Communities: Project Website Visitor and Countries Data</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54444B06-4D85-4007-9CFE-A38FD4048E7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This entry is to record the statistics for the project website and its international reach.

The event was open to all so was attended by a wide range of people including schoolchildren, adults of all ages, researchers and academics. Dr Geoff Belknap took part in a soapbox style presentation, where he answered questions from the general public on the question of whether you need to be a professional to be a scientist. Representatives from the Zooniverse team also attended and demonstrated the Zooniverse projects on a large computer screen. This prompted questions and interest in participating in citizen science projects on Zooniverse.

Fun Palaces is a nationwide event which runs arts and science activities for the general public. Fun Palaces is a very family orientated event, and so the audience included children of all ages as well as adults. 

Zooniverse citizen science projects were demonstrated, the team put on a Victorian magic lantern show and had general discussions with the public about citizen science and the work of the Constructing Scientific Communities project. Project leaflets were available and distributed. 

The children were especially interested in the interactive elements of the event with the Zooniverse citizen science projects, asked lots of questions and were keen to talk to the project team members. Many of the parents also expressed interest in citizen science and asked the team about future project activities and ways in which their children could become involved in science activities generally in the Oxford area. The event was extremely successful in engaging the interest of children in particular.

All participants were members of the RCN and were led by Helen Donovan, the RCN's professional lead for public health with a specialism in immunisation and vaccination. A guided tour of the exhibition was given by Dr Frampton and Ms Moulds, and the group had discussions about the history of vaccinations and the objects on display. The group were all very interested in the history of vaccination and enjoyed sharing stories from their careers on the subject.

Further to the very successful format for the Conversations on Nature event at the University of Leicester in November 2014 (see separate report), the Twilight Science event again included a recreation of a Victorian conversazione and a magic lantern show of scientific images. As in Victorian times, this brought science to the wider general public. In addition, Twilight Science featured The Strolling Players, a history of science theatre group starring the project's Dr Geoff Belknap. The Strolling Players, in Victorian costume, performed a short play called 'The Tables Turned' which featured a debate on Victorian spiritualism.

Members of the Zooniverse team also demonstrated citizen science projects. 

There was a great deal of interest in the magic lantern by the audience members afterwards and members of the project team took part in questions and discussions afterwards. There was interest in participation in citizen science projects. 

A blog post on the event was written for the project website featuring photographs, for which the URL is given below.

'Impact' is thus built in to the very process of the research itself. For 'Orchid Observers' we worked with the country's expert Orchid Community to devise the field study. Preliminary analysis suggests that those taking part, photographing the orchids in the field, and then analysing them online, included a far wider constituency, many with little or no experience of orchids, or nature study. The online analysis of the historical herbarium sheets also brought in further contributors, as did the dedicated 'volunteering' days at the Natural History Museum, where individuals from a wide range of jobs and professions took time out to contribute to the project. The overall figures are impressive, with 1860 participants so far. The project reached an even greater number through excellent coverage in the media, including, for example, the BBC. Accuracy of identification, and transcription has also been very high, suggesting the potential for building on this model for drawing in large numbers of the general public into nature study, historic research and scientific practice. 

The second Zooniverse project, 'Science Gossip', developed in collaboration with the Missouri Botanical Garden, and the Biodiversity Heritage Library, has been hugely successful in drawing members of the public in to engage with the content and illustrations of natural history periodicals of the nineteenth century. The project received enthusiastic endorsement in a range of high-profile arenas, from Scientific American to Nature Conservancy and has been presented to a range of professional audiences, from museum professionals to the 'Taxonomic Data Working Group'. The Biodiversity Heritage Library was originally conceived as a scientific resource, and the work has made the materials far more visible and accessible for scientists; it has also, however, drawn new audiences from across the globe who have engaged with the beautiful, and intriguing illustrations and articles in these largely forgotten sources. Participation has been worldwide, with 9126 contributors so far, with India and Brazil, for example, featuring in the top ten countries. One key feature of the site is the 'Talk' function, which allows participants to discuss their findings with each other, and the project moderator, leading to new streams of historical research initiated by participants (13,774 posts so far from 680 participants). The hidden history of female illustrators is being uncovered in this way. Preliminary analysis of the discussion forum on the site suggests that people in the creative industries have found the site particularly useful. The Missouri Botanical Gardens have highlighted cases of individuals who have drawn on the images from the Biodiversity Heritage Library for art, wallpaper design, and fashion. 

From April to September the project mounted a major exhibition on the history of vaccination at the Hunterian Museum, Royal College of Surgeons, with 38,571 visitors to the museum during this period. Drawing on our research, it placed contemporary controversies around MMR in the context of riots and protests against vaccination in the nineteenth century, and recovered stunning early photographic depictions of families with smallpox, used in public education displays over a century ago. Feedback, from all ages, and from members of the medical professions as well as general public, was uniformly positive ('one of the best exhibitions I have ever seen' - a surgeon). A senior figure from the UN, who had worked on combatting malaria, found the historical dimension particularly illuminating and important. We reached a wide range of audiences through a range of associated events, from 'Snot, Sick and Scabs', with interactive games for school children to introduce them to cells, bacteria and viruses, through to a Museum at Night event which included early public health films, performances of Victorian anti-vaccination songs, as well as talks. A symposium, 'People Powered Medicine' brought historians and medical practitioners together to discuss the ways in which patients and members of the public could be involved in medical delivery. One medic commented in feedback that he would now change the way in which took patient notes in future. 

One aim of the project is to break down the perception that science is only done by adults, in labs. To this end, we hosted the annual conference of the Young Scientists' Journal, the only science journal written and edited entirely by students still at school, at St Anne's College, Oxford, bringing 180 young people to the university for workshops and talks (with a keynote lecture by Co-I Professor Chris Lintott), to explore how science can be opened up to the young, not merely as an area to be studied, but also to be practiced. 

The research of the project has been presented in a wide range of venues, and to audiences of all ages, from talks at the Royal Society, with live webcasts, through to 'Fun Palaces' and Natural History Museum events designed for children and families. We have also given a number of magic lantern shows, recreating the magic of nineteenth-century events, and run two highly successful events combining drama and discussion, in conjunction with the Pegasus Theatre, Oxford, and the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. The two events, 'Public Health, Private Pain', and 'Don't Panic! Promises and Threats of Science and Technology' were sell-out events, using drama, interactive games, and discussion with academics and actors to explore social and ethical dilemmas posed by science and medicine, both past and present. The format was immensely successful, and has suggested the power of collaboration between theatre professionals and academics to produce profound, multi-level engagement with some of the key issues of our time.

Overall, the project has had decisive impacts on professional and expert (but non-professional) communities in medicine and ecology, and has opened up new avenues for partnerships with Museums. It has proved particularly successful in drawing members of the public into the arena of science, breaking down barriers, and opening up possibilities of participating in scientific practice to thousands who would previously have felt that science was not for them.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BCE0C360-62FD-4A3F-8F7E-45C2E7F4BF4F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project is both contributing to the development of scientific communities in the present, and exploring their construction in the past. Research has uncovered, in the nineteenth century, overlapping networks of 'citizen scientists' in such fields as meteorology, astronomy, public health and environment, and economic entomology, all of which anticipate contemporary scientific concerns, with the historic data now contributing, for example, to current climate change research. Other areas covered in the nineteenth century include the role of the numerous natural history journals in fostering communities of amateur naturalists, and the development of 'amateur' forms of medicine, from nursing and the first aid movement through to key forms of medical 'inventions' such as prosthetic limbs. Gowan Dawson's book, Show me the Bone: Reconstructing Prehistoric Monsters in Nineteenth-Century Britain and America (2016) illuminates the close relationship between elite and popular contributions to the development of palaeontology. Project research suggests we should rewrite our understandings of the emergence of professional science, and take more account of the role of expert, but non-professional, contributors in the development of science and medicine. Our research is of particular significance at a time when the emergence of large-scale citizen science projects, and patient-practitioner collaborations in medicine, are opening up new ways of thinking and methodologies for both scientific and medical practice. 

Historical research has been matched by contemporary practice. Working with Zooniverse, the world's largest platform for online citizen projects, and in conjunction with the Natural History Museum of London, we developed 'Orchid Observers', an innovative project which combined amateur naturalist work in the field with online analysis of historic herbarium sheets. The preliminary results offer invaluable data on the effects of climate change, as measured by shifting flowering times over three centuries. The research offers a model for new ways of developing museum collections, as well as drawing upon amateur communities for research. 

Another citizen science project with the Zooniverse, Science Gossip, created in collaboration with the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Biodiversity Heritage Library, offers a further model for working with Museums and Heritage collections. It has significantly increased understanding of the role of illustration in natural history, and opened up for further research numerous journals in the area. Both projects demonstrate the enormous potential of working with members of the public in the development of both scientific and historical research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>With the massive development of crowd sourcing and citizen science projects over the last few years our work is ideally placed to help guide future projects in the area. We have developed innovative citizen science projects, as well as demonstrating how humanities researchers can work productively with scientists in a range of areas. On the academic front, our research has brought to the fore the ways in which large numbers of individuals, outside the emerging domain of professional science, were involved in science and medicine, offering models for thinking about the creation of scientific communities, both past and present. 

For Museums and Archives, our work has offered innovative models for opening up the collections, and acting as citizen science hubs. Our citizen science project Orchid Observers is the first to combine active field study with online work on historic herbarium records, and this framework could be developed in a range of museum areas, helping to bring into current scientific use the vast datasets within the manuscript records which are currently largely inaccessible.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>99DF37EE-0FC4-4A85-AB5A-C85B0A8F730D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>British Academy Council - Professor Sally Shuttleworth</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51C125F5-DB64-4C24-BDBA-2FA0B572F9F0</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Served on Expert Group for National Archives Strategy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>857BA58F-3012-4694-BFD1-4796860DE814</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Scientists and Engineers Working In and With Government</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>171CD188-28EB-4F10-A6D7-B45E9828134D</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Royal Society Journal Archive Digitisation Steering Group, Prof Sally Shuttleworth</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3BF20383-9743-49C6-B911-2A5EB9CA7CAC</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>American Astronomical Society Publications Task Force</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4ABCDC1-5513-4205-BFF8-55E90BDCED79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>More open publishing model adopted, and new policy on software publishing accepted.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://journals.aas.org/policy/software.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>POST Note on Environmental Citizen Science</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA53DFD5-0D59-4C57-8907-F292B1788A29</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/POST-PN-476/environmental-citizen-science</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>British Society for the History of Science Council - Prof Sally Shuttleworth</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EA7155ED-41AC-4215-B376-8166CC96DFB2</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bshs.org.uk/about-society/council-and-committees</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>ScienceGossip.org is a Zooniverse project which has been produced in collaboration with the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) and the Constructing Scientific Communities Project.

The metadata created by the citizen scientists relates to the illustrations hidden within the pages of these digitized periodicals - and by identifying the location, author, type of illustration and producing related keywords - the BHL is able to improve their image based search function, and historians are able to correlate masses of information on unknown authors and illustrators from the Victorian period. Since its launch in March 2015, 151,870 pages have been classified by 9126 participants.

The project is located on the Zooniverse platform and has been developed as part of the Constructing Scientific Communities Project. The website combines field photography and biological recording, with online transcription of historical museum herbarium specimens, in order to investigate how the flowering times of 29 UK orchid species are being influenced by climate change. The data gathered also allow UK orchid distribution and population health to be assessed more widely. Addressing scientific challenges such as climate change requires large datasets from multiple field sites. Orchid Observers aims to create modern records from across the UK and to combine these with historical specimen data, building a 180 year time series of orchid flowering time that can be compared against key climate variables. Participants are invited to photograph orchids in flower in their local area and upload their images and field records to the Orchid Observers website. Here, as well as helping to identify the species recorded within each photograph and to classify their flowering stage, participants can also help to extract phenology information from 15,000 historical herbarium specimens spanning three centuries. Since its launch in April 2015, 53,580 classifications of historical herbarium sheets and contemporary field observations have been completed by 1,860 participants. As part of this, 1,805 field images of orchids have been submitted, identified and classified by the online community. Despite being a comparatively well-studied group, at least 200 of these observations represent new UK locations for the orchid species' concerned, which include rare and threatened taxa. 

All field observations (2015 flowering season) have been shared with the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (http://bsbi.org/) for inclusion within their comprehensive database of flowering plant observations from across the UK. Once the complete dataset has been fully verified and analysed for publication, the historical (i.e. herbarium) data and 2015 field observations will be made freely available through the National Biodiversity Network (https://data.nbn.org.uk/) and NHM Data Portal (http://data.nhm.ac.uk/).

Data will be deposited into the Oxford Research Archive at the end of the project.

The project asks citizen historians to tag information from the Medical Officer of Health Reports of London (recently digitised by the Wellcome Library) which were published between 1848 and 1972. Volunteers will highlight issues of health and welfare as they relate to work, food, housing and pollution and sanitation. The result will be a large, robust dataset that will enrich the history of London's health and which will be of interest to social, local and family historians, epidemiologists, and anyone else with an interest in the topic.

Beta testing took place in 2016 and created a very positive response. However, some testers found the site too difficult and work has been undertaken to redesign the site to simplify the tasks. We organised a workshop in February 2017 at the British Academy with leading historians of medicine, representatives from the Wellcome Library and JISC to present research on medical officer of health reports and finalise the format for the redesigned site. 

Data will be deposited into the Oxford Research Archive at the end of the project.
