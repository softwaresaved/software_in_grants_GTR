worldwide effort to increase power generation through solar cells, to meet targets in reducing greenhouse gases. One requirement is for high efficiency multijunction solar cells (MJSCs) to extract power from concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, which are expected to become central to the delivery of solar power to national and super-grid systems. At present such MJSCs must combine different materials systems, and are usually limited by the requirement to lattice-match the individual cells to avoid efficiency losses due to defects. In this proposal we aim to circumvent these problems by investigating solar cells based on InxGa1-xN, which has a direct band gap of 0.7-3.4 eV, spanning most of the visible spectrum, thus promising MJSCs from a single materials system. To avoid the problems of lattice mismatch and of material quality, which limit prototype solar cells based on InxGa1-xN epilayers to low x (x&amp;lt;0.3), we will grow the InxGa1-xN in nanorod form, merging the nanorods using methods we have already developed to provide a solar cell template. The team assembled, which combines complementary expertise in growth and device fabrication (U. Nottingham), structural characterization (U. Bristol), nanoscale optical and electrical characterization (Arizona State U.) and solar cell design and characterization (NREL), aims to explore the properties of InxGa1-xN single junction cells over the full composition range (0</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Concentrated solar power plants (CSPs, up to 1000 suns) have undergone rapid expansion in the last few years, and are expected to become central to the delivery of solar power to national and super-grid systems. A vital component for power extraction is the development of robust, high efficiency multijunction solar cells (MJSCs). The research here aims to establish InxGa1-xN as a viable material to produce efficient MJSCs by solving the problems encountered in high In, or lower bandgap, devices by using nanorod structures. Achieving MJSCs in this single materials system will lead to cost reduction. There is also greater potential for optimum design of MJSCs (with the best combination of band gaps), and for optimum design of the CSPs (as the necessary concentration factor and MJSC cost are linked). Our schedule is designed such that, at the end of the project, we should have sufficient information on growth and cell performance to attract commercial development of InxGa1-xN nanorod-based solar cells. This potentially benefits UK manufacturers of MJSCs, including e.g. Sharp, Quantasol and (potentially) IQE The research programme aims to clarify the fundamental science behind carrier migration along InxGa1-xN nanorods, and how this depends on composition, nanorod dimensions and the presence of defects. Studies by cathodoluminescence, electron holography and time-resolved photoluminescence will give information on the electronic properties, and on the role of electric fields which are lttle known for nanorod structures. This is needed firstly to understand solar cell performance. By revealing these fundamental properties, our research will also benefit the understanding of InxGa1-xN nanorods as potential sensors, and for light emitting applications such as light emitting diodes. By clarifying how defect-free growth can be maintained as the composition changes, and how defects are eliminated, the research will also benefit efforts to grow better quality continuous InxGa1-xN layers for devices, including, for example, light emitting diodes operating at green and longer wavelengths. In total there are planned to be 6 PhD students involved in this project, 4 in the UK of whom only 1 student is funded on the grant, and 2 in the US. By maximising exchange visits, and through the regular grant meetings, these students will benefit from gaining a broad range of research skills, and from active participation in an international research project. The provision of PhDs with such broad cross-disciiplinary skills is important for the future expansion of solar power.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>429592</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hydrogan and Solargan</gtr:description><gtr:id>795A0ECD-134D-4B36-B850-B5DB571E8EEF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Nottingham was involved with me in the earlier grant, growing high In content InGaN by MBE.

Further, under lateral growth conditions, continuous layer is grown on top of nanocolumns/nanorods. The precursor layer and overlayer are doped. Continuous InxGa1-xN layers formed by lateral growth of nanocolumns/nanorods have much lower defect densities than continuous epilayers e.g. 107 to 108 cm-2, as opposed to 109 to 1010 cm-2. The nanorod/nanocolumn devices have several key advantages over devices based on continuous epilayers. The nanorods are perfect single crystals, free of threading defects (less than 108 cm-2), and remain free of defects as they grow laterally until coalescence. The nanorods are compliant structures and have right geometry such that misfit stresses can be eliminated by lateral relaxation, in content to be grown pseudomorphically on GaN base, where composition change is graded. Misfit dislocations and layer stresses which lead to phase separation can thus be avoided. This is not possible with continuous epilayers as there is 7% mismatch between GaN and InN. There is also good evidence that high crystal quality InGaN nanorods can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for all compositions up to pure InN. If threading dislocations are generated e.g. in misfit dislocation source, they are eliminated on nanorod sides; where driving force is relaxation of strain energy. Further, threading defects can be generated in nanorods and are propagated, where they provide top surface growth step. However, for solar cell probability of such defect generation is low (less than 5-10%). Stress relaxation in nanorods also means that composition can be reversed to give InxGa1-xN overlayers with low x. Thus, enables p-type layers (needed in two-junction device) having low x value. This provides crucial flexibility in doping needed to integrate sub-cells into multi-junction device. The solar cell offers advantage of using optimum combination of band gaps for improved overall efficiency, combined with lower epitaxy and processing costs, and without use of toxic materials. The manufacturing is maskless and does not require use of etching chemicals or only in relatively small amounts. InxGa1-xN also has intrinsic properties which are advantageous for solar cells, including high optical absorption of 2x 105 cm-1, giving greater than 90% absorption in 200 nm, compared with greater than or equal to 10 microns for Si, and high carrier mobility and drift velocity which can reduce carrier recombination rates. Moreover, high piezoelectric and spontaneous electric fields present in GaN heterostructures can be used to enhance tunneling through reverse biased junctions. For x greater than 0.43, nanorod/nanocolumn surfaces show electron accumulation, although depth of electron accumulation layer should be 2-3 nm. This suggests that electrons and holes may become spatially separated, and reduce probability of electron-hole recombination</gtr:description><gtr:id>4A8CB3F8-192B-40A1-B329-B0C0758ECFE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The structures envisaged in the patent have been demonstrated</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:patentId>WO2012076901-A1 ; EP2649650-A1 ; US2013269763-A1</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent granted</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Solar cell for forming solar panel, solar concentrator and power plant for producing electricity comprises at least one sub-cell containing several specific indium gallium nitride nanocolumns</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2011</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the research was to grow and characterise InxGa1-xN nanorods and overgrown layers by molecular beam epitaxy for solar cell applications. The work demonstrated that the nanorod structures could be grown defect-free for all compositions x, and graded across the entire composition range without introducing defects. Nanorods of all compositions could be also overgrown with continuous layers as we proposed. However, the research also revealed that the nanorods developed a complex core-shell structure where the core and shell were respectively In-rich and In-poor, and, for some compositions, the core was decomposed into In-rich and In-poor platelets. This led to a new theory of nanorod growth which may be of general applicability to nanorod growth.
