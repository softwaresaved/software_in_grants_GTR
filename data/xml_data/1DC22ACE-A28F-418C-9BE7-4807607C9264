Such microdevices are usually integrated in multifunctional units, which not only offer numerous advantages over traditional large-scale technologies, but also provide a multitude of potential uses in many different research fields that exploit fluids in confined geometries. They have numerous practical applications including drug delivery (e.g. inhalers, microneedles), analytical devices, point of care diagnostics, continuous flow small scale intensified manufacturing, pharmaceutical research, clinical and veterinary diagnostics, etc. In microchannel devices fluids flow in confined geometries and although significant progress has been made, understanding how the different phenomena occurring across a wide range of lengths scales, from molecular-scale processes to macroscopic hydrodynamic ones, and how they are related to each other, is still lacking. More specifically, the proposed research focuses on how microstructures, e.g. membranes, microcontactors, or patterned substrates, affect the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of multiphase flows in microspace; and more importantly how they are influenced by the presence of the microstructure. Such understanding is critical for furthering the applications of microfluidic devices and their utilisation for heat-mass transport enhancement.

The study of microengineered devices in the presence of microstructure posseses many challenges from both a fundamental and applied research point of view. It is our belief that a complete and systematic study of such devices should involve an interdisciplinary approach that requires the use of tools and the development of new methodologies from different areas. This proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive four-year research programme into a novel synergistic approach that will combine state-of-the-art experimental techniques, sophisticated computational fluid dynamics and molecular modeling as well as advanced theoretical physics elements, never attempted before. We aim at rationally understanding, and quantitatively characterising fluid processes in microstructured confined geometries, on both the molecular/thermodynamic and hydrodynamic level, hence establishing connections between phenomena occurring at widely separated scales. As a main case study we shall consider microscale fluid separation which highlights some of the currently unresolved, yet key issues in microengineering technology, namely vapour-liquid equilibrium in confined geometries and breakthrough process (i.e. one phase invading into another). Our main findings will also be used to explore other applications where microstructures play a central role, such as microdistillation, or slip flows and droplet formation. 

The work will be undertaken by a team from the Chemical Engineering Department at Imperial College London with complementary skills and strengths: Kalliadasis (Hydrodynamics/Statistical Mechanics -- Computations, Theory), Galindo (Statistical Mechanics/Molecular Dynamics -- Computations), and Pradas (Statistical/Theoretical Physics -- Computations, Theory); and a team from the Chemical Engineering Department at University College London: Gavriilidis (Experimental Microchemical Engineering and Microfluidics), Kuhn (Microfluidics, Multiphase Flows Modelling and Experiments), and Sorensen (Process Design, Microdistillation).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The economic and societal impact of the proposed research will be realised through the development of modelling and predictive tools for complex fluid processes in microengineered devices (MED). Such systems are key to several rapidly developing technologies in the UK's smart materials, specialty manufacturing sectors and biomedical industries. Future developments in these sectors will require sophisticated mathematical, computational and experimental techniques, as proposed here, which can contribute to many aspects, from improvements in product and design all the way to production.

The research will also lead to the development of state-of-the-art numerical methodologies for the accurate and reliable multiscale simulations of fluid flow in confined microgeometry. These codes will be of benefit to the control and optimisation of industrial processes and devices that exploit microscale flows. 

Finally, the team of Investigators has a strong track record of technology transfer through close collaborations with industry, short courses, workshops and training of high-calibre researchers. The impact plan we have devised is based on a range of routes to maximise the likelihood of success and to reach as wide a community as possible: interactions with industrial partners through other projects, training of the researchers, publication in leading journals, conference presentations, provision of a website and research colloquium.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>507267</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research aims to provide both physical insight in complex fluid flows in confined geometry and the appropriate modelling/predictive tools for such systems.

In terms of applications, these are quite extensive: From small-scale separations, e.g. microdistillation, to lab-on-chip systems, e.g. DNA microarrays. A central problem in microfluidics is also how to control and manipulate fluids at small scales. This is crucial for a variety of applications. For example, an active area of microfluidic applications has recently been the study of
fundamental properties of liquid molecules. Here, controlled microfluidics could offer the possibility to stably confine molecules to very small spaces, or to subject them to controlled forces. In this respect, microfluidics can be used as an engineering tool to extract fundamental knowledge for e.g. biological applications, such as nuclear pore complexes and the transport of particles in the circulatory and respiratory systems.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5576C10B-E57B-435E-83A3-69F4CB36DA5E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Microengineered devices (MED) have recently seen an
explosive growth in a wide spectrum of areas, from microchemical and biological engineering to materials processing and the rapidly growing field of microfluidics, especially lab-on-a-chip systems. Integrated MED offer
numerous advantages over traditional technologies, such as small operating volume, ease of use point-of-care diagnostics, fast reaction of samples and excellent control of the fluids involved. At the same time, advances in microengineering technology have led to the ability to fabricate microstructures, e.g.~membranes/microcontactors and microscale patterned
surfaces. These microstructures can be smartly designed and fabricated to substantially enhance heat and mass transport, create microdroplets of specific size, modify the wetting properties of substrates at will, or manufacture liquid repellent (superhydrophobic or superoleophobic)
surfaces.

Not surprisingly therefore, MED have been an active topic of both fundamental and applied research especially over the last decade. However, despite the several developments and considerable attention they have received, a large
number of key issues and problems remain unresolved and many aspects of fluid processes in MED, especially in the presence of a microstructure, still elude us. In particular, the precise influence of microstructure on the dynamics
and detailed characterisation and quantification of the mechanism for heat or mass transport enhancement. Furthermore, one of the key features of MED is that the interaction between different phases in contact with a solid surface is strongly influenced by the high surface-to-volume ratio achieved as the system is downsized and as a consequence, the microstructure has a big impact on both the molecular (thermodynamic) level and on the macroscopic (hydrodynamic) state of the involved fluids. As far as
molecular-scale phenomena are concerned, they affect strongly the macroscale while the need in macroscopic description is interlinked with the necessity to take into consideration microscopic factors, which come to influence the
fluid motion and transport at incommensurately larger scales. At the same time, the presence of additional complexities in MED, i.e. free-boundaries/interfaces, whose location is not known a priori, makes the corresponding problems inherently nonlinear and hence difficult to analyse. On a practical level, our ability to predict accurately and systematically as well as scale-out rationally complex hydrodynamic processes
in confined geometries, crucial for the design of the corresponding engineering systems, is lacking. The same is true for reference literature and data that design engineers of MED can turn to in order to predict reliably transport coefficients.

The proposed research aims to address these questions through a synergistic approach at the crossroads between applied mathematics, fluid dynamics, microengineering, molecular modelling and theoretical physics, never attempted before in the field.} It will involve a balanced combination
of sophisticated analytical, computational and experimental techniques, a major strength of the research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The impact plan we have developed is based on the identification of several roots to societal-economic impact and impact on peers. 

The following activities offer a means of dissemination of the results obtained in this proposal to fellow academics as well as industrial researchers: (i) Our national and international network of academic contacts; (ii) National and international conferences. These are leading international forums for the exchange of information on all aspects of applied mathematics, fluid flow and thermodynamics-statistical mechanics of fluids; (iii) We have strong records in publication of articles in the leading international journals of high impact factor (hence read by a wide audience) of our respective fields. It is anticipated that the results from this project will be submitted to high-profile international journals devoted to the publication of authoritative articles at the forefront of the topics of the proposed research; (iv) Research seminars in the UK and overseas; (v) Sabbatical and occasional visits by overseas scientists to the UK and visits to overseas institutions. Each Investigator has active international collaborations and regularly visits overseas institutions and receives visitors from abroad. This will aid to the dissemination of the research and increase its impact; (vi) Web-based dissemination, i.e. via the creation of an interactive website with a Wiki architecture that will provide the latest news, access to results, codes and relevant publications. In particular, the resulting numerical codes will be made available on the web as open source. This would also allow for contributions from our peers to the codes' further development. The project will thus contribute to the wider dissemination of our computational tools; (vii) As noted below there are linkages with industry, through other research.

This is fundamental research, however the applications are far reaching and have potential for commercial exploitation. IC has a dedicated commercial exploitation group, Imperial Innovations Ltd (IIL), and consultancy arm while the engineering faculty has a Knowledge Transfer Fellow and Intellectual Property is protected through IIL. There are also links with industry through other research and, therefore, we are ideally placed to disseminate the relevant parts of this research to those who could ultimately use it in applications. These industrial collaborations are vital resources that will be used to facilitate the wider impact of the research and to ensure that results are channelled towards appropriate applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4245A4C7-D96B-4040-8B5F-27EE9FB3E2F7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imperial.ac.uk/complex-multiscale-systems</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a number of novel theoretical and computational methodologies for fluids in confinement ranging from the microscale (using molecular dynamics and density-functional theory) all the way to the macroscopic-continuum scale (using diffuse interface/Cahn-Hilliard models).</gtr:description><gtr:id>B288D36E-F482-4604-AC48-553BB891B4C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Integrated multiscale models for complex fluid flows in confinement do not exist at present.
