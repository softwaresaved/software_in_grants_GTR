Reported declines in pollinators threaten this service and could have serious implications for food security. A key crop dependent on insect pollination is apples, and the contribution of wild pollinators to UK apple production is worth an estimated &amp;pound;95M p.a. However, &amp;quot;pollination gaps&amp;quot; of more &amp;pound;6000/ha have been identified in some varieties, where desired yields and quality are not being achieved due to inadequate pollination. This presents a major opportunity for growers for increased production and profit through better pollination. The documented decline of pollinating insects also poses a significant risk to fruit production by negatively impacting on crop production. In response, top fruit growers have articulated the need to effectively manage pollination services by wild insects in a way that is cost effective in order to maintain production and quality in the face of continued environmental change. 

Our project will develop high quality science to address this need by designing and testing three pollinator management strategies in field scale trials in commercial apple orchards. These include establishing flower rich strips to provide food and shelter for pollinators, providing nesting habitat for ground nesting bees, and adapting the number and placement of 'polleniser' trees in orchards to increase levels of pollination.

Apple trees are predominantly self-incompatible and require pollen from 'polleniser' trees to set fruit, so although they don't produce saleable fruit, pollenisers are planted in orchards. Currently the number of pollinisers planted is based on a rule of thumb of 1 polleniser for every 12 apples trees. As a first step in this project we will trial different numbers and arrangements of polliniser tree in study orchards and measure how this effects pollination and apple production in order to establish an optimum arrangemt and ratio.

Flower strips are known to benefit pollinators. In this project, for the first time, we will design bespoke flower strips specifically aimed at supporting known apple pollinators. We will design our flower strips to contain plants that are particularly good for ground nesting bees and bumblebees which have been identified as top pollinators in apple orchards. Furthermore, we will top our margins (i.e. use a high level cut to remove just the flowers) during apple flowering to push pollinators off the flower strips and onto the apple blossom thus maximising the benefit strips provide. The impact of these targeted flower strips on pollinators and apple production will be measured in field scale trials in commercial orchards.

While the provision of floral resources for pollinators is a well-established approach for increasing pollinator numbers, provision of nesting sites has been widely overlooked and little is known about the effect this can have on pollination service. In this project we will create novel ground nesting bee nest sites in our study orchards and measure the impact these have on bee populations and their contribution to the pollination of apples.

Findings from our field trials will be brought together, and the cost of interventions and the economic return in terms of long-term improvements in quality and production will be established. Our overarching aim is to understand the mechanistic basis of how these three interventions, individually and in combination, effect the value of pollination service contributions to production and profit, so that we can &amp;quot;engineer&amp;quot; the most effective in-orchard interventions. The costs and benefits of these approaches will be assessed to allow specific management recommendations to be made to growers that are practical to implement and provide proven economic returns to growers by supporting long-term stable pollination of apple orchards.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Insect pollination is essential for apple production, improving yield, fruit quality and market value. Pollination deficits in excess of &amp;pound;6,000/ha in UK dessert apple orchards have been identified, so significant economic returns by improving pollination services could be made. Research shows that the majority of apple pollination services are provided by a few species of wild bees. The aim of this project is to design and test three interventions to enhance the effectiveness of wild pollinators of orchards. 

Pollinisers are trees grown in orchards providing a viable pollen source for the commercial trees, but do not contribute to production. Currently the numbers and locations of pollinisers in orchards uses a 'rule of thumb'. The optimum number and spatial distribution of polliniser trees in orchards will be tested in field trial manipulations. 

Floral strips benefit pollinators and enhancing wild bee nesting habitat can locally enhance bee numbers. We will &amp;quot;engineer&amp;quot; the optimal floral composition of flower strips, based on morphology and flowering time, to develop and test flower margins specifically targeted at apple pollinators. In tandem, ground nesting bee habitat will be created to test effects on pollinators and pollination service. Impact of these interventions, individually and in combination, on pollinators and pollination services will be tested in a large scale field trial.

Bio-economic analysis of these interventions will be undertaken utilising a production function method linking management and habitat quality parameters to pollination services as well a portfolio analyses developing spatially explicit management portfolios for growers. Findings will be disseminated through our industrial partners and then to the wider grower community and more broadly through policy benefitting top-fruit production across the UK by promoting cost effective wild pollinator management strategies increasing production quality and stable yields.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this research will be far reaching and findings from the project will directly benefit growers and inform policy decision making with resulting benefits for the consumer and the general public.

GROWERS: 
The value of insect pollination to UK agriculture is estimated to be &amp;pound;691M p.a. (2011) with the value to apples alone at least &amp;pound;95M. The direct involvement and financial support of Avalon and Worldwide Fruit in this IPA project reflects their interest in the outcomes and they have been involved through the proposal development process. Their involvement also provides a direct link for dissemination of findings to the fruit growing industry, ensuring maximum impact in the form of long-term adaptations to orchard management, improving top fruit pollination and food security. The University of Reading, East Malling Research and Centre for Ecology &amp;amp; Hydrology have long-standing relationships with many other grower organisations and supermarkets including Berry Gardens, Sainsbury's, Total Berry, Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board and Waitrose, enabling research findings to have impact beyond project partners. Methods for engaging and influencing the grower community include the use of demonstration orchards, multiple stakeholder workshops, grower factsheets and &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; guides, presentations at tradeshows and publication of materials on industry partner websites. 

POLICY MAKERS: 
Findings from this project will provide evidence to help shape UK policy, particularly in areas of sustainable food production and CAP Countryside Stewardship schemes. Project outputs will be made directly available to government evidence teams through the production of Policy Briefs (e.g. POSTNotes and Policy and Practice Notes) for which the research team has considerable experience. Furthermore, Potts is a member of Defra's Pollinator Expert Advisory Group which is headed by Prof Ian Boyd (Defra's Chief Scientific Advisor), and a member of Defra's Sustainable Innsification Platform Research Advisory Group, thereby ensuring information transfer. He also Chairs the UN Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services assessment of Pollination and Food Production and advises the European Parliament, Commission's DG's and FAO on pollination and food security, thereby giving access to international policy makers. 

GENERAL PUBLIC: 
Pollinators provide essential services underpinning production of high value, nutritious, locally produced products. Evidence from this project will help support sustainable management of pollination services in the UK, ensuring a more stable supply of quality produce which will feedback through the supply chain and potentially benefit consumers. Furthermore, the public has an increasing awareness of the links between pollinators and food production and our work will look to further the public's understanding of the importance of wild pollinators. Our research team has considerable experience presenting research at public events and engaging the public with representation at a number of recent events including LEAF Open Farm Sundays, Cereals, County Agricultural Shows, Oxford festival of nature, Oxford Bio Blitz, and Wildlife Trust family wildlife activity day. The University of Reading, CEH and EMR dedicated press teams will also provide support preparing press releases following major project findings, ensuring they are accurate and distributed to the most relevant and high impact media sources for maximum public exposure and resulting impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>180607</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P001556/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C5107770-461D-42E3-B991-48AE97DF206F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>680500C2-2663-446F-B37A-0D07C1ECE21F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant reproductive biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
