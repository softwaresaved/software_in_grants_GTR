Contemporarily, with the invention of technologies that bring the unseen into visibility, artists have been engaged even more with imaginative representations of abstract scientific data. This project situates itself within this tradition and will make a unique contribution: it will develop a method for describing and reflecting the evolution and transformations of form. It will be guided by the analogy that the process of making is to the finished work of art, as natural selection is to an individuated member of a species. Principles of morphogenesis will be employed to interrogate the generative aspects of form-making.\n\nAbout 100 years ago, the sculptor Gaudier-Breszka carved a modest and playful work of a bird devouring a fish. It captures a decisive moment but also, through the continuity of the material and the carving process, the bird and fish exist in a reciprocal relationship; they morph into one another. Gaudier-Breszka's work refers to the sculptures of diverse cultures where the flux and transformations of nature can become crystallized in a particular object. \n\nAround the same time, the biologist D'Arcy Thompson was compiling his seminal work On Growth and Form, which laid the foundations of morphogenesis, the study of biological dynamics. I am particularly interested in his elaboration of 'co-ordinate networks' which describe morphological change. Today, digital capacities make possible more complex 3-dimensional meshworks and I plan to elaborate on Thompson's earlier 'pencil and paper' diagrams. \n\nThis part of the project will form the basis of a more extended exploration of the development of form using computer languages to simulate evolutionary dynamics. Some of these computations are known as genetic algorithms (GA), and I plan to use them to 'grow' generations of forms, discover rules for selection, and use these new techniques to make work which embodies shape shifting features, including, perhaps, a 21st century bird/fish.\n\nThis project, however, is not just about using clever technology. It will look at more fundamental issues of the creative process. My interest in morphogenesis leads me to make connections between the process of making an artwork and the principles of biological dynamics. The fluidity of either process is difficult to articulate. Features such as randomness appear trivial; trial and error is just too mundane; how do we come to embrace what appears accidental: we struggle to describe the shape of adaptations. \n\nThe use of digital technology allied with its selective embodiment in material provides a method to explore the way such patterns transform anew. The tools I use, including 3D digital modelling, influence my work: they are part of the subject matter and 'the look' of final pieces. The challenge of the project is how an artist responds to the new tools of 'programming languages' in the production of sculptural objects. \n\nThis project is multidisciplinary, calling on the collaboration and expertise of others. Links have been established with the Natural History Museum, the Zoological Museum, Cambridge, and the Cambridge Computer Lab. In addition to practical objectives and outcomes, the project creates a context for synergy and connectivity across disciplines.\n\nDarwin's theory of evolution through natural selection underpins this proposal. \nMy project has a palpable topicality in the light of the current celebrations around his huge influence in science and culture. I will use the opportunity of this timely context to expose the research to a wider audience.\n\nThe Art of Evolution: Darwin, Darwinisms, and Visual Culture (Larson and Brauer, eds) is hot off the press. My project will contribute to these latest intellectual developments through a practice based inquiry of embodied transformations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Commercial/private sector\n\nThrough the established formal links with Alan Blackwell at the Cambridge Computer Lab, there will be contact with several software companies (SolidWorks and AutoDesk) with whom the CCL already have an association. This contact will address user interface issues and extensions of existing software. The research undertaken with programming languages and their relation to existing software applications can produce additional functionality and/or modifications to existing software. \n\nProfessional or practitioner groups\n\nI am a Fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors (RBS). Fellows of the RBS are encouraged to mentor Associate and younger members. Appropriately, the focus is on technical issues. I am one of the few members who employs 3D computer modelling. The RBS has a Seminar programme to which I will contribute by presenting practical aspects of the research project.\n\nThe International Sculpture Conference is an international professional body headquartered in the USA. My invitation to give a paper at the 22nd ISC in London in April 2010 will be an opportunity to reach other sculptors outside the academic framework. I will present the more speculative and in-progress aspects of the research in the context of a forum debate. (There is some overlap with academia here, and the conference in London will be part-hosted by the University of the Arts.)\n\nThe third Sector, Museums\n\nOne of my outcomes is a planned exhibition at the Zoological Museum in Cambridge coinciding with the Cambridge Festival of Ideas in October 2010. Although the Museum is part of the University, it is open to and used by the general public. Co-ordinating my exhibition with the Festival will maximize the exposure of my work to a broader audience and I plan to give a gallery talk addressed to this wider context.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22265</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H033742/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8BB67751-1AD5-4EE8-9104-089D5F236DDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Digital Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
