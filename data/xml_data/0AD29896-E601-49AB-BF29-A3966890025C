It takes as its focus the coinage of Alexander the Great, a unique and utterly transformative phenomenon across an area from the modern Balkans to Afghanistan and India. Coins issued by Alexander and in his name after his death exist today in the millions, scattered in collections across the world. But they are also the victim, as small pieces of precious metal, of wanton destruction and looting in their source countries. The OPAL project will place online a corpus of 5000 coins of Alexander in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the Biblioth&amp;egrave;que nationale de France in Paris. It will do this in such a way as to create a framework of Linked Data resources that will allow their two collections to be virtually united for the first time, and that will create an extensible platform for the eventual incorporation of hundreds of thousands more coins in collections in other countries. As part of this massive, international dissemination it also seeks to contribute data to an existing project based in the United States, and with collaborators in Germany. Having established this platform, the project will also seek both to study the historical and economical impact of the coinage of Alexander and to advertise its existence and, using OPAL as a case-study, to investigate the role of such initiatives and such technology in the preservation of a heritage that transcends the national. To this end a two day conference will be organized with participants from the world of Museums, Libraries and Universities. A particular strength of the OPAL project is that it brings together the cataloguing and Linked Data strengths of a National Library with the research culture of a major University.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78896</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This exhibition, running from 15 Nov 2016 to 23 Apr 2017 showcases the coinage of Alexander the Great. By placing it in its geographical context, the display seeks to demonstrate to an audience (aimed at schoolchildren upwards), using maps and examples of the coinage, how Alexander shaped a common heritage across multiple modern nation states. The display also encourages further engagement with the material by advertising the new web catalogue.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2EF9B393-3E33-411C-B2A1-7472A16CD29A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visitor figures are not yet available, but estimates should be available when the exhibition closes in April.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>The Legacy of Alexander the Great</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ashmolean.org/exhibitions/details/?exh=142</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This award is still in progress, there is thus only a limited amount to report. 

1. An exhibition highlighted in the outputs section. Audience figures are not yet available.

2. The main project conference and associated publication, which we hope will lead to development of best-practice in cultural institutions, has not yet taken place.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DBC58DBA-50AC-4EB7-9E3C-9C9A01CAA0EE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database is the new web database of the of the Heberden Coin Room (HCR) of the Ashmolean Museum.
