It primarily concerns two categories: C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, and it involves interdisciplinary techniques within pure mathematics, drawing particularly on functional analysis, topology, and algebra.

Beyond their quantum mechanical origins, C*-algebra theory gained importance as it was quickly realised that C*-algebras can be constructed to capture key information about other mathematical objects. C*-algebras can be used to encode such things as symmetries, large data sets, networks, and dynamical systems. These constructions follow a common pattern: a mathematical object (such as a group of symmetries) is input and a C*-algebra is output. They suggest an important problem: what do properties of the output C*-algebra tell us about the input mathematical object?

Systematic analysis of this problem reveals that the key is in the classification of C*-algebras. Classification is motivated by the fact that different inputs may produce the same C*-algebra, although it can be difficult to see that they are actually the same. Classification solves this by proving that when C*-algebras agree on certain invariants, they are the same. Here, an invariant is a piece of information associated to a C*-algebra; the invariants used in the classification of C*-algebras are certain ones with many techniques available to compute them.

Recently, the problem of classifying C*-algebras has taken a spectacular turn, in which it has become apparent that certain C*-algebras cannot be classified with the traditional invariants, i.e., these invariants are not sensitive enough. Thorough examinations of why this is the case reveal that the obstructions to classification are related to high topological dimension.

The fact that topological dimension can be considered for C*-algebras is motivated by a classical theorem of Gelfand: that C*-algebras enjoying a special property called commutativity are simply encodings of topological spaces. No information is lost if one studies a space by looking only at this algebra of continuous functions. In particular, dimension of the space can be formulated in terms of properties of this algebra. Using the right formulation, dimension can then be generalised to noncommutative C*-algebras, providing each C*-algebra with a number, its dimension.

The study of C*-algebra dimension has revealed that:
(i) Finite dimension is a robust notion, equivalent to other properties (called regularity properties) for mysterious reasons, which is necessary for classification (and to some extent, sufficient);
(ii) For C*-algebra constructions, the particular value of dimension relates, in some cases, to known numerical invariants, while in others it produces a new interesting property.

These are observations largely at an empirical level (they hold for certain examples or special cases, suggesting that they should hold more generally); the basis of this project is to systematically investigate them, to show that they are true at deeper and more general levels. Point (i) is captured in a major conjecture of Toms and Winter, and we aim to prove this conjecture, and make the reasons less mysterious. For (ii), we aim to deepen our understanding of what C*-algebraic dimension means for C*-algebra constructions, making the relationships between dimension and other invariants more transparent.

Investigations into dimension thus far have opened up a number of new research directions, and this project will also pursue some directions that have potential for major impact.
These will:
- Produce new connections between the modern studies of C*-algebras and topology, and
- Provide new perspectives and inroads into the classification of C*-algebras.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a project of pure mathematical research. Research undertaken will be published first on the arXiv preprint server, and then in high-quality journals. This will make the results accessible and noticed by other mathematical researchers internationally.

Results will be further disseminated through talks at conferences and seminars, given both by myself and the research associate. Conference talks, in which the audience is given a first-hand, big-picture account of the speakers' work, are an absolutely crucial way for pure mathematical research to be communicated and to have an academic impact. I expect to be invited to give a number of such talks during and after the course of this project, given that I currently receive such invitations regularly. Part of the requested funding will cover travel to conferences, especially as certain prestigious institutions (such as MFO and BIRS) provide accommodation but not travel funding to their invited participants.

This project focuses on advancing the theory of C*-algebras. This advance will have specific impact for researchers in the structure of C*-algebras. It will have an impact on our overall understanding of C*-algebras, reaching other areas where C*-algebra theory is applicable, such as operator theory and the quantum mechanical motivation behind C*-algebras. As C*-algebra theory is connected to other areas of mathematics, its impact will be felt through these connections. This is especially true of algebraic topology, representation theory, dynamical systems, and coarse geometry, due to their prominence in objectives (B) and (C).

Training of the research associate is a major and immediate impact of this project. Many employers, especially in industry and finance, seek job applicants with strong analytical skills and experience in theoretical mathematics research. This project provides such research opportunities for the research associate. My Ph.D. student will likewise benefit from the boost in research activity provided by this grant, and this leads to further societal benefits through subsequent employment.

Finally, it should be noted that, as a general trend, the biggest impact of pure mathematical research is not apparent until long after the research has been carried out. Pure mathematicians like myself tend to focus on natural pure problems; historically, some of the biggest impact from pure mathematics has come from surprising and unexpected connections between the pure problems and the real world. The greatest potential impact of this project is of this nature.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98207</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N00874X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
