Equipment</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K031643/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Heriot-Watt University has made significant achievements in supporting its Early Career Researchers (ECRs). In 2010, we were amongst the first UK institutions to have been awarded the European Commission 'HR Excellence in Research' accreditation for our implementation of the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for their Recruitment. More recently in September 2012 we have been shortlisted in two categories of the Times Higher Education (THE) 2012 Awards - 'Outstanding Contribution to Leadership Development' and 'Outstanding Support for Early Career Researchers'.

This recognition has been predominantly through the quality of development activities at institutional level available to ECRs and the creation of opportunities to establish cross-disciplinary networks and connections to enhance their research capacity and impact. These always complement School-level initiatives which support ECRs including for example access to dedicated funds for travel and conference/training event attendance, access to Scholarships to assist new lecturers find their first research students.

KitBoost will take these initiatives further by establishing a boost to the start-up facilities that ECRs require in establishing their research careers. The areas of research to supported are varied and include the National Capabilities Themes of Catalysis, Quantum optics, Water Engineering, Microsystems and many others. Cutting across these most of the research programmes also contribute to Challenge Themes, especially 'Manufacturing the Future', 'Energy', 'Digital Economy' and 'Healthcasre Technologies'.

In preparing the proposal, we encouraged as many Early Career Researchers working in areas within EPSRC's remit as possible to explicitly identify specific items of equipment (under &amp;pound;10,000 including VAT) that would make a valuable contribution to their research programmes. We identified nearly 40 academic ECRs in working in research groups with many associated EPSRC-fundedResearch Associates research students. These in turn identified over 30 research programmes that the additional of a number of items of small equipment items would enable them to overcome current limitations; a list of over 120 separate equipment items and with repetitions this amounted to nearly 250 individual pieces. Within the requested budget of &amp;pound;625,000 (fEC) we would be able to fund just over half of these. We note EPSRC are potentially willing to extend the overall budget for the call after for and therefore have prioritised the list and individuals so that we could respond to funding at a the requested level very rapidly but could also respond positively and quickly to funding at a higher level without detriment to the timescale of delivery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The HWU EPSRC Research Award Portfolio (currently &amp;pound;61M from Grants on the Web) places us in the top 20 HEIs in the UK, covering a wide range of engineering, physical sciences, mathematical sciences, and information technologies with global social and economic relevance. Our portfolio of research aligns well with EPSRC Priority Areas &amp;amp; Themes and RCUK Grand Challenges, research that is recognised to be of national importance. These areas are also recognised by Scottish Enterprise and the Technology Strategy Board as key to Scottish and UK economic growth. The size and nature of our EPSRC portfolio and the dynamics of working with enterprises to solve relevant issues and problems suggests that the scope of our impacts will be wide.

The areas below are those which have both been identified as of strategic importance to Heriot-Watt University and identified as research programmes targeted for support through KitBoost:
* Sensors and Photonics
* Advanced Manufacturing
* Physical Sciences / Healthcare Interface
* Water Resources
* Interactive and Intelligent Systems
* Parallel Systems
* Solar Energy
* Marine Renewables
* Carbon Capture Technologies

ECRs working in these areas identified companies working in the following sectors as potential beneficiaries Green Chemistry, Energy (depletion of oil supplies), Carbon Capture, Manufacturing, as well as specific named organisations such as Unilever, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Siemens, Honeywell, Scottish and Southern Energy, Baker Hughes, and FMC technologies.

ECRs will be able to take advantage of the following in creating impact from their work supported by KitBoost
* The University's Impact Acceleration Account
* The University's successful Converge business development and knowledge exchange initiative
* The Edinburgh Beltane Beacon for Public Engagement
* Training and Development in Knowledge Transfer and Impact</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>500000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cell-by-cell</gtr:description><gtr:id>D8346324-4BD4-4776-8BFF-10A8753C3731</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Glasgow (Dr Ameet Pinto - microbial in water), University of Strathclye (Dr James Windmill - ultrosonics)</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Multi-Phase Flow Research Theme contribution to EPSRC Award (EP/L026511/1): Cell-by-cell: On Demand Assembly and Control of Microbial Communities for the Water Industry (commence May 2014).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Catalysts characterisation</gtr:description><gtr:id>17898D18-C25B-447C-99CA-597E74EFF08E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None accepted or awarded yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Kelvin Nanocharacterisation Centre (Physics) contribute expertise in characterising our catalysts using a state-of-the-art STEM microscope.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Materials Chemistry focus on the design of nanomaterials for biomedicines, catalysis and the environment.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of St Andrews</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Generation of triplet photon states</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E12B7E1-3DAF-49D0-9386-D39CFAF3A951</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaboration between theory and experimental groups in the area of quantum coherence in biological systems</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration between theory and experimental groups in the area of quantum coherence in biological systems</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Strathclyde</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cell-by-cell</gtr:description><gtr:id>51461CA3-E92C-4C5E-8BCD-B14E2DB25C7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Glasgow (Dr Ameet Pinto - microbial in water), University of Strathclye (Dr James Windmill - ultrosonics)</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Multi-Phase Flow Research Theme contribution to EPSRC Award (EP/L026511/1): Cell-by-cell: On Demand Assembly and Control of Microbial Communities for the Water Industry (commence May 2014).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>20162</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Standard</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/L026511/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6810FFE9-3FCE-4B6E-BC51-EAD32B64FC06</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This award provided small pieces (under &amp;pound;10k) for over 50 ECRs across the University (hence a project-specific email not possible), a selection of developments follows:

A: The CPS devices and the underlying framework (UBilts) provide a variety of ways in configuring body-area networks. Thus it can be easily integrated to/for any domains and application front ends and made pervasive. Safety critical activities can be monitored in a real environment rather than soley lab-based. Particulalry, CPS technologies is new to the construction industry, enabling them to reduce the time and costs of saftey training while at the same time conducting human factors research at operational level (i.e., on site). 

B: Better understanding of thermal spray splat morphologies will improve bonding characteristics of thin film coatings. This leads to thinner more uniform coat and better coating properties.

C: The research findings suggest that an environmentally friendly system for reducing CO2 emission is possible using enzymes and synthetic catalysts. This has direct impact on energy, the environment and chemicals sector. Further the products from these CO2 processing can become building blocks for pharmaceutical products. Finally, the new knowledge generated can benefit the education sector.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>67CC05DE-8385-4EF3-9A03-6B5B3670D03B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This award provided small pieces (under &amp;pound;10k) for over 50 ECRs across the University (hence a project-specific email not possible), a selection of developments follows:

A: A new method to connect physics based modelling with cypber-physical system (CPS) in a low cost manner has been achieved.

B: New knowledge generated in understanding: 1. Crystalisation kinetics (improvement on existing methods) 2. High velocity impact of thermal spray splat morphology (new bonding number derived to characterise bonding of sprays) 3. New research network and collaboration (EPSRC Cell-by-cell Sponsorship Award) to build microbial community for safe drinking water 4. Increase research capability to delivery specialist CPU-GPU HPC training on numerical skills to research students to pioneer the use of meshless methods in modelling ferro-magnetic fluids 

C: The equipment (spectrometer + CCD camera) has allowed us to expand the remit of our research interests. This equipment was initially acquired to support a collaboration between theory and experimental groups in the area of quantum coherence in biological systems (e.g. photo-synthesis). A grant application was also submitted to EPSRC but was not funded. However, the collaboration is still proceeding, now on different topic, i.e. generation of triplet photon states. The equipment has also been used to perform studies on artificial black holes created in the lab using lasers. A number of routes have been explored, many of them promising but not good enough to reproduce all of the physics we are looking for. This has therefore allowed us to home-in and fine tune our system and we are steadily perfecting our artificial black holes to the point that we believe that soon we will have excellent results.

D: The Parr Reactor and GC have been used for a CO2 conversion project. So far we have developed a new catalytic system combining bio- and heterogeneous(synthetic) catalysts for CO2 conversion to methanol.

E: The equipment has been used in a quantum optics lab. The equipment was invaluable for the collection of the data for two publications. 

F: A novel optical geometry as an improved research method was developed and significant new knowledge on measurement of stochastic optical fields was generated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This award provided small pieces (under &amp;pound;10k) for over 50 ECRs across the University (hence a project-specific email not possible), a selection of potential future developments follows:

A: The UBilts framework has recently been used to develop brain-controlled interfaces (BCI) and serious games. The current CPS technology coupled with physics-based human dynamic modelling will be taken forwards in human factors research in an upcoming KTP project in the domain of Oil and Gas.

B: Findings from the use of microbial community for safe drinking water will be valuable to the water industry. Considerable interest from Scottish Water as well as water companies from the Netherlands to build on this novel idea to create sustainable economy for safe drinking water.
The equipment was valuable in assisting the following developments to take the research further: a) EPSRC Cell-by-cell Sponsorship Award (commence May 2014) Universities of of Glasgow (Pinto - microbial in water), and Strathclye (Windmill - ultrosonics) b) Surface tension dominated flows (commence March 2014) University of West of Scotland (Fu - thin film coating and surface acoustics waves).

C: We have identified and demonstrated two new techniques for measuring fluid dynamics in intense light beams. One of these is based on a similar method used in oceanography and for the first time we have applied this to light. The second method allows to directly measure the spectral content of wave turbulence in an optical beam. We expect both methods to be of interest for the research community and will allow more precise and detailed measurements in the growing field of quantum fluids.
The equipment has help in collaborations developing with 1 - Lovett (St Andrews), Picozzi (Dijon University) and Trillo (Universita' dell'Aquila).

D: For academic route, the new system developed can be adapted by other chemical synthesis methods, in particular those involving an enzyme requiring regeneration. For industries, the potential savings from our new systems can represent new manufacturing routes for fine chemicals. A new concept of low energy CO2 utilisation can also be taken further by the energy sector for large scale development.
A new collaboration with the Kelvin Nanocharacterisation Centre (Physics) at the University of Glasgow has been established.
