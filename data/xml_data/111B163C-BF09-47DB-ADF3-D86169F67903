Africa's groundwater systems are a critical but poorly understood socio-ecological system. Explosive urban growth, irrigated agricultural expansion, industrial pollution, untapped mineral wealth, rural neglect and environmental risks often converge to increase the complexity and urgency of governance challenges across Africa's groundwater systems. These Africa-wide opportunities and trade-offs are reflected in Kenya where the government's unifying Vision 2030 aims to double the irrigated agricultural area whilst simultaneously promoting the growth of high-value mineral resources. Institutional capacity to govern interactions between economic activities, water resource demands and poverty outcomes are currently constrained by insufficient knowledge and lack of effective management tools. The overarching project aim is to design, test and transfer a novel, interdisciplinary and replicable Groundwater Risk Management tool to improve governance transformations to balance economic growth, groundwater sustainability and human development trade-offs.

The project will make four major contributions to support interdisciplinary science and governance of managing groundwater risks for growth and development in Africa:
a) An automated, daily monitoring network for shallow groundwater levels - the first system of its kind in the world and replicable at scale.
b) A new Groundwater Risk Management Tool which is transferable and sustainable in Africa.
c) New epidemiological insights into the health impacts of faulty or intermittent water supplies.
d) Improved theory and evidence of groundwater governance and poverty pathways.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Intended beneficiaries encompass stakeholders from government, enterprise, communities, particularly the poor, women and girls, and the international research and practitioner communities.
a) Kenya
i) Vulnerable rural water users - in the study area there are at least 60,000 rural water users served by the handpump maintenance project (ESRC). The project has three staff including two mechanics who liaise with the communities on a daily and positive basis. Given County Government support at the Ministerial level (Dr Chiguzo) we anticipate and have discussed uptake to all County handpumps (c.600-800) which would at a minimum double the total beneficiaries. 

ii) Local water governance - the Water Resources User Association is a key beneficiary institution with linkages to all other WRUAs in Kenya. The project has established working relationships with District Officers (overall, water, health), chiefs, elders, school head teachers, Msambweni hospital and clinics. All are highly supportive of the project including the new County Governor who mentioned the project in his first anniversary address.

iii) Government - the Water Resource Management Authority (WRMA) has indicated the significance, support and scalability of the project in its letter of support. The Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB, responsible for rural and urban water services) works with Oxford/RFL in existing grants and will continue to translate results into national policy. Ministry of Water and Irrigation are also informed of the work. Prof Olago was former President of the Kenyan Geological Society and remains an active member.

iv) Enterprise - Base Titanium Ltd. and KISCOL have indicated their support through data sharing and collaboration. A major project workshop in Nairobi in Year two will convene major enterprises reliant on groundwater from oil and gas, mining and irrigation sectors.

iv) National and International research institutes - led by JKUAT and University of Nairobi the research will benefit the national research community in events and networking through their respective centres, WARREC and ICCA. Further, the team has established and deep relationships with the UN (UNICEF, UNDP), water-focused donors (SIDA, GIZ, DGIS) and the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank.

b) International
i) Oxford and UPC will mobilise global science and policy networks through senior staff (Edmunds, Bradley, Hope, Custodio, Carrera). These include IAH, UNESCO-GWADI, UNICEF-WASHnet (global), RWSN, World Bank-WSP, UKGS, etc.
 
ii) UPGro Knowledge Broker activities, outreach and events will be developed and build on established relationships with RWSN through Hope, which currently includes webinars, D-groups and events linked to his research group.

iii) Enterprise partnerships and collaboration will build on Dr Hope's role in the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. He co-leads the Sharing Resource Prosperity programme with Dr McElroy which has a global extractive industry network, including the International Congress of Mining and Minerals led by Ross Hamilton. This work links to DFID's Africa Extractives Adviser, Grundel Holger, who is aware of the Kwale research following a meeting with Dr Hope in February 2014. More widely, Dr Hope is actively engaged with Diageo, SABMiller and the Coca Cola company, who have major African operations relying on groundwater use.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1751444</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>WWF Water Stakeholders Platform - 14th &amp; 15th Nov, 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4242D70F-4E75-4640-BFB5-10888E16D79B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Gro for GooD project participated in WWF Water Stakeholders Platform - 14th &amp;amp; 15th Nov, 2016, which brought together 8 local stakeholder organisations.

Key findings to date include:

1. 3 sets of panel data of over 3,000 households are revealing welfare transitions in the county over the period 2014 to 2016. Analysis of 2014-2015 data showed that urban, coastal area are experiencing a sharp dip in welfare whilst there have been increases in welfare north of the mine and sugarcane sites. A paper on this work is in the pipeline.

2. The Groundwater Risk Monitoring Strategy has been progressed via interdisciplinary work blending climate, surface water, groundwater, welfare and health data streams. Local and national partners continue to participate in monitoring activities and plans for the eventual transfer of monitoring to local institutions are underway.

3. Positive responses during collaborative design of the Groundwater Risk Management Tool by local and national partners underline the need for a sustainable financing mechanism for the long term adoption of the tool. The project will support the demand for the research and track the institutional process of the collaborative design over time. Recent stakeholder meetings are clarifying ways in which outputs of the tool could be communicated to different audiences.

4. Aquifer depth monitoring techniques are being advanced as is documented in a recent paper (Colchester et al, 2017).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Too early to say.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A33DDB5B-34D9-4E40-B23E-DFFF0AAF4D0C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research-programmes/water-programme/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/50DE4B7D-C516-42E2-8C92-13A699322F6C"><gtr:id>50DE4B7D-C516-42E2-8C92-13A699322F6C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Insuring against Rural Water Risk - Evidence from Kwale, Kenya</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e13ab437a39cd8102110bbf88fc58ee2"><gtr:id>e13ab437a39cd8102110bbf88fc58ee2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Foster, T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D365B598-5F05-4863-908A-31584771CD80"><gtr:id>D365B598-5F05-4863-908A-31584771CD80</gtr:id><gtr:title>Accidental infrastructure for groundwater monitoring in Africa</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4c36046beb8b1fb0ba294f3a69457e8e"><gtr:id>4c36046beb8b1fb0ba294f3a69457e8e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Colchester F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/96903DB4-03C1-4466-A32A-388CA2C09FF1"><gtr:id>96903DB4-03C1-4466-A32A-388CA2C09FF1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Implementing the right to water - water policy choices with decentralised politics in Kenya</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/93d02f4eddb843a617b7eb47695a0c73"><gtr:id>93d02f4eddb843a617b7eb47695a0c73</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Koehler, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/872550DC-FE3B-4437-A80C-3D4E09A97994"><gtr:id>872550DC-FE3B-4437-A80C-3D4E09A97994</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evaluating waterpoint sustainability and access implications of revenue collection approaches in rural Kenya</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Water Resources Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8970328320af04cf0be0114b44c256c4"><gtr:id>8970328320af04cf0be0114b44c256c4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Foster T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/M008894/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D4B9AE9-278F-4867-8D5E-31631698729E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EDE0586F-810A-4956-BC26-74CA0D6759F6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hydrogeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D5E20EB-F470-4A70-9B72-5D68D7AFB1EB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Nat Resources, Env &amp; Rural Dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
