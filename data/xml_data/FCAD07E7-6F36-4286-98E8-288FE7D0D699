Storing the cell pellets and purifying as required proved to be successful. The cell pellets could be stored at -80 ?C and used for a maximum of 5 weeks.

The stability study on ZZ-GFP-Bfr and Bfr-Au nanocage placed the maximum storage at 4 weeks at -20 ?C. The ob-served fragmentation was likely to occur from chemical deg-radation32 enabled by the tertiary structure of the folded pro-tein. Thus further work is required to engineer a more stable form of the protein and work out exactly how ZZ-GFP-Bfr is fragmenting.

Citrate stabilized nanoparticles appeared to dissociate less rapidly than the original nanoparticles. However as only one study was conducted further work is needed to confirm this observation.

The gold binding domain in this construct was added to prevent the spontaneous formation of Bfr-Au nanocage and drive the equilibrium towards Bfr-Au nanocage once gold nanoparticles were added. Whilst the studies in this re-search have proved this has not been successful in driving the equilibrium towards the 24-mer form, the observations have been supported by literature. A possible solution to this problem could be through adding CaCl2 to the mix. As well as probing other constructs.

Polydispersity was also observed during ZZ-GFP-Bfr puri-fication on the FPLC, due to multimers, commonly found in literature7. There was also some evidence of spontaneous nanocage formation without the presence of gold. In future work native PAGE will be used alongside these other tech-niques to monitor the polydispersity of solutions.

No endpoint was reached when studying Bfr-Au nanocage formation. Hence the amount of gold added was the limiting factor. Whilst there was a limit to this experiment, in future work nanoparticle sizing will be used to track formation on a smaller scale.

When studying the amount of gold added, a maximum was achieved under stoichiometric conditions and this will be used in future experimentation.

Due to the high salt concentration and increased amount of gold for stoichiometric addition aggregation occurred. A microplate study on aggregation during Bfr-Au nanocage formation using citrate nanoparticles showed aggregation in both a low and high salt buffer. Thus the gold nanoparti-cles used in this experimentation need to be studied further. A separate look into ways to combat the aggregation of the gold nanoparticles would be invaluable. This could be through changing the buffers used or perhaps using differ-ently stabilised nanoparticles.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work has provided an interesting insight into a new protein construct ZZ-GFP-Bfr. Many of the observations have directly correlated to literature and helped further build the complex picture of engineered protein nanocages. Whilst much is to be done before ZZ-GFP-Bfr is suitable for use in single molecule detection experiments, this construct has enabled further study into the intricate nanocage for-mation process with bacterioferritin. Supporting much pre-vious work on native ferritin and native/engineered bacteri-oferritin. The possibility of chemical degradation causing the fragmentation of the construct is a valuable find and with more study could enable further understanding of pro-tein chemical degradation. This work has also sufficed to highlight some of the problems associated with gold nano-particle aggregation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>132FB11B-F1B8-4CB8-8BC7-7E4D7C2030EF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>As part of this grant new sensing strategies were developed which can be used for confirming stability of proteins</gtr:description><gtr:id>D119D660-73DF-4727-84E3-FD446BC1B746</gtr:id><gtr:impact>patent application submitted and high impact paper published.
