This means that employment protection legislation typically covers all those who provide their work under a contract of employment. Typically, this goes to the exclusion of those who provide their work under a contract for services, also know as 'self-employed' persons. This approach has been criticised by many (Freedland 2003, Deakin and Wilkinson 2005, Countouris 2007) as artificial and ineffective in adequately protecting a number of vulnerable workers that, due to a number of reasons, fall outside the notion of 'employee' working under a contract of employment.\n\nThe present work seeks to address this growing inadequacy of labour law systems, by studying systematically the formation, structure, terms expressed and implied, and termination of 'personal work contracts' (PWC), a newly coined term that includes and is broader than the existing legal notion of 'contract of employment'. The concept of PWC seeks to consolidate and expand the successful notion of 'personal employment contract' introduced by Mark Freedland in his seminal work of 2003, and to do so in a comparative and European context.\n\nOur research seeks to establish a framework of principles (1) locating personal work contracts within the compass of personal work relationships, (2) specifying the nature of the parties to those contracts, and dealing with multilateral work relationships, (3) identifying more clearly than it has hitherto been the relationship between the optional norms of personal work contract and the mandatory norms of legislation and, where applicable, collective bargaining dealing with the rights and duties of workers, (4) clarifying the public law dimension of this primarily private law topic.\n\nAnother central aim of the book is to introduce and investigate the relevance of the 'personal work nexus' (PWN). Perhaps the best way to describe the relevance of the notion of 'nexus' for the purposes of our research is to quote from Elias, J in James v Greenwich [2006]: 'The issue in agency cases is ... whether there are sufficient legal obligations to create a contractual nexus' between the worker and user company. Our research seeks to identify a series of contractual but also - we believe - non-contractual nexuses that could and should be found in a number of 'problematic' personal work relationships as to reconduct them within the scope of application of employment law.\n\nIn particular we will focus on (1) the personal work relation of civil servants, (2) the PWN applying to some particularly problematic 'autonomous' work relations, such as those involving individual entrepreneurs, commercial agents and professional workers, and (3) on the PWN existing in the context of 'precarious' work relations (including volunteers and trainees). Our conclusions will suggest that the scope of application of employment law ought to be informed by the principles of 'dignity', 'capacity' and 'reliance', and increasingly shaped by reference to the notion of 'personal work nexus'.\n\nThe work seeks to achieve its goals by means of a critical distillation of legal principles from case-law and statute law, supported by an apparatus of analytical, contextual and comparative scholarship. In particular we will elaborate on the concepts of multi-layered regulation and reflexive regulation to analyse the changing notions of personal work relationships in English and European law.\n\nThe questions that the book seeks to address are at the centre of contemporary employment law and employment policy debates, both at a national (James v Greenwich 2008, Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill) and an international level (EC Commission GP (COM/2007/0627) ILO R-198 of 2006). The book seeks to make a significant analytical and normative contribution to what is clearly a topical and dynamic area of legal scholarship.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17429</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4E63866F-932F-4EA7-83BC-35C4D7D2C422"><gtr:id>4E63866F-932F-4EA7-83BC-35C4D7D2C422</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Legal Construction of Personal Work Relations</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/66d87854831d9451c64602c83921e492"><gtr:id>66d87854831d9451c64602c83921e492</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Freedland FBA Mark</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199551750</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G006407/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>05111DBD-D3AB-4CEB-B45C-DD5885F4C460</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
