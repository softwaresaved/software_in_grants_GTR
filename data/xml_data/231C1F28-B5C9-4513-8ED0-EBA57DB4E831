In eukaryotes, the process of faithfully transcribing DNA into RNA is carried out by three distinct transcription machineries, RNA polymerase I, II and III. Each RNA polymerase is responsible for the transcription of a specific subset of genes. RNA polymerase III is the enzyme devoted to the transcription of short essential RNAs which are involved in fundamental cellular functions, such as the tRNAs and the 5S rRNA. To efficiently transcribe the eukaryotic genome, RNA Polymerase I, II and III rely on distinct sets of transcription factors, which selectively recognise a specific class of genes and accordingly recruit the cognate RNA polymerase. 

During the last twenty years, the eukaryotic transcription machineries have been extensively characterised: a detailed map of RNA polymerase II structure and the overall architecture of RNA polymerase I and III have been obtained. This structural information has been instrumental in understanding the function and the mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription machineries. Nevertheless, a very scarce amount of structural information is available regarding the mechanisms by which class-specific transcription factors recruit and assist their cognate RNA polymerase to form a transcriptionally competent pre-initiation complex. As a consequence, the process of transcription initiation remains obscure and, for this reason, we are aiming to obtain structural and functional information of Pol III pre-initiation complexes using an integrated structural biology approach. 

We are focussing on the Pol III system, since Pol III core pre-initiation complexes are particularly stable. Specific transcription factors required for the correct assembly of a pre-initiation complex are stably associated subunits of the Pol III enzyme, whereas in the Pol II system the analogous transcription factors are dissociable. To this end, we were able to isolate and purify crystallization-grade Pol III core pre-initiation complexes, using endogenous yeast RNA Polymerase III and transcription factors produced recombinantly. To study the structures of these large macromolecular complexes, we are integrating cryo-EM and crystallography, an approach that recently enabled us to structurally and functionally characterize the Pol III core enzyme. 

The structural information will be critical in order to understand the underlying mechanisms which govern the assembly of functional eukaryotic pre-initiation complexes which are able to accurately initiate transcription. As transcription initiation is a highly regulated process, our findings will have a profound impact on the field of gene expression regulation. Additionally, since the assembly of Pol III initiation complexes is a process often deregulated in cancer cells, our findings will provide an opportunity to develop and test new anti-cancer therapies based on normalization of Pol III transcription levels. Furthermore, Pol III products have been shown to act as essential effectors of the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway to control cellular and organismal growth, hence the output of the proposed research can impact other important biological processes controlled by TOR, such as stress response and aging.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>To achieve faithful transcription, RNA polymerase (Pol) I, II and III rely on different sets of transcription factors, assembling into specific pre-initiation complexes (PICs) on cognate gene promoters. 

However, recent findings suggested a conserved architecture for the core of the three eukaryotic PICs. In particular, eukaryotic core PICs contain the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a TFIIB or TFIIB-like factor and TFIIF- and TFIIE-related factors. In contrast to the Pol I and II systems which require also additional factors in order to drive efficient transcription, Pol III only requires the transcription factor TFIIIB, which comprises Brf1, TBP and Bdp1. Given the overall conservation of eukaryotic core PICs, the Pol III-PIC represents a minimal initiation-competent core complex, whose structural and functional determinants are likely to be conserved also in Pol I and II.

Recently, we have been able to reconstitute and biochemically characterise a Pol III-PIC, composed of an intact 17-subunit endogenous yeast Pol III enzyme, a recombinant TFIIIB complex and an endogenous TATA-box containing segment, grafted from the yeast U6 promoter. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms which govern transcription initiation, a fundamental but still obscure step of the transcriptional cycle, we are now planning to investigate the architecture of a core Pol III-PIC by combining x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. The combination of these two highly complementary approaches will allow us to obtain a detailed snapshot of a Pol III-PIC at molecular level, unravelling the molecular basis of PIC assembly in eukaryotes. 

We have also the ambitious goal to biochemically and structurally characterize larger Pol III initiation complexes containing additional class-specific transcription factors, such as Bdp1, and regulators, such as Maf1 and the kinase CK2, thus recapitulating a complete transcriptionally-active initiation complex.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project will impact a large group of academics, but the output of the research will also impact the general audience: unravelling the molecular details of the process of transcription initiation will in general enhance our understanding of a central and essential cellular process, such as RNA transcription. In the long term, those mechanisms will be the basis for the development of models to qualitatively and quantitatively predict genes regulation in basal conditons and/or in response to environmental and cellular stimuli. 

Pol III genes are also emerging as specialized loci which are very central for shaping and organizing the genome in the nucleus. The proposed project will contribute also in this respect, representing a first essential snapshot of those interspersed nuclear molecular hubs and galvanizing the community engaged in the study of genome spatial organization, certainly one of the most relevant but largely unknown biological questions.

The combination of techniques used to achieve the major objectives of the project will result in highly-trained scientists, who will have a broad range of expertise at the end of the project. 

Furthermore, the research proposal has the potential to be translated into a tangible benefit for cancer patients. Structural information on the intricate network of interactions occurring during the assembly of initiation complexes will be instrumental to develop and test inhibitors which will block specifically initiation of Pol III transcription, restoring normal levels of Pol III transcripts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>502777</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have elucidated how Brf2, a specific transcription factor, acts as a master switch of metabolic (oxidative) stress and how this layer of regulation is hijacked in cancer cells.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Investigating targeting Brf2 as a novel anticancer therapy</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EA1570BA-17CE-43B4-A674-EACD586689E7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/599DDAA6-C28E-4D70-BFB3-DFD7BF84062B"><gtr:id>599DDAA6-C28E-4D70-BFB3-DFD7BF84062B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Redox Signaling by the RNA Polymerase III TFIIB-Related Factor Brf2.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/765980f2f67271dcce7d2e978e74ca93"><gtr:id>765980f2f67271dcce7d2e978e74ca93</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gouge J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0092-8674</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/K014390/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6FACFC06-C057-4BBC-8936-6881298CB318</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ageing: chemistry/biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D16FDB98-8CBA-4298-8ACD-955DF734E7F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cells</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CC10CC12-1D16-48BD-8F66-6A64A651DEAB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gene action &amp; regulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1163A5D2-CE35-4C7E-904E-6FB2B5FA0C2A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Multiprotein complexes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F14C04A0-571D-4298-AEAC-AEC5A0A9DB7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Structural Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
