Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques are a necessary tool to guarantee that a component is free of any harmful damage. Thermosonics (also known as ultrasonic stimulated thermography) is an NDE technique that uses an infrared camera to image material defects by detecting the frictional heating at crack surfaces when a part under inspection is vibrated. These vibrations are produced by a high-power ultrasonic horn being pressed against the surface of the component under investigation. Thermosonics has the advantages of being rapid, affordable and more sensitive to micro-cracks detection than traditional infrared thermography. However, the ultrasonic horn used in thermosonics is a crude means of exciting vibrations. The mechanical contact between the material and the horn typically results in an uncontrolled generation of vibrations, which makes thermosonics results non-reproducible and, therefore, this technique not reliable.

NUSIT proposes a reliable and reproducible alternative to thermosonics by developing a novel hybrid NDE inspection method, here named as nonlinear vibro-thermography, obtained by a combination of nonlinear ultrasonic techniques and thermography. Nonlinear ultrasonic methods measure the material nonlinear effects caused by the interaction of ultrasonic waves with the &amp;quot;clapping&amp;quot; motion or the frictional contact between micro-crack surfaces. As a result of this interaction, other frequency components of the single input frequency can be generated. These new frequencies indicate that a damage is present within the material. Nonlinear ultrasonic methods will provide in NUSIT a reliable means to select the input frequency that will enhance these material nonlinear effects. This will allow high sensitivity to micro-cracks detection and repeatability. Traditional thermography will be then used to image the frictional heating at the damage location. The input frequency selection process will also be optimised in NUSIT by analysing the concept of nonlinear local defect resonance for input power reduction. 

This eighteen-month project will be mainly focused on assessing real-life material damage such as corrosion micro-cracks in metallic structures and impact flaws in composite materials. To accomplish these objectives, NUSIT is supported by the Nuclear National Laboratory and Rolls-Royce that are providing a set of steel nuclear storage canisters with corrosion micro-cracks and impact damaged composite aero-engine components as in-kind contribution. Nonlinear vibro-thermography will produce a step-change in the non-destructive inspection of both metallic and composite materials by ensuring rapid and affordable inspection of large areas and complex geometries, reliable excitation and high sensitivity to the presence of micro-structural flaws. The overall aim of NUSIT will be to take nonlinear vibro-thermography out of the laboratory and introduce it successfully into industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The successful implementation of nonlinear vibro-thermography as a novel non-destructive evaluation (NDE) inspection system will ensure significant reduction in maintenance time and costs as well as the increase of safety due to the high sensitivity and reliability in detecting material defects for aeronautic, nuclear and high value manufacturing industries. The UK has 17% of the global aerospace market share with revenue of &amp;pound;24 billion and is responsible for 3.6% national employment. With the international civil aerospace market forecast to grow to $4 trillion by 2030, the UK market has the opportunity to grow to $352 billion by 2030. The civil nuclear industry also plays a pivotal role in the UK economy as it employs around 85,000 people of which 45,000 work at power plants and 40,000 in the supply chain. In addition, as noted by EPSRC, the development of novel material inspection techniques has been identified as a national priority area by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills. NDE techniques play a significant role in High Value Manufacturing as highlighted by Innovate UK. The UK is world-leading in NDE development having 24 of the 183 key NDE companies, with a global turnover in 2012 of about &amp;pound;5.6bn. 

Industrial: Rolls-Royce and the Nuclear National Laboratory will benefit directly from the outcome of NUSIT. Indeed, by improving the efficiency of aircraft maintenance operation, extending the damage tolerance boundaries of aircraft components and reducing the materials usage, NUSIT will contribute to decrease CO2 emissions for commercial aircraft by 50% per passenger-kilometre. Such a reduction should enable a lighter, more fuel efficient next generation of aircraft in the next 5-20 years. This project will also contribute to reduce the operations and maintenance costs for nuclear power plants, which are usually realised during planned maintenance and refuelling outage periods and account for nearly 91% of planned energy loss. A technology live donstrator will be built in collaboration with the Nuclear National Laboratory and Rolls-Royce towards the end of the project to showcase the proposed nonlinear vibro-thermography system. Input from both Rolls-Royce and the Nuclear National Laboratory will be available throughout the project via quarterly meetings with senior NDE specialised personnel. Ciampa will work with the University of Bath's Research Innovation Services, to conduct a review of Intellectual Property (IPs) developed in this project and, if applicable, to protect it through patent, copyright and design registration processes. Potential beneficiaries/partners will be sought through the ongoing collaborations with the Nuclear National Laboratory, Airbus, Rolls Royce and AgustaWestland UK, as well as the industrial partners of the EU FP7 ALAMSA and Horizon 2020 EXTREME projects. 

Policy: The UK is committed to reduction of emissions. Results from NUSIT that enable such reductions will help deliver such commitments.

Public: The general public will see health benefits from reduced emissions and financial benefits as reduced flight costs are converted to reduced ticket prices. Lighter aircraft may also result in less powerful engines being required and subsequently a reduction of noise near airports. The technological advances of NUSIT will reflect in higher quality of structured inspection that mitigate the risk of a latent nuclear safety event and provide public risk awareness and acceptance for nuclear power. Open access publication and public data storage will ensure all information relating to NUSIT is directly available to the public and to any aerospace or nuclear related UK companies. 

Staff: Ciampa and the PDRA will develop transferable knowledge of ultrasonic and thermography NDE inspection technologies and data interpretation/processing through collaborations and visits to industrial partners.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99398</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Although this project is only half of its completion, based on the preliminary results achieved on damaged aluminium components, the proposed nonlinear vibro-thermography has started attracting the attention of the UK Nuclear National Laboratory and Rolls-Royce, the industrial partners of this project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8DD26F79-085C-4FB8-A4C7-D8A8292C0E4F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This eighteen-month project has recently completed its half and there is already a number of finding to report as follows:
- As in the objectives, this project has initially focused on the experimental estimation of nonlinear elastic parameters on an aluminium sample with fatigue crack. This type of material and damage was of particular interest to one the industrial partners of the project (i.e. the UK Nuclear National Laboratory).
- A number of excitation frequencies using a surface boned piezoelectric transducer was found by measuring the nonlinear ultrasonic response with both a receiver piezo-transducer and a laser vibrometer.
- The nonlinear second order harmonic response was found the most reliable material nonlinear feature to excite the frictional heating at damage location.
- A nonlinear ultrasound parameter was created to compare the material nonlinear response to the actual temperature rises near the material damage.
- Thermal results revealed that the ultrasonically excited frictional response at damage location could be measured by an infrared camera, thus showing the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear vibro-thermography. 
- The velocity measurements with the laser vibrometer showed that it was possible to compare the local nonlinear ultrasound parameter for the damaged and undamaged regions with the temperature gradients of the crack at various excitation frequencies.
- This second half of the project will be mainly focused analysing the proposed nonlinear vibro-thermography (or nonlinear ultrasonic stimulated infrared thermography) method on composite components undergone to low velocity impacts. This type of material and damage is relevant to Rolls-Royce, the second industrial partner of this project.
- Along with the nonlinear vibro-thermography technique, two novel ultrasonic algorithms are under development with a sparse array of surface bonded ultrasonic transducers to localise micro damage in composite components.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The proposed methodologies developed in this project will benefit the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM) research and industrial communities, as nonlinear vibro-thermography will enhance the quantitative assessment of structural defects.
