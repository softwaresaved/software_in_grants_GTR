They also engaged with passing members of the public when not on stage, particularly around exhibitions on medical care in wartime and a professional actor and model horse in full period cavalry costume. The talks sparked questions and discussion. Audiences were stimulated to explore the history of the First World War more widely, through engagement with project partners and through independent research.

I was contacted by an audience member with a question about their research into their family history.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings were used to select and support 100 short radio pieces produced by BBC Radio Leeds, Radio York and Radio Sheffield.

The project deepened relationships between the BBC and the University of Leeds through collaborations involving radio, web and live appearances as well as working with journalists to co-produce research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The knowledge gained through the project will be further disseminated publications, talks and historical performance. The material archived by the BBC will continue to contribute to First World War commemorations, informing the research of the wider public.

The experienced gained of co-production of research for diverse audiences through a variety of media will be used to underpin future dissemination practices for the Legacies of War project (such as a podcast series relating to the project). The relationship between BBC local radio stations and the academics involved with the project continue to be built on as the centenary moves forward.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E825DFA2-3119-463E-AD3E-7665C609E17D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1cSGCxphvDxY0h5Vd7gnSGH/stories-by-bbc-radio-station</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L503708/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
