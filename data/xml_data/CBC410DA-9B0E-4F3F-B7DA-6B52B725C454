This will advance the field of forensic science, with the potential for applications in high profile cases that require the extraction of evidential information for courtroom purposes. In this project, the analyst is assumed to have the camera device or a set of trusted pictures taken by the same camera and whose acquisition time is known. The goal is then to date one or more images supposedly obtained from the same source and whose acquisition time is unknown. This application will obviously help forensic investigators analyse incidents and link different events.
The novelty of the proposed approach lies in (i) New techniques for efficiently estimating the sensor pattern noise for the purpose of temporal analysis (ii) Classification and temporal analysis of three types of pixels, namely, normal pixels, abnormal but not yet defective pixels, and defective pixels. (iii) Use of machine learning techniques to model the temporal behaviour of camera sensor imperfections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposed research would be of great help to forensic scientists and investigators in police forces throughout the UK and beyond since the extraction of informaion from digital images can be used for courtroom purposes. It should also have a positive economic impact in future by enabling the leading UK industrial companies to develop internationally competitive products for picture dating as this has not yet been considered in the UK and elsewhere. In a local context, we will transfer the skills and techniques gained during our investigation to other group members in the Conputer and Electronic security Systems Lab at Northumbria University and to our collaborators in this project. 

The results of this research project will be disseminated to the research community through publications at key international conferences and in high impact journals. Furthermore, under the main CESS website, a new webpage will be designed and updated regularly during the project for providing up-to-date details, experimental results, and free access to the standard dataset.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1- The system developed in this project has been tested and validated in source camera identification. The system can identify or verify the source camera that has been used to take a picture by just processing it. The system has been shown to be more reliable than existing ones in the literature. This could be adopted by digital forensics labs and companies in the courtroom to provide evidence which can solve criminal cases.
2- The last part of the project provides interesting findings about automatic picture dating. This also has applications in digital forensics to reinforce justice in the society.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1FD5A42E-5AB7-4849-8B34-D4868CBBBC0D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>-Digital cameras age with time and because they leave a fingerprint on pictures, it is possible to use this finding to estimate the acquisition date of digital pictures.

This includes: 2 x Panasonic TZ20, 2 x Fujifilm S2950, 2 x Nikon L330, 2 x Canon IXUS 115 HS, 2 x Samsung PL120. Two cameras of the same make and model are used to create the intra-model challenge in the numerical experiments. The images are taken in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments, for near and far objects of various textures under uncontrolled conditions to simulate the real world. Accordingly, the images can vary in contents, exposure, optical depth and other settings. Extra attention is paid whilst taking the pictures to fulfill an ethical conduct and avoid breaches of privacy of any kind. The cameras have been tuned to their automatic settings at the highest pixel density. The images are saved in JPEG format. The database is now complete and will be presented at a conference or journal paper before it is made public on the university website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>436987F8-1C19-4044-8C2E-4242DCF843AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There will be a significant impact in image forensics when the database is made available because it is the first of its kind and to the best of our knowledge there is no such a database available for applications in temporal forensics.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>New Image database for Temporal forensics</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6F68A1A3-76B1-44CE-8C3F-393A432685F2"><gtr:id>6F68A1A3-76B1-44CE-8C3F-393A432685F2</gtr:id><gtr:title>A novel image filtering approach for sensor fingerprint estimation in source camera identification</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1d78d9078bd18d46b9e9e975915a6484"><gtr:id>1d78d9078bd18d46b9e9e975915a6484</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Al-Ani M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BCB787FD-3FE2-4E95-8743-98C671F0FB1B"><gtr:id>BCB787FD-3FE2-4E95-8743-98C671F0FB1B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sensor Pattern Noise Estimation Based on Improved Locally Adaptive DCT Filtering and Weighted Averaging for Source Camera Identification and Verification</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f35e4db95b6b328d34424f7b6cf68d96"><gtr:id>f35e4db95b6b328d34424f7b6cf68d96</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawgaly A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/522315A1-92BF-4C62-A489-E8A414B13276"><gtr:id>522315A1-92BF-4C62-A489-E8A414B13276</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the SPN Estimation in Image Forensics: A Systematic Empirical Evaluation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1d78d9078bd18d46b9e9e975915a6484"><gtr:id>1d78d9078bd18d46b9e9e975915a6484</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Al-Ani M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F629EBAB-E7A3-4F00-AD15-321FD2CA4EF4"><gtr:id>F629EBAB-E7A3-4F00-AD15-321FD2CA4EF4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Weighted averaging-based sensor pattern noise estimation for source camera identification</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f35e4db95b6b328d34424f7b6cf68d96"><gtr:id>f35e4db95b6b328d34424f7b6cf68d96</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawgaly A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L006812/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
