However, this can be hard to spot because many of the tools used to diagnose autism were never designed with deaf people in mind. For example, some questions on the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R), a tool used by clinicians and researchers, will ask about how a child responds when someone calls their name and the autism diagnostic observation schedule uses a toy telephone to examine make believe play. 

The aim of this project is to develop and test a set of tools that will help us to identify and diagnose autism in deaf children. We plan to do this by adapting some of the existing measures of autism, so that they are fair tests that are accessible to deaf and hearing parents and can be used effectively with deaf children. We are going to do this with the help of deaf and hearing families, experts and researchers in the fields of deafness and autism, and organisations such as the National Autistic Society (NAS) and the National Deaf Children's Society (NDCS).

The objectives are split into stages.

In the first stage of the project we will interview a range of families about deafness and autism. This will involve deaf and hearing parents of deaf autistic children. The deaf children with autism will also have a play-based assessment called the ADOS 2. This will be compared to hearing children's symptoms of autism. 

We will then use this information and a review of research to design a questionnaire for parents and professionals. All this information will go to an expert panel to review look at the information from the interviews and start to inspect whether current items in the questionnaires are appropriate. A formal scoring questionnaire (called a Delphi Consensus) will then be used with deaf autism international experts to identify modifications. They will suggest items that can be included without change, ones that needs adapting (and suggest changes), and ones that should be rejected. Revisions will be re-circulated with further scoring until an agreement can be reached. We will use agreement levels as our first milestone. 

In the 2nd stage, the newly adapted questionnaires will then be translated into British Sign Language (BSL) using a strict translation/back translation methodology. A group of translators will video the items in BSL, and then another group of translators who have not seen the original questionnaire will translate them back into English. This process will repeat as necessary. Then focus groups of deaf people will check the translations and may suggest more changes. Once there is agreement, the original authors will check final versions. 

We will check that the new items and questionnaires work well in the 3rd stage when we will use them with

65 deaf children with autism
65 deaf children without autism (+ 65 more for screening)
65 hearing children with autism
65 hearing children without autism

We will collect a range of other important information about epidemiology language, intelligence etc.

After the first 20 autistic children have been recruited, we will undertake a futility analysis. This lets us see if there is benefit in continuing the research by checking with statistics if the results are looking promising (milestone 2). 

We will also look at whether it is good at picking up autism in children that do have autism (sensitivity), and good at ruling autism out in children that don't have autism (specificity). 

This will help us identify and diagnose autism better in young people who are deaf. It will also make it more accessible by being available in many deaf people's first language. This will mean earlier diagnosis and earlier treatment. We will develop training for National Deaf Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and other clinicians in using the new measures for screening and assessing for autism spectrum disorders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Design: Modification of screening and assessment instruments for autism spectrum disorders, followed by translation, and field testing to establish robust validity and reliability, compared to instruments used with hearing children.

Setting: National Deaf Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (four main centres and six outreach centres) with strong academic, clinical expert and user partnership involvement.

Target Population: Children and young people aged 2-18 who have a permanent bilateral hearing loss of 40 dB or more, who have been referred for an assessment for an autism spectrum disorder, and selected assessment groups.

Outcomes: Fully validated and reliable screening and assessment instruments for autism in deaf children. This will be acceptable to users and we will evidence key psychometric properties of these instruments.

Sample Size: 195 children and young people for assessment instruments (260 for screening)

Milestones 
Milestone 1: agreement on Delphi Consensus of 80% (75% acceptable). If not met will lead to cessation of grant with further field research being pursued. 
Milestone 2: futility analysis after 20 deaf children with and 20 without autism recruited. 0.8 under ROC curve (0.75 acceptable). If the area under ROC curve were 0.8, this would correspond to a difference in mean score of 1.2 standard deviations. To detect the existence of a difference between means with power 0.95 if the true difference were 1.2 would require 19 in each group. If we do not detect a significant difference the test will be deemed unsuitable for diagnostic purposes. This will lead to a cessation of the grant with further research into autism in deaf children and a new approach to screening with further grant applications and discussions with MRC.
Milestone 3: 60% of target population recruited by 30 months (55% acceptable). Failure to meet this will result in meeting with MRC and steering group and urgent recruitment strategies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
Children and Families
Deaf children and families will benefit from this research since it will provide new and more accurate tools for screening, assessment and diagnosis.

This will lead to earlier diagnosis since many children are not being assessed because services believe that they do not have the skills to assess for autism in deaf children, as evidenced by Social Policy Unit Research (2008/9/10).

This in turn will lead to earlier interventions and intervention planning and may lead to more appropriate and earlier support. This in turn will lead to potentially better outcomes for deaf children with autism. Research suggests that early intervention in autism is very helpful as it does for deaf children. Early intervention in deaf children WITH autism is therefore likely to be effective. We plan to research this.

Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) clinicians who assess for autism will benefit since it will generate much better guidance on screening and assessment for autism in deaf children.

Clinical beneficiaries will include wider groups than child psychiatrists and clinical psychologists and there has already been interest from cochlear implant centres and child mental health staff in generic child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) services and specialist National Deaf CAMH ten centres in England. There is also international interest. Recent conferences in Austria (June 2012) and York (October 2011) have highlighted this. Other disciplines such as paediatricians and speech and language therapists in Health services and Educational Psychologists in Local Authority services will also benefit.

We believe that at the end of this research the new tools will be immediately available for use, and we will make time available to provide training materials (DVD, manual) for their use.

Staff working on this project will develop a range of skills and experience of assessing multiple children that will greatly help in improving services and expertise across the country.

The results will provide policy makers with much better estimates of autism prevalence within the deaf child population. This will inform education and social care provision and we will be working closely with stakeholders such as National Deaf Children's Society and the Social Research for Deaf People (SORD) unit at Manchester University.

Public Health and National Strategic Importance
Benefits may also accrue more widely to society. For example, we have come across deaf teenagers with severe behaviour problems with autism where the diagnosis was not made in early life and where the child has gone from school to school because of expulsions eventually going to deaf residential school. Such young men will have ongoing behaviour problems in adulthood and need long term care. It is our belief that early assessment, diagnosis and intervention planning may have led to much improved understanding of difficulties and better outcomes.

The research may benefit society by leading to more cost-effective interventions which help young people learn skills that can be productive for them and society. It has great potential to lead to enhancement in the quality of life of young people and their families, with improved health outcomes and greater creative output. We plan to research this.

The research will also help to publicise the importance of Deaf culture leading to greater deaf awareness in schools and society. 

This research will make the UK leaders in this field. England is the only country that has a National Deaf Child Mental Health Service with good geographical spread nationally, and is a flagship in this area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>564076</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>DIADS - Delphi Consensus</gtr:description><gtr:id>D53E9743-776D-44BD-9132-44D37AA5A688</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Delphi Consensus process has now been completed.

It was a good opportunity to share information about the project with people external to our team. It helped to raise awareness about providing equitable access for deaf people, through the translation of materials into British Sign Language. We were also able to share our experiences of the translation process, which can be applied to translation of other materials into other languages.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.leedspft.nhs.uk/professionals/RD</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of &quot;A futility analysis for a diagnostic study&quot; at Institute of Applied Health, University of Birmingham, 9th November, 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>86B397CB-DB88-488D-AAD6-68EE2FDD0A68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Martin Bland, Emeritus Prof. of Health Statistics, gave a presentation and from University of York. in Birmingham there were 30 attended and mainly are statisticians and other health researchers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference was called:   Positive futures for deaf children  10th/11th March 2017  Manchester Conference Centre, University of Manchester, 'Professor Barry Wright gave a talk called 'Improving the mental health of deaf children and young people'.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>62CF9EB9-0C07-4627-BEC8-01D79E9868B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave a presentation titled 'D/deaf children - How can we help when they struggle emotionally' to teachers of the deaf.

The research team used an online survey platform to present the Delphi members with the original assessment items and response options (keep the original item, keep but with modifications, discard the item) and comment boxes (suggested modifications, reasons for discarding items). Once members of the Delphi had responded to items from the original assessments the research team organised an expert panel meeting. These meetings involved experts in deafness and autism from England, linguists, academics and researchers. Discussion focussed on the responses and comments made by Delphi members for each item. Where items had response options that were shared by 80% (or more) of the Delphi members these items were considered agreed. Where the Delphi member responses were mixed the expert panel suggested changes in line with the Delphi member comments. These suggested modifications to items were then sent to Delphi members in subsequent rounds of the Delphi process. An expert panel meeting was assembled following each round of responses from Delphi members. Once all items had reached 80% agreement the tool was considered adapted. The adapted tools were sent to the respective authors of the original assessments to gain their permission to translate the adapted items into British Sign Language and include the adapted tools in the validation stage of this research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>532C147C-C62A-4218-AEB0-895E5D762139</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research team now has an adapted version of the SRS-2, ADOS-2 and ADi-R which are considered by international experts in deafness and autism (with 80% agreement) to be more appropriate than the original assessments for use with deaf children in the assessment of autism.

The Delphi Consensus process has been completed and authors have given permission to the research team to translate aspects of the adapted assessments into British Sign Language. Authors have also given permission for the adapted assessments to be included in the validation stage of this research.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Delphi Consensus Methodology</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The research team have translated the written English text from the adapted SRS-2 questions, mandatory questions from the adapted ADi-R, and the examiner's script from the adapted ADOS-2. This process involved forward translators (two deaf bilingual people [English and BSL], one a deaf qualified interpreter and the other a deaf lay person) who translated the written English text from the adapted tools into video BSL clips. The research team then sent the video BSL clips to back translators (two deaf bilingual people [English and BSL], one a deaf qualified interpreter and the other a deaf lay person) who were blind to the written English. The back translators watched the BSL clips independently and translated the information into written English. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion between the back translators, before the English back translations were given to the research team. A team of researchers with knowledge of BSL, English and the tools compared the original English, the BSL clip and the English back translation for each item. Translations which matched in terms of concept, linguistics and culture were agreed. Items which were not considered to meet these criteria were sent to the forward translators for a new translation and the process started again. 

For items which had gone through two or more translations without agreement, the team arranged an expert panel meeting. Individuals who attended these meetings included clinicians (who were trained and routinely using the tools being translated), linguists, forward translators, one back translator (who was unblinded for the items discussed in the meeting) and researchers. During expert panel meetings, the group discussed the items which were proving difficult to translate; in terms of the meaning of the items, any cultural differences which were affecting the translations, and possible solutions. New forward translations of these items were created which were subsequently sent to the remaining blind back translator for translation into English. 

Once all items had an agreed BSL translation, these were then filmed to produce a final BSL translation in DVD format for each assessment to be used within the validation stage of this research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>68A22434-02F6-41CD-B307-76D858CCA107</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Having a BSL translation of the screening tool SRS-2 enables parents in the validation study who use BSL as their main language to complete this tool in their preferred language. 

The translation of the mandatory questions from the adapted ADi-R enables clinicians who use BSL to ask questions in their preferred language, and provides a training aid for interpreters who might work with clinicians who do not use BSL and are interviewing parents who use BSL as their preferred language. 

The BSL translation of the examiner's script from the adapted ADOS-2 is useful for training of clinicians who will conduct ADOS-2 assessments with deaf children using BSL.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Translating assessments from English into British Sign Language (BSL)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E29A0994-AD59-4F69-A9A9-46878EBE58AA"><gtr:id>E29A0994-AD59-4F69-A9A9-46878EBE58AA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Does socio-emotional developmental delay masquerade as autism in some deaf children?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of mental Health and Deafness</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1cfc428e032429d8f9b98029b8ee3d4a"><gtr:id>1cfc428e032429d8f9b98029b8ee3d4a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wright B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K015435/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>5585DDA6-FCF6-4B64-8332-1BDFE62CE94E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ear</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>3BEA012A-C817-4067-8BE1-05331EBB5152</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.2  Evaluation of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
