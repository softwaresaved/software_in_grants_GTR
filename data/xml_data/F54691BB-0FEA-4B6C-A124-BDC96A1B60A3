Policy areas like agriculture, the environment, fisheries, regional development and justice and home affairs, are both matters for the devolved parliaments and also areas that fall under the authority of the EU. In these policy fields, the EU has provided a common framework that has limited the degree of difference that has emerged within and across the UK, and this has helped keep the nations of the UK together. Whichever model is reached after negotiations, the UK's withdrawal from the EU will affect the powers of the devolved nations in complex ways. It may lead to further decentralisation of power to the devolved institutions. Alternatively, it could lead to powers being recentralized within UK-wide institutions. A third possibility is that it could see the setting up of new forums and process to enable the UK Government and the devolved governments to cooperate more closely on policy areas where their powers overlap. The outcome of the negotiations, and the decisions taken by key actors, will have consequences for the powers and responsibilities of institutions in the devolved nations and their relationships with the rest of the UK. This project will carry out a study of these developments as the Brexit negotiations get underway, and we will examine how the outcomes will shape devolution and relations between the UK's four governments. We will study and support the role of parliaments in scrutinizing the Brexit negotiation processes and the outcomes. We will meet with civil servants to help them understand the effects of different Brexit options on devolution in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Our project will focus on three particular areas of devolved policy - agriculture, the environment and justice and home affairs - to investigate the particular consequences of bringing powers back from the EU to the UK after Brexit. We will work with professionals and representatives from these sectors to help them prepare and plan for Brexit under different scenarios. We will also enhance broader understanding of the process, outcomes and their impact on devolution by producing easy to read and easy to access explanations, analyses and reports, and by taking up opportunities for commenting in the media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have four impact objectives: to inform broader understanding of the impact of Brexit on the scope and dynamics of devolution within the UK; to enhance parliamentary oversight by providing briefing materials, evidence and advice to relevant parliamentary committees as they scrutinise the negotiation process and outcomes; to support officials in developing their understanding of the effects of Brexit on the distribution of competences and intergovernmental relations within the UK; and to support key stakeholders in three policy sectors - agriculture, the environment and justice and home affairs - in understanding the interface between Brexit and devolution in their sector. In addition, we have an over-arching objective of enhancing the profile and research impact of the UK in a Changing Europe initiative among key audiences across the devolved territories.

Our engagement activities will build upon the three years of experience and knowledge exchange conducted by the Centre on Constitutional Change (CCC), within which all members of the project team collaborated. We will match this to the expertise, networks and platform of the UK in a Changing Europe initiative. Activities will respond to events and opportunities as they unfold, but will include five academic-practitioner workshops on (i) Brexit, devolution and agriculture; (ii) Brexit, devolution and the environment; (iii) Brexit, devolution and justice; (iv) Intergovernmental relations after Brexit; (v) Brexit, devolution and EU relations. The latter will be targeted at officials and academics from beyond the UK. Each of these will lead to a substantial research report which will be disseminated widely among target audiences, and used to provide further, more tailored briefings to specific organisations.

We have identified five target research users: parliamentarians; government officials; ambassadorial and consular staff; policy stakeholders; and the public. We will engage with parliamentarians across the UK, in Ireland and the EU to inform their understanding of the effects of Brexit scenarios on devolution, and enhance their capacity to scrutinise governmental action. In so doing, we will use our positions as expert advisers to parliamentary committees in the Scottish and Westminster parliaments, and take up opportunities to provide written and oral evidence to committee enquiries. We will nurture relationships with key government officials, building on an extensive high-level relations nurtured over the past three years. We will provide them with advance notice of new findings, oral advice as well as written briefing papers, and a private space for governments individually or collectively to subject ideas and proposals to independent evaluation. We will exploit regular invitations to inform diplomats, politicians and judges from the EU and beyond about the implications of Brexit for constitutional and territorial politics within the UK. We will support professional stakeholders in our three policy sectors to prepare and plan for different Brexit scenarios, and to evaluate the impact of Brexit outcomes on policy and finance within their sector. Building on our extensive experience of conveying complex ideas in fresh, clear and accessible styles, without compromising impartiality or academic authority, we will disseminate our findings in blogs, briefing papers, short reports, podcasts, Twitter feed, media commentary and analysis in print and broadcast media across the UK and internationally. The latter will include specialist sector-focused programmes and publications, newspapers, and more popular outlets such as radio phone-ins and prime time TV programmes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>236373</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R001308/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A4CA3E5-9CDA-4B38-9C9E-5F8023D4603E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>EU Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>10601309-838E-4D0F-A4EE-B765E0CB1A81</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
