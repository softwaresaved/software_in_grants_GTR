In Malawi, one of the 10 poorest countries in the world, initial enrolment in school is high, but half the children drop out by the end of year 6, and only a third complete the 8 years of primary school. Drop-out in adolescence is higher in girls than in boys, and often follows early pregnancy and marriage. Using data from a large population-based study with annual surveys in northern Malawi (&amp;gt; 10,000 children), and a study that has followed &amp;gt;2500 adolescents over time in southern Malawi, we propose to explore the pathways to drop-out and their causes. 

Important questions that we will address include: 

Do girls drop out of school because they are pregnant, or do they get pregnant because they were already disaffected with or failing school? 

How far is an adolescent's own school behaviour influenced by the schooling or sexual behaviour of their peers or siblings?

What attributes of the schools, of families and of the community reduce drop-out?

This research is a collaboration between academic researchers and those working in the Ministry of Education in Malawi, at national and district levels, allowing lessons learnt to influence education policy and practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The academic beneficiaries and dissemination are discussed above.

The ultimate beneficiaries of this research are the children and adolescents in Malawi, who will benefit from any changes in policy and practice that are made based on the findings. 

The main aim of the project is to work in partnership with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) in Malawi and other stakeholders to inform and influence the three priority areas of the MoEST's National Education Sector Plan (NESP) 2007-18. The three priority areas are improving: (i) access and equity; ii) quality; and iii) governance and management of schooling in Malawi. The project will contribute to meeting MDG 2 (universal primary education) and MDG 3 (gender parity in primary and secondary education). 

Findings from this study will benefit a wide range of stakeholders within Malawi, in the UK and beyond. The MoEST, who are the non-academic partners in this study, are critical players who are best positioned to influence and establish priorities in education policy, resource allocation and service delivery in Malawi. They have collaborations with a broad spectrum of stakeholders across the board. These include bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors (UN, World Bank, JICA, CIDA, DFID); organisations involved in improving the quality of secondary education and it's delivery through the Private Sector (e.g. PRISM-Private Schools Association of Malawi); non-governmental organisations who are actively involved in bridging the gaps in service delivery and advocating for improving access and delivery of schooling in the country, who are part of larger Civil Society Networks (e.g the CONGO-Coalition of NGOs in Malawi, FAWEMA- Forum for African Women Educationalists in Malawi, SACMEQ- South African Consortium for Monitoring Education Quality). Our collaboration with the MoE and its partners provides an opportunity for the study to reach and disseminate study findings to a large network of education stakeholders which will help influence, engage and jointly shape education interventions and policies in the country. 

Study activities include dissemination of project progress, findings and recommendations through District and National level stakeholder platforms (District Executive Meetings, Consultative meetings, Primary Education Advisor meetings and Sector Review meetings), where policies and implementation plans are shaped. Study findings will be disseminated through an end-of-project Dissemination workshop, which will bring together a wider group of education stakeholders and partners who are engaged in the education dialogue; policy briefs, which will be circulated through the MoEST and partners (local, international); open-access publications; and presentation of project findings at public lectures, conferences, poster exhibitions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160919</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Stephanie Psaki is a member of the Research Task Force of the Global Working Group to End School-Related Gender Based Violence (SRGBV), organized by the UN Girls' Education Initiative and USAID to develop tools to help build the evidence base on SRGBV.

What our new work in Karonga District, northern Malawi shows is that although many children are dropping out at an early stage, they are often not dropping out until their late teens. At age 15 about 90% of children are still in school. But by age 19 less than half of children have completed primary school. 30% of boys and 50% of girls have dropped out and the rest are still attending primary. This happens because of repetition of grades. This represents a missed opportunity to educate these children. 

The average age-for-grade increases with grade for both boys and girls. Risk factors identified that were associated with repetition included both family-level factors (living away from their mother, having young children in the household, lower parental education) and school-level factors (higher student-teacher ratio, proportion of female teachers and schools without access to water). 

In our studies in northern Malawi only 48% of girls compared to 58% of boys ultimately completed primary school. Being overage for their grade was a strong risk factor for dropout for both girls and boys. Most household-level and school-level risk factors associated with dropout were similar for boys and girls, including: lower socio-economic status, lower education of parents, living with only one or neither parent, living closer to the school, not having access to water at school, having a high student:teacher ratio and having a low proportion of female teachers. 

School absenteeism is common, and equal in boys and girls: 15% of girls and 16% of boys missed at least one day of school in the past four weeks. The main reason given for missing school is illness (but this may partly be because it is a socially acceptable reason). Children from households with lower socio-economic status are more likely to be absent. Children from households with higher agricultural wealth, and those engaged in economic activity are more likely to be absent - suggesting they are spending time assisting with the farming and other income earning.

Taken together these findings suggest that school-level and home-level factors both contribute to drop-out, partly, but not only, through repetition of standards and children becoming increasingly over-age for their grade. Since 90% are still in school at 15, interventions that ensure children move through school at the correct pace would enable them to complete primary education before the competing pressures of puberty and economics intervene.

Analyses in southern Malawi assessed the impact of school and domestic violence on schooling outcomes. School-related sexual violence was associated with poorer subsequent education outcomes for males and, to a lesser extent, for females; domestic violence was associated with higher absenteeism for males and subsequent dropout for females; but physical violence was associated with lower absenteeism and better subsequent numeracy performance for females.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Research is still in progress</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>132C11BF-4505-4860-9163-472256984979</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/929985D4-C95D-401E-8BCE-BEB0A0AFD42A"><gtr:id>929985D4-C95D-401E-8BCE-BEB0A0AFD42A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Re-examining the link between socioeconomic status and school absenteeism: evidence from primary school pupils in northern Malawi.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8e72cb441e7297eae6a81310f426c1be"><gtr:id>8e72cb441e7297eae6a81310f426c1be</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelly CA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7636A6E3-2328-44D2-8249-80AAE4784A11"><gtr:id>7636A6E3-2328-44D2-8249-80AAE4784A11</gtr:id><gtr:title>Falling behind in school: Does age-for-grade heterogeneity matter?
