This technique provides information about the vibronic 'fingerprint' of a molecule located close to plasmonic nanostructures and therefore allows for a unique classification of the type of analyte detected. This method has also been proven to have a single-molecule detection capability. SERS-based approaches have enabled a number of important applications in bioanalytical sensing, such as in vivo tumour targeting, glucose sensing at clinically relevant concentrations and microbial system analysis, and are considered a major prerequisite for progress in areas such as nanobiotechnology and personalised medicine. In spite of the apparent advantages over commonly used fluorescence-based methods, SERS is yet to be established as an analytical tool. This is, in part, due to the fact that small variations in the SERS substrate (preparation, aggregation, surface morphology, etc.) have drastic effects on the SERS performance. Therefore the stability and reproducibility issues of SERS-active substrates have to be addressed in order to facilitate its application in quantitative analysis.

Current fabrication techniques of SERS substrates with moderate to high enhancement factors, and reproducible and uniform responses are dominated by e-beam lithography, nano-imprint, self-assembled nanosphere, hybrid nanoporous lithography methods, etc. These techniques are still costly and rather cumbersome for production of large area SERS substrates, hence the high price of commercially available SERS platforms. 

The focus of this project is to demonstrate novel SERS platforms based on laser-engineered nanocomposite systems for dramatically improved performance and fabrication control, addressing current SERS materials limitations. Tailored Ag-/Au-ion and Ag-/Au-nanoparticle doped substrates with different dopant concentrations and volume filling factors will be fabricated suitable for SERS analysis with frequently used excitation wavelengths in the spectral region from 400 to 1000 nm. A spatially selective nanocomposite annealing technique will be developed in order to realise large area planar platforms with controllable geometry and reproducible enhancement factors, allowing a step change in fabrication of robust sensing platforms for quantitative SERS analysis. Furthermore, the proposed material systems will form the building blocks of a future microfluidic sensing devices for biomedical, environmental and security applicatons.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In today's scientific and industrial areas Raman spectroscopy is appreciated for a number of different reasons. The technique provides a 'spectral fingerprint' of a molecule that can be used for analytical proposes in a variety of cases, for instance in quality control or sorting of mixed plastics waste for the recycling industry. It is well suited for analysis of solid, liquid and gas samples without the need for laborious sample preparation. Recent major improvements in Raman instrumentation and excitation sources have dramatically reduced costs, making it an ever-more accessible analytical technique. The main obstacle to widespread implementation of Raman spectroscopy is that the Raman effect is very weak. In this context, SERS combines all advantages of the Raman technique, notably the high specificity, with greatly increased sensitivity. This extends the application scope of SERS to analytical chemistry and biochemistry, forensics and trace analysis of medicines, drugs, explosives, etc. In the context of SERS implementation for trace detection, it is essential to design sensing platforms that are stable, robust, and reproducible which can be produced at reduced cost and, if necessary, on a large scale. 

Over the past few years, there has been a notable shift in the development of SERS substrates geared toward practical applications where high reproducibility and enhancement are paramount. The research proposed here contributes to the development of advanced functional materials for sensing applications and expands the area of SERS in analytical chemistry for routine in-the-field quantitative sampling. The proposed composite systems and laser-based techniques will enable cost-effective large-scale controllable production of SERS planar sensing platforms featuring robustness, reproducibility, stability and ease of integration into microfluidic devices for rapid multiplexed SERS assays. 

The interdisciplinary nature of this project represents a unique opportunity for the early carrier PDRA and PhD student (supported by Lancaster University) to engage in the laser-assisted micro-/nano- processing, nanocomposite fabrication, characterisation, and translation of these material systems into sensing platforms. The knowledge and hands-on experience acquired by the young scientists working on this project will be extremely beneficial for the individuals' career development. It will also contribute to the UK's future skilled workforce in materials, photonics and analytical sciences where cross-fertilisation with other fields will be crucial to fully exploit their innovation potential.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101078</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P008135/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9CD2DA3B-F052-4076-95ED-10F46E76C382</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Optics, photonics &amp; lasers</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>94012EE3-786C-4415-82EC-D8A241F3F4FE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Optical Phenomena</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
