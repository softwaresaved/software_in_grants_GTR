Even the most cursory glance along the spines of the books on the library shelves reveal a set of post-millennium titles that hardly engender confidence that all is well ('Disaffected Democracies', 'Democratic Challenges', 'Democratic Choices', 'Political Disaffection in Contemporary Democracies', 'Hatred of Democracy', 'Why We Hate Politics', 'Democratic Deficit', 'Vanishing Voters', 'Democracy in Retreat', 'Uncontrollable Societies and Disaffected Individuals, etc.). The 'civic culture' so endeared by Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba had somehow mutated into a 'critical culture' with parallel pessimism about the future of democracy. It is exactly this context that this project examines the capacity and value of artistic and cultural activities to re-engage disconnected individuals and social groups. Put slightly differently, does culture have a social value in terms of a potential capacity to close the gap between the governors and the governed? Several scholars - and indeed ancient philosophers - have suggested that a positive relationship exists between artistic endeavours and activities and civic values and democratic engagement but as yet no study has attempted to either (1) undertake a meta-analysis of the available research and data, or (2) undertake a specific project that examines individual social values and attitudes before and after an art-based social project, let alone (3) attempted to devise an evidence-based methodology for quantifying the civic value of cultural activity. By working with a range of actors - including the Royal Society of Arts, the House of Commons Outreach Department, 'Art in the Park' and the Crick Centre for the Public Understanding of Politics at the University of Sheffield - and launching an innovative inter-generational arts project this research will produce outputs that address each of these three challenges. This research will not - indeed cannot - come to any broad or sweeping conclusions and its findings will inevitably be contested but it will deliver theoretically informed policy-relevant research that moves the debate about cultural value forward in a positive and evidence-based manner.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Pathways to Impact include - 

Academic - Two journal articles, Case Study Briefing placed on the Participedia global database.

Practitioner - Two practitioner reports, End of Project Workshop hosted by the RSA, Memorandum of Evidence to the Political and Constitutional 

Public - Documentary film, numerous blogs and newspaper articles. Discussions with the BBC have already begun in relation to whether this project could form the focus of a documentary or slot in an established programme 

Strategic Liaison - 'Arts in the Park' and RSA signed-up as formal partners. House of Commons Outreach Team and the Cabinet Office's Democratic Engagement Team are already aware of this potential project and are keen to monitor its roll-out and findings.

Group A was made up from a LGBT club which took place in the centre of Sheffield and attracted young people from across the city. There were 6 participants in this group. The workshops took place over three days, with five hour workshops each day. This group worked with a photographer/visual artist. The participants created a number of images, however, mainly spent their time working together on a collage piece which artistically represented their past, present and future. This group demonstrated a high level of interest in politics from the beginning and 100% had signed a petition and taken part in a public demonstration or protest within the last two years. Most of these demonstrations and petitions were related to LGBT issues. 

Group B was based in a youth club in Shiregreen which met every Wednesday afternoon. The workshops took place over a two month period of two hour sessions running alongside the standard youth club provisions.The ward of Shiregreen has some of the lowest voter turnouts and is amongst the highest rates of deprivation in the city, falling with the 20% most deprived areas in the UK. (Dorling et al., 2009).. 
Group C was comprised of art and/or politics AS level students at Tapton Secondary School. There were eight participants in this group. These workshops took place over 3 days, with five hour workshops each day. The school has been ranked 'Outstanding' by Ofsted and is located in the Broomhill ward, which is one of the most affluent wards not only in Sheffield, but in the whole of the UK (Dorling et al. 2009). The participants worked with a installation artist/ set designer to create a tipi comprised of maps and models which demonstrated inequalities of income, education and power within Sheffield and the UK as a whole.


Participants reporting being 84% more likely to vote. 

Furthermore the young people demonstrated an increased understanding of the use of art as a political means: 'The whole thing about the art, like bringing things to light, making people aware of
them [issues]' and 'Using the skills I have to affect things like rather than petitions and stuff, do a project like this'</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Participants reported being more likely to vote and engage with democratic process.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1FAC1244-4287-4CF8-8636-CD527A144085</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The findings of this Development Grant have started to substantiate a strong and positive link between participatory arts and civic/political engagement. Overall, the results showed changes in attitudes within each level of political
engagement as a result of the participatory arts workshops. 

This grant has therefore revealed the potential utility of 'art for politics'; that is, the use of participatory arts as a form of political expression and a medium through which sections of society can not only express themselves politically but also how they can nurture the skills of political literacy and the values of active citizenship. In the context of rising disengagement with politics, particularly amongst young people, this is an important and increasingly urgent area of research in terms of cultural value and a well balanced and equal democracy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further use of participatory arts to nuture political literacy and political engagement</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C4C23E9F-782D-44CB-87AA-B21A7260AABF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.crickcentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AHRC_Cultural_Value.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1DA07FCE-08E9-486B-998A-5781EF6F7759"><gtr:id>1DA07FCE-08E9-486B-998A-5781EF6F7759</gtr:id><gtr:title>Explaining democratic disaffection: Closing the expectations gap</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/720003b2262fcc256dbb7b0026fa5114"><gtr:id>720003b2262fcc256dbb7b0026fa5114</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flinders, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/36D2E3B5-CAF2-4605-B856-ED76C29E91AC"><gtr:id>36D2E3B5-CAF2-4605-B856-ED76C29E91AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Participatory Arts and Political Engagement</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a55b9450d49beee0be47b7dfe36f0c0e"><gtr:id>a55b9450d49beee0be47b7dfe36f0c0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flinders, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/49037AF9-C53F-4A00-8C3C-A8881F51EB91"><gtr:id>49037AF9-C53F-4A00-8C3C-A8881F51EB91</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dangerous minds: 'Public' political science or 'punk' political science?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/720003b2262fcc256dbb7b0026fa5114"><gtr:id>720003b2262fcc256dbb7b0026fa5114</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flinders, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/92889410-2454-42DE-9D0D-690368C82C43"><gtr:id>92889410-2454-42DE-9D0D-690368C82C43</gtr:id><gtr:title>DIY democracy: Festivals, parks, and fun</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/720003b2262fcc256dbb7b0026fa5114"><gtr:id>720003b2262fcc256dbb7b0026fa5114</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flinders, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5A7CD96B-CD4B-469F-BCE1-D2568DDC4CBF"><gtr:id>5A7CD96B-CD4B-469F-BCE1-D2568DDC4CBF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Democracy Day: We've got to break free</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/720003b2262fcc256dbb7b0026fa5114"><gtr:id>720003b2262fcc256dbb7b0026fa5114</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flinders, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B265D06B-AEFE-424A-9EFB-344396010418"><gtr:id>B265D06B-AEFE-424A-9EFB-344396010418</gtr:id><gtr:title>Where next?
