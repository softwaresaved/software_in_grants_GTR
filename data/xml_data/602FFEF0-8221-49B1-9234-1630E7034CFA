The centralaspect of the MGS is the training of PhD students in the mathematical foundations of computing, by means of a yearlySpring School that provides a series of technical courses on introductory, advanced and emerging topics.This application is to seek continued EPSRC support for the MGS -- which it has enjoyed in recent years via threesuccessive grants -- by means of funding twenty places for PhD students at the 2010 event, together with support for the invited lecturers, and (as required under full economic costing), the local organisers and thedirector of the MGS. This application will secure the future of the MGS for the next year, and hence contribute tomaintaining the leading position of the UK in theoretical computer science.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impact of the Midland Graduate School is as follows: 1.) The MGS helps increasing the quality and the success rate of UK PhD projects by bridging an essential gap between teaching curriculae and cutting edge research. 2.) It produces mathematically trained PhD graduates in Computer Science, which are in short supply in the UK, yet needed as future academics as well as in high-tech companies, where analytical thinking and mastery of advanced research methods are mandatory, and in the public sector, where strategic thinking and communication skills are essential. 3.) It delivers transferable skills that transcend existing technologies, and make participants flexible with respect to market demands and adaptable with respect to innovations. 4.) It brings PhD students in contact with future academic employers. 5.) It gives UK PhD graduates an advantage over competitors from other countries by broadening their expertise. 6.) It helps to ensure the world-leading position of UK Science Education, worth several billion pounds to the UK economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3184</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This grant supported the Midlands Graduate School 2010. This School taught advanced courses in theoretical Computer Science to 40 PhD-students predominantly in their first year. These courses are essential for the completion of a good PhD.
