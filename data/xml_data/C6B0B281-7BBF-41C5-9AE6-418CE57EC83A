Most of the settlements that have been achieved involved international facilitation or mediation by a variety of actors. The UN has been the principal actor in this respect, but regional organisations, sub-regional actors, individual governments and non-governmental actors have also been involved. The list of resulting peace agreements is vast and imposing, representing a repository of international practice that has scarcely been mined by scholarship in a comprehensive and systematic way. 
There is no shortage of academic writings in the area of conflict settlement and peace-making in political science and international relations literature. However, there is a remarkable gap in the treatment of this area from a legal perspective. Professor Christine Bell is one of the only legal scholars engaging with the topic. Moreover, there is no systematic review of the substantive practice of peace-making in its entirety. This project will be the first to offer such an ambitious review and assessment of all known practice.
What is more, there are currently approximately 40 on-going internationalised peace negotiations, covering a wide range of issue areas that need to be addressed in an eventual settlement. At present settlement options need to be researched afresh in every new peace negotiation in relation to each of the issue areas that arise. The outputs of this project will dispense with this time-consuming task as the project will offer detailed settlement options to international peace processes. 

This project aims to give coherence to the burgeoning practice of internationalised peace-making, offering practice-relevant guidance for mediators, while gaining important conceptual insights into the nature of this rapidly developing area of law. The project's objectives are to: 
(a) generate an analytical digest of settlement practice, offering for the first time detailed and accessible examples from previous treaties in relation to all specific issues that tend to arise; 
(b) offer case-studies on the major issue-areas of concern, highlighting different settlement options, relevant past experiences, and their relationship to other legal standards. The project will generate a shorter Handbook on Peace-making for practitioners on this basis; 
(c) investigate, at a more conceptual level, in a major collective study, to what extent the trends in settlements, which will be revealed through this analysis, evidence a change in international legal rules in relation to individual issue areas; 
(d) consider whether such developments constitute a new and distinct branch of international law (lex pacificatoria) and ask whether this specialist practice risks fragmenting the unitary legal system. 

As the project will be conducted in coordination with the UN and other major international organisations involved in international peace-making, it has unique access to practitioners placing it in a position where it can learn from them and also impact on their actions. 
Currently, in peace negotiations each issue has to be researched afresh by the mediation team and the parties to negotiations, as there is no substantive repository of approaches to the settlement of specific issues based on previous practice. Moreover, even where previous examples can be found, there is no time to assess how the approach in question has been implemented, and with what results. 
The project will offer a legal toolkit, or a set of options, regarding the general and specific problems, that typically arise in negotiations, providing guidance to the array of actors involved in creating peace agreements; thereby diminishing the present significant divergence in the quality of mediation attempts. It would also bring relief to the unhelpful asymmetry among the parties to peace mediations, currently favouring governments</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As was mentioned above, the project will make a significant contribution to the development of international law scholarship in relation to peace-making, along with making new invaluable digital resources available to researchers in the fields of international law, international relations, and other disciplines investigating into areas surrounding conflict settlement.
Yet the most significant impact the project can have is a practical one - it has the potential to significantly assist in the various peace negotiations all around the world and thereby contribute to the facilitation of peace. The project outputs would be important resources for all participants of peace negotiations. Currently, without the project outputs, more or less the same research and background work needs to be done - and done again - in each new instance in relation to the substantive issue areas that require settlement. This may involve the trawling through of hundreds of peace settlements each time, with a view to identifying useful previous examples and experiences, wasting valuable time and effort. It is of course necessary to develop peace settlements that specifically address each individual situation; there are no general solutions equally applicable to all cases. But the project outputs would offer guidance about which type of solutions have worked in what kind of circumstances. 
The project would also help address the unhelpful asymmetry among the parties to peace mediations. Governments may have the tools to prepare their positions on the basis of an understanding of previous practice, but invariably opposition groups are not able to engage in the necessary research effort. A lack of understanding of settlement options and of previous relevant experiences often constitutes a major obstacle in negotiations. The project outputs would certainly assist in creating a level playing field for both parties.
One set of &amp;quot;users&amp;quot; of the research outputs are international organisations that often engage in mediation efforts. The project answers an urgent demand from such international organisations for practice-oriented guidance. These &amp;quot;users&amp;quot; will also be involved in the project throughout its duration, as a Senior Practitioner Sounding Board will be established, composed of leading figures in peace negotiations, among them the divisional heads of the mediation support elements of the relevant international organisations. The Sounding Board will be able to help shape the format of the practice-oriented outputs and offer advice on individual substantive issues where they have special competence. The project has been formally endorsed by the UN and the PI has been in constant interaction with the UN Mediation Support Unit of the Department of Political Affairs, which is eager to cooperate and utilise the project outputs. Contact has also been established with the AU, where there is interest in collaboration. Other project partners or beneficiaries include, in particular, the African Sub-regional organisations involved in mediation ventures, the EU Mediation Support Team, and &amp;quot;mediatEUr&amp;quot; (European Forum for International Mediation and Dialogue), which is providing mediation coaching to the EU External Action Service.
Another set of potential &amp;quot;users&amp;quot; are policy-makers at both national and international levels. The project's in-depth study of peace-making can serve to inform policy-makers of successful strategies of mediation and conflict-resolution, contributing towards evidence-based policy-making and bringing vast amounts of additional information to them, thereby facilitating decisions on more effective future policies. There is potential for collaboration with the FCO by organising workshops, so that there can be direct benefit for them from the project.
The project can also help increase public awareness and understanding of the complex world of peace-making, as the project outputs will be easily accessible for everyone.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>680579</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Organization of American States (OAS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Organization of American States (OAS)</gtr:description><gtr:id>D2A19DE2-89A6-46AE-AB4D-CC53F99C4110</gtr:id><gtr:impact>-</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>In addition to the participation of Jean Michel Arrighi (Secretary of Legal Affairs at the OAS) in the Practitioner Advisory Board, the project enjoys the support of the General Secretariat of the OAS, which enables the project to rely on the organization's extensive experience on peace negotiations and peace agreements when researching the various substantive issues that arise in such agreements.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The OAS has long been involved in various peace processes and the conclusion of peace agreements, and the outputs of the research project (through analysis of the region's practice, as well as though making the OAS aware of other possible solutions put forward in conflicts beyond the region) will further aid the work of the organization in this respect, both on a theoretical and practical level.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>United Nations (UN)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the UN Mediation Support Unit</gtr:description><gtr:id>F6394932-B890-429F-95B9-A466FE10DEA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Up to this point, the main outcome that has been assisted by this collaboration is the creation of the peace agreement database that is currently being completed.

The provisions of these agreements are tagged according to the issue(s) they address, ranging from ceasefire arrangements to human rights; there are 26 main issue areas in total, with each of them including several sub-issues. In its final form, the database will be searchable for these (sub-)issues, as well as many other factors, such as date, language and type of conflict.

The database is currently being finalized; the initial data entry of the peace agreements (which had to be carried out manually) has been completed. Regarding agreements which are readily available in English, the focus is now on importing the tags from the MS Word documents used during the initial phase of the project (the use of which was mentioned in the 'Data Management Plan' of the research proposal), as well as carrying out any manual additions or corrections to the import process. The project also covers a significant number of non-English-language agreements; these nearly 200 agreements have also been entered into the database (in the original language), translated (for the internal use of the project, as these are not official translations), and are currently waiting to be tagged. As new agreements become available, they are also tagged and added to the database, in order to ensure that it remains up-to-date. Once the database is finalized, it will be made publicly available online.

Update 2017 reporting period:

The import of tags and additional tagging has been completed, and further agreements have been added to the database as they have become available; the database now matches the collection of the UN Peacemaker database. The team also added further information to the database, allowing users to (1) search for particular parties and witnesses of agreements, including non-state actors and international organizations; (2) access the full text of agreements via a web link; (3) see which agreements are related to the one at hand and access the full text of those related agreements via web links; (4) see if the text of an agreement in the database is in the original language or other publicly available translation (as mentioned before, internal translations carried out for the project were not made public due to their unofficial nature). Working with the project's IT consultants, further functionality was added to the database - including the possibility of word search and of bookmarking and exporting provisions in PDF or MS Word format as needed - as well as a user-friendly interface, incorporating the comments received from members of the academic and practitioner advisory boards at the workshop in May 2016, as well as the UN MSU throughout the year. The database was publicly launched under the name &amp;quot;Language of Peace&amp;quot; on 6 December 2016 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York (see the 'Engagement Activities' section for details of the launch event).

In sum, the &amp;quot;Language of Peace&amp;quot; database includes around 1,000 peace agreements, with the provisions of each agreement categorized according to the issues they address. Users can browse these issues; carry out a word search; filter agreements based on conflict type, region, language, date range, country/territory, or parties/witnesses; bookmark and export provisions; view related agreements and access the full text of the agreement at hand as well as those related. The browse, search and filter functions can also be used in combination with each other. &amp;quot;Language of Peace&amp;quot; complements and builds on the UN Peacemaker database, which hosts full text documents of such agreements.</gtr:description><gtr:id>36C8E66C-7E0D-46CB-B851-F8C4596519F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development of the issue-based tagging system and its application to the collection of peace agreements has enabled the research team to gain a clear overview of the provisions addressing a certain issue within peace agreements. This, in turn, allows deeper analysis to be carried out: the MS Word documents (mentioned above) form the source materials for the case studies prepared by the research team, with the role of these documents taken over by the online database, once the latter is finalized.
