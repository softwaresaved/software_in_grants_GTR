The research aimed to understand how classical turbulence is modified in a superfluid, in which flow is severely restricted by quantum conditions associated with the quantization of angular momentum. 

Experimental studies of a high quality oscillating grid in superfluid He-4 in the limit of very low temperatures revealed a regime near 10 mK where measurements at intermediate driving forces yielded results that were erratic, hysteretic, and history-dependent. Qualitatively similar effects had been seen with an earlier grid, again involving two critical velocities, and an attempt to explain them was made in terms of the behaviour of remanent vorticity. Pinned vortices and the flow of superfluid around them will influence the effective mass of the grid, and hence its resonant frequency. The sudden jumps observed during frequency sweeps suggests the co-operative movement of many pinned vortices together. The history-dependence may relate to the number and positions of the vortices. At higher temperatures, depinning will occur more easily, assisted by thermal fluctuations. 

We also measured critical velocities for quartz tuning forks oscillating in vacuum and in the superfluid and used Michelson interferometry to establish the absolute values of the fork prong velocity needed for onset of the turbulent state.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results need to be taken on board by anyone planning experiments on oscillating structures in superfluids.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CFB4E749-C674-4F75-8D4A-356D86B0B427</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4A431BD5-DEB5-405F-B5F4-939DE00B2E4B"><gtr:id>4A431BD5-DEB5-405F-B5F4-939DE00B2E4B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Direct Measurement of the Critical Velocity Above&amp;nbsp;Which&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;Tuning Fork Generates Turbulence in&amp;nbsp;Superfluid Helium</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Low Temperature Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4ee8b990f2b731507f1440ff6fc41082"><gtr:id>4ee8b990f2b731507f1440ff6fc41082</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Efimov V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F6E21B04-1CDE-481A-A4E6-6F94FAB48810"><gtr:id>F6E21B04-1CDE-481A-A4E6-6F94FAB48810</gtr:id><gtr:title>Behavior of quartz forks oscillating in isotopically pure4He in theT?0 limit</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/847d2bf292c1b74ec13b7b28cd32fe83"><gtr:id>847d2bf292c1b74ec13b7b28cd32fe83</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Garg D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A0F988DE-2D4A-41F9-8AB2-1F45F466FB81"><gtr:id>A0F988DE-2D4A-41F9-8AB2-1F45F466FB81</gtr:id><gtr:title>Frequency-dependent drag from quantum turbulence produced by quartz tuning forks in superfluidHe4</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/999ddd6c876da9587576200eb7cf98ab"><gtr:id>999ddd6c876da9587576200eb7cf98ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ahlstrom S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AD0E9A4C-4D8C-4ED1-A813-8B31D9DA6280"><gtr:id>AD0E9A4C-4D8C-4ED1-A813-8B31D9DA6280</gtr:id><gtr:title>Initial studies of a linear motor for generating quantum turbulence in He-II with a drawn grid</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Physics: Conference Series</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1b1eaa7532abfc47b7a50b88b6635995"><gtr:id>1b1eaa7532abfc47b7a50b88b6635995</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Giltrow M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/66F0E103-13F3-4CB2-B694-7015589A544E"><gtr:id>66F0E103-13F3-4CB2-B694-7015589A544E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experiments on a High Quality Grid Oscillating in&amp;nbsp;Superfluid 4He at Very Low Temperatures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Low Temperature Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4ee8b990f2b731507f1440ff6fc41082"><gtr:id>4ee8b990f2b731507f1440ff6fc41082</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Efimov V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/D067758/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97B14C81-E082-430E-BC8F-733274083163</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Supercond, magn. &amp;quant.fluids</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A3511416-4477-494C-B6DC-0B92BFD2ECBA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Quantum Fluids &amp; Solids</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
