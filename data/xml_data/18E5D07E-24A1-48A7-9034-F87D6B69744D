This ability has lead to a number of scientific breakthroughs both in the life and physical sciences. Significant advances in general optics have frequently been achieved by the desire to image samples with increasing resolution so that the finest structures can be resolved. Indeed just over 130 years ago Abbe advanced the study of optics with his work on improved optical microscopy with the introduction of diffraction theory and the study of optical aberrations. However, crucial to all forms of microscopy is the ability to have contrast between the different structures present within the sample. For most of the last fifty years this has been provided by the addition of fluorescent labels to the sample culminating in the use of genetically modified samples so that they naturally express a fluorescent label. Even in this case the sample is not in its natural state and thus the method is not practical for a number of samples, and makes the application of microscopy to living tissue difficult, and impossible for many clinical applications.Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy is a method by which optical microscopy can be undertaken using the spectral fingerprint of a specific molecule as the contrast agent. By tuning two laser sources to the correct wavelengths specific molecular spectral features can be excited enabling highly specific microscopy. The process is non-linear and hence the imaging volume is restricted in three dimensions offering the ability of the microscope to naturally generate high resolution optical slices which can be reconstructed to produce three dimensional images.However, as one wishes to image more deeply into a sample the laser light has to pass through the sample and is aberrated leading to a loss of signal and spatial resolution at depths much beyond 100microns. This problem is similar to that faced by ground based astronomers examining space through the atmosphere. Through the use of active optical elements (adaptive optics) they have demonstrated that the atmospheric aberrations can be removed, or at least minimised. Previously we have adopted the same technology to multiphoton and confocal microscopy with considerable success; however, both of these imaging modalities require the addition of fluorescent compounds to the sample in some form thus perturbing the natural state of the tissue. The aim of this project is to explore the use of adaptive optics (AO) in CARS microscopy by linking, for two weeks, world leading expertise in both the application of adaptive optics to microscopy and CARS imaging. By fitting the Institute of Photonics AO system to the Harvard CARS microscope we will rapidly be able to determine if AO has a role to play in CARS microscopy as is strongly suspected. This proposal thus offers a rapid, low cost route to the evaluation of AO for in-depth CARS microscopy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5644</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Harvard University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Harvard link on AO In CARS Microscopy</gtr:description><gtr:id>1BCF9A56-FB23-4F08-985C-EA239D9399E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several papers and publications as well as a patent listed elsewhere</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Harvard brought the CARS microscopy skills, we brought the adaptive optics</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have developed a patent on the research undertaken</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>506510</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Responsive Mode</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/I010173/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>E0586CB4-20CD-4DFC-B84F-B7524B336F2E</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>American Patent Submission December 2007</gtr:description><gtr:id>8C5279D9-1C7F-4F08-A5DD-C17799708385</gtr:id><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:protection>Patent granted</gtr:protection><gtr:title>System and Method for Employing Adaptive Optics to Provide Enhanced Signals in CARS Microscopy</gtr:title></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project demonstrated that adaptive optics can be integrated into CARS microscopes and improve but the depth and resolution of CARS microscopy. Beyond the science the short but focused visit also demonstrated a very practical and efficient way that science can be undertaken between labs through an initial two day focused planning visit (by the PI) and then a two week laboratory visit by the two post docs who had worked on the method in the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The use of CARS is being considered for medical diagnosis and hence the increased depth and resolution offered by the AO route may have a longer term role to play. The work was published in peer reviewed journals and also in several conference proceedings and has since been included in two book chapters by the PI.

A patent was filed and discussions are taking place with Olympus and Leica who have the non-exclusive rights from the Harvard group to sell CARS microscopes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3B7FCC3D-58DD-4DD7-B8AA-ADC9994A4AA7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3BD3D44F-9BC9-4E5B-9BC9-C43E251CBA7F"><gtr:id>3BD3D44F-9BC9-4E5B-9BC9-C43E251CBA7F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adaptive optics for enhanced signal intensity in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optics Express</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c485c452108a332bf89a8b507153ad71"><gtr:id>c485c452108a332bf89a8b507153ad71</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> A Wright</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DD72EE62-32CA-4AB2-B674-F3EC9B7CFD76"><gtr:id>DD72EE62-32CA-4AB2-B674-F3EC9B7CFD76</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adaptive optics applied to coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Multiphoton Microscopy in the Biomedical Sciences VIII.</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e862976bd0d17d10374c181555e177c1"><gtr:id>e862976bd0d17d10374c181555e177c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> John Girkin (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B9447806-FDC0-4CBC-BF1D-4FA52AF1CE92"><gtr:id>B9447806-FDC0-4CBC-BF1D-4FA52AF1CE92</gtr:id><gtr:title>Application of Adaptive Optics in CARS Microscopy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1fef87eb030f71ed6ae5b75a5dc3e815"><gtr:id>1fef87eb030f71ed6ae5b75a5dc3e815</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>S Poland</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F020155/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9CD2DA3B-F052-4076-95ED-10F46E76C382</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Optics, photonics &amp; lasers</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3730AA1C-F09A-4945-8874-DEF6237C50CD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Lasers &amp; Optics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
