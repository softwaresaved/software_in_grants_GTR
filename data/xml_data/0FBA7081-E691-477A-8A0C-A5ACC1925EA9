project as it develops to ensure a robust evidence base. It will also react to employer needs for research and seek to
develop more of a culture of research amongst the employers. It will produce short articles and provide an advisory role
which includes:
An analysis of existing research focused on solving skills problems through use of data
Access to current research on skills data
Production of written outputs to engage stakeholders in the research
Providing academic rigour to the user requirements (use cases) particularly from a training perspective
Expert advice with collaborative frameworks and scenario definitions
Thought leadership on the use of open data around skills to help solve problems
Leadership on dissemination, support for events, access to relevant networks, etc
Support on project sustainability and policy context</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries are employers, training and education providers and finally policy makers/Government. Policy
makers are key as they will help ensure the ongoing impact of the work and its sustainability through making policy which
supports the approach rather than puts further barriers in the way. We will develop an approach which recognises the
difficult financial context for many public sector policy makers and the importance of our research supporting the drive for
efficiencies.

How will they benefit?
The project will increase employment by matching skills to need, support the provision of relevant training to meet employer
need and reduce migrant labour thereby recycling more wages back into the local economy. In combination this will
improve the economic situation of areas as well as improve opportunities for individuals in terms of accessing employment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50038</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>SkillsPlanner is a collaborative and data-powered approach to addressing the construction industry skills shortage. The long-term aim is that SkillsPlanner will enable the construction industry, known for its fragmented approach to skills planning, to become more collaborative, connected and efficient. Plymouth University has a remit to ensure that the SkillsPlanner consortium are aware of new developments and policy announcements in the skills arena. To this end, the team has produced a number of intelligence briefings about key developments in the construction sector which are publically available on the SkillsPlanner website. Three have been produced to date, December 2015, May 2016 and October 2016. By outlining the key issues affecting the demand and supply of skills within the construction sector the December 2015 document provides an economic context and justification for the investment in SkillsPlanner. The more recent briefings provided an outline of key policy developments and considers their implication for both SkillsPlanner and the sector as a whole. 
The research team also has an objective to regularly engage with a range of stakeholder groups (including training providers, employers, brokerage services, and local authorities) to gather, for example, views on emerging impact (economic and social) and suggestions for improvement to operational performance. To date, the team has conducted 18 baseline consultations with members of the steering group between January-April 2016 and follow up consultations during October and November 2016. The significance of this formative research is that it has enabled the central SkillsPlanner team to shape activity going forward, ultimately maximising the societal and economic impact of the intervention. The consultation programme has also engaged with local authority members of the SkillsPlanner steering group, therefore also leading to impact on policy and public services. Finally, of relevance to this subsection, the research team are also collecting monitoring data and outputs at regular intervals to assess project performance. This will ensure that the impact (both emerging and final) can be clearly articulated and evidenced.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7687C0E7-90AA-4C19-A1C6-A90D7F88E4CE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N01118X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
