Predicted conditions and adaptive plant traits for the northern Mediterranean Basin are also applicable to the southern, non-European side and will be relevant to Stakeholders representing farmers from that region. The phenotypic responses of a tailored barley germplasm diversity set that is relevant to resilience, sustainability, and quality will be determined under anticipated conditions of altered water and nutrients, CO2, and pathogen pressure. The set will include cultivated barley, landraces from key European production regions differing in aridity and pre-figuring climate change effects, and wild barley from the Fertile Crescent, which represents the gene pool from which domestication occurred and also carries resilience adaptations. These responses will be connected to genes and genome regions by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using extensive sequence variant, epigenome, and transcript abundance datasets, and by ecogeographic analysis. The genetic and genomic data sets will be leveraged from earlier (barley 9K SNP set; exome capture) and ongoing (WHEALBI exome capture) studies, which will serve to define the germplasm included in WP1, and will be complemented by planned ClimBar studies (ChIP, small RNA). Therefore, a very large amount of mostly transcribed sequence information will be available to declare and use polymorphisms with a density of coverage and representativeness of germplasm exceeding all previous efforts in this species. Plant phenotyping will be carried out under field conditions within regions expected to experience differing climate change scenarios, and under controlled greenhouse conditions where detailed physiological phenotypes will be collected. Genes and landraces and CWR associated with environmental conditions will be identified by ecogeographic analysis of genetic diversity. Based on observed plant responses and predicted climate scenarios, proposals for genomic selection (GS) and ideotype models for 2070 will be developed, and relevance to interim conditions assessed. Collaborative interactions with agro-economic modellers as well as climatic modellers will set up to estimate harvests in 2070 and their impact on the agro-economy, based on data collected within ClimBar</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In ClimBar the phenotypic responses of a tailored barley germplasm diversity set that is relevant to resilience, sustainability, and quality will be determined under anticipated conditions of altered water and nutrients, CO2, and pathogen pressure.

This fundamental shift, largely driven by some participants in this project who have developed technologies that make the former essentially facile, provides the rationale behind the strategy adopted in ClimBar and generates considerable opportunities that are relevant to Food, Agriculture, Environment and Climate Change science. To maximise impact, ClimBar will focus on addressing the phenotype and, by utilising germplasm collections and advances in genotyping made in existing national and international projects, will deliver to each of the food, feed, beverage, milling, farming IT and biotech sectors. The vehicle by which this will be Achieved will be the plant breeding community. By effective characterization and use of the diversity present in ancient barley landraces and wild relatives, and by exploring predictive plant breeding focused on low inputs and climate change coupled with modelling impacts on production, ClimBar will provide the germplasm, tools and information help deliver climate-proofed cereals tailored to our changing environment</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296321</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0170279F-C765-4926-B0AC-67C0B376E03F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Open day at the botanic gardenss with displays, activities, demonstrations etc.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Fascination of Plants and Family Fun Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>45BEB158-2DE0-4542-8243-966DAD6A0EDD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>EPSO's Fascination of Plants day in Dundee is combined with an event called Family fun day that we run annually at the Botanic Gardens.

We have also seen that some Leaf wax mutants lose water very quickly while others apparently do the opposite. Looking at a collection of over 80 independent mutants has shown us that the genetic control of wax deposition is tissue specific and developmentally controlled. We have initiated a number of material exchanges where the reaction of different mutants will be thoroughly assessed for growth in drought, elevated CO2, high Ozone conditions and their reaction to a number of barley pathogens. We are close to identifying the genetic lesion responsible for a dominant spike wax variant found at relatively high frequency in wild populations from the near east fertile crescent. A paper describing our results is currently in preparation. We have made the observation that several of the wax mutants affect the adherence of the hull to the grain and are developing the hypothesis that allelic variation at one or more of these loci may be involved in the recently emerged problem of skinning that reduces barley quality destined for malting.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope to identify genes and markers for plant wax composition that may be important for breeding for adaptation to climate change

In addition - while not directly related to the CLIMBAR grant application objectives we have observed that a small number of the barley waxless mutants exhibit poor hull adherence resulting in a 'skinning' phenotype on harvest. This is a particularly interesting observation because skinning has become a major quality issue with UK barley destined for the malt house for use in brewing. This observation gives an unique route to unravel the genetics of this complex trait. Our hypothesis is that plant wax or cutin defects that are apparent in the waxless mutants are somehow involved in the process of 'cementing' the hull to the developing seeds. This may provide two avenues for further investigation - one in relation to solving the skinning problem and 2. in developing alternative 'semi-naked' (or easily pearled) barleys for the human consumption.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F54ED5C7-66C1-478B-9BC0-1D22655D3916</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M018466/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE2D53CC-F199-452E-A1FE-B63F4222D636</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant responses to environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A6E5CEB-ACA3-4301-98AD-C7EC310948FD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theoretical biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
