Since then noncommutative operator algebras have become a powerful tool in the analysis of singular topological spaces and measure spaces (such as leaf spaces of foliations or orbit spaces of ergodic group actions) with links and applications to many areas of mathematical and theoretical physics, eg K theory, the Novikov conjecture, foliations, link and 3-manifold invariants, quantum groups, modular invariants, topological and conformal field theory, and D-branes. 

With the introduction by Connes of noncommutative geometry, and with it noncommutative models of space-time, entirely new avenues of research have opened up. Noncommutative tori, through their K theory, have been used to provide matrix models in quantum field theory. The subfactor theory of Jones led to connections with link and 3-manifold invariants, quantum groups, exactly solvable models in statistical mechanics, conformal quantum field theory and modular invariants. 

This programme actually links these two areas - utilising the realisation of the Verlinde ring by Freed-Hopkins-Teleman FHT as twisted equivariant K-theory, and the realisation by Wassermann et al of the Verlinde ring as endomorphisms or bimodules of loop group subfactors. 

Ed Witten predicted that a theme of 21st century mathematics will be mathematicians coming to terms with quantum field theory, which is the language physicists believe describes fundamental physics. The nontrivial quantum field theories which are the simplest and most symmetrical, and so are the most amenable to mathematical study, should be the so-called conformal field theories CFT in 2 space-time dimensions. These CFTs are themselves of direct interest in physics, most famously because their study is equivalent to that of perturbative string theory. Applying the Wightman axioms to CFT leads very directly to the definition of a vertex operator algebra VOA first formulated by Borcherds. A VOA can be regarded as a mathematically rigorous algebraic formulation of the most symmetric of the quantum field theories.
 
All known CFTs are the results of straightforward constructions applied to standard examples. But the classification of subfactors leads to candidates for exotic CFTs. Part of our project is to explore these possibilities. 

Atiyah tells us that an n-dimensional topological field theory associates numbers to closed n-manifolds and vector spaces to closed n-1 dimensional manifolds. For n=3, the space associated to a torus comes with a ring structure - the Verlinde ring. Atiyah's definition can be extended, by attaching a linear category to closed n-2 dimensional manifolds; for n=3, the circle is associated to a modular tensor category capturing eg. the braid group and modular group representations. A natural framework for FHT's K-theoretic interpretation of the Verlinde ring is dimensional reduction, a standard way to go from an n-dimensional topological field theory to say an n-1 dimensional one (with more symmetry); applied to n=3 and the circle, it yields the Verlinde ring. Some analogue of all this should apply to any CFT, and exploring this is part of our proposal. FHT only consider a chiral half of the CFT; the two chiral halves splice together in nontrivial ways, and the resulting full CFT is very rich mathematically - see eg the work of Evans and collaborators for a braided subfactor approach, or eg Fuchs et al for categorical interpretation, of the full CFT. Much of our project is to fill this gap, and understand how FHT extends to the full CFT. In this sense we are trying to uncover the basic structure of the simplest nontrivial quantum field theories.

This project sets out to explain and construct CFT's, including exotic models beyond finite and loop group data, using tools from subfactors, twisted K-theory an VOA's.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is in basic research and therefore the primary beneficiaries of the research are within the academic research community with no imminent direct critical pathway towards economic and societal impact. However the project does have links with academic disciplines outside pure mathematics in mathematical and theoretical physics which we explain. The role of the visiting fellow is to bring in expertise to the UK where it is currently under represented.

This project is set in pure mathematics - being a blend of affine Lie algebras, vertex operator algebras (VOAs),
vector valued modular forms, operator algebras, C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras, K-theory, Kasparov KK-theory and
addressing problems arising in quantum field theory, particularly rational conformal field theory (RCFT).

Gannon will bring world-class expertise to the UK in RCFT, in particular its modular side: eg. the classification of modular invariants, the structure (eg. Galois) of modular data and its realisation by modular forms, and relations to Moonshine and
VOAs. This expertise in the number theoretic and algebraic sides of CFT is currently lacking in the UK, and is particularly
appropriate for the proposed programme, where it complements nicely the expertise of Evans. In particular, the programme to naturally develop the K-theoretic theme of Freed-Hopkins-Teleman within CFT requires an intimate knowledge of modular invariants, nimreps, modular data, D-brane charges etc of the CFTs related to loop groups and finite groups (as well of course as an intimate knowledge of the theory of full systems, alpha-induction etc developed by Evans and collaborators). Gannon brought Galois methods into CFT which have been taken up particularly by Asaeda in subfactor classification first and more recently by Calgieri, Morrison and Snyder. One aspect of this programme is to bring this expertise to the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47862</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>160000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Newton Institute Programme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>758ACB8B-8E4F-47DE-B921-5D050D8FBE24</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A subfactor encodes the symmetry of a quantum system - a statistical mechanical model or at the critical temperature - a conformal quantum field theory. It was thought that exotic models could be produced by this machinery beyond the usual models which had underlying classical symmetries. However producing such models proved elusive. In 1993 Uffe Haagerup produced a candidate for an exotic subfactor of irrational dimension (5 plus the square root of 13)/2 , by essentially producing the Boltzmann weights at criticality by his bare hands.

However Evans and Gannon have shown that one can understand this subfactor from classical symmetries of an elementary finite group and the group of orthogonal transformations in 13 dimensions, producing evidence for an underlying conformal quantum field theory. We also provided evidence that the Haagerup family belongs to an infinite family and most recently with this EPSRC award found another related series, with underlying conformal field theories based on underlying classical symmetries. We provided many new examples of subfactors, which put the Haagerup subfactor and some related generalisations of Izumi in two potentially infinite series of subfactors of near group quadratic systems. More significantly we showed that the modular data of the corresponding Drinfeld doubles were completely natural and related to non-exotic data obtained by grafting of modular data from dihedral groups, loop groups in the first series and quadratic forms on abelian groups in the second. 

We realised nonunitary fusion categories and computed their quantum doubles and modular data, with endomorphism realisations of the (nonunitary) Yang-Lee model, and nonunitary analogues of one of the even subsystems of the Haagerup subfactor and of the Grossman-Snyder system on the polynomial Leavitt subalgebra of the Cuntz algebra. This analysis also shed light on some unresolved mysteries in our earlier unitary settings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work will be of interest to workers in subfactor theory, conformal field theory, and categorical approach to conformal field theory in providing many new examples for analysis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A09DA21E-D12F-4D06-AC40-7B4C6D3C128B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03546</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C77F0449-701F-4444-923F-F33D8BE31DE9"><gtr:id>C77F0449-701F-4444-923F-F33D8BE31DE9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Near-group fusion categories and their doubles</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7e02a907747d385859de5a8346fba086"><gtr:id>7e02a907747d385859de5a8346fba086</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8D01758E-5544-427F-9983-A804A54881E3"><gtr:id>8D01758E-5544-427F-9983-A804A54881E3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Non-unitary fusion categories and their doubles via endomorphisms</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7e02a907747d385859de5a8346fba086"><gtr:id>7e02a907747d385859de5a8346fba086</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F79357F0-F747-4B48-ACCB-F8D437A4807E"><gtr:id>F79357F0-F747-4B48-ACCB-F8D437A4807E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modular Invariants and Twisted Equivariant K-theory III: KK-theory</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>to be submitted in April 2016 after careful proofreading</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6c8af803cc899e986f5fb73a700f3a06"><gtr:id>6c8af803cc899e986f5fb73a700f3a06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans DE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J003352/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
