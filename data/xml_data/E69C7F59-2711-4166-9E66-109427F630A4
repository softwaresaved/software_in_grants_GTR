However, there little evidence regarding what design features aid website use, and advice on the subject is conflicting. The question this study seeks to determine how web-mediated information can be optimally presented and organised for this cohort.&lt;br />&lt;br />The study will involve website usability testing with people with LD, comparing various designs and focusing on different attributes (text size, layout and navigation). Tasks will be suitable for undertaking by people with low literacy skills, involving only one action. &lt;br />&lt;br />?Trade-off? techniques will be employed to analyse the data ? a tool of market research never before exploited in this context. They will both determine which attributes of a site have the greatest impact on performance, and provide a relative weighting to the importance of each. The findings will provide a rich picture of how information for people with LD may be best presented electronically.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Apart from the academic beneficiaries of the research, as outlined elsewhere in this proposal, the main beneficiaries will be those with learning disabilities. The direct benefits they will accrue are:
-An optimum interface to use which will better facilitate information access and retrieval;
-Appropriate and accessible information on e.g. leisure activities; supported employment etc.;
-The prestige of working on the project as active participants rather than simply as research 'subjects'.

Indirect benefits include:
-Being more visible on the research agenda;
-Working in an environment where their tutors are more aware of the impact of different web interfaces on performance.

Others who would benefit in the longer term from the project are discussed below, along with a brief outline of how they might benefit:
-Parents and carers: These individuals should gain a better understanding of web behaviour and how web design can help promote effective usage
-Web developers: Formal web accessibility guidelines have been criticised for not taking into account learning disabilities (Seeman, 2006). In a study of how people with LD could be active participants in web design Helen Kennedy and colleagues (Kennedy et al, 2009) found that web developers had little awareness of intellectual disability, or of accessibility needs. The report authors were quick to point out that one reason for this ignorance was the lack of appropriate guidelines or leadership from W3G (The World Wide Web Consortium) and other web standards. This research may benefit web developers by highlighting the issues and providing suitable templates. 
-Charities and the voluntary sector: The Rix Centre (a registered charity) based at the University of East London will directly benefit in that their web developers will be able to use the project results as noted above. Other charities, dealing on a day-to-day basis, will benefit in that they will have access to informational materials and - more importantly, as the project length precludes more than an exemplar set of these - be more aware of how to 'package' their own material online. 
-People with other conditions (and their carers): One key attribute of this project is that the methods may be applied to other groups, such as elderly people or dyslexics. Both of these groups may require tailored design features (see e.g. Hanson, 2001 regarding elderly use and Al-Wabil et al, 2007 with respect to dyslexia) and so might benefit from better presented information over the longer term.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75286</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Festival of the Arts: Something Else for the Weekend UCL research exhibition/festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F1A2A3D7-6B4D-441D-B2FF-70F9C8B85D9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a week long festival taking place between 7th and 12th May. The festival broadly aims to highlight the value of Arts and Humanities to the wider world (and UCL's substantial contribution to this), while taking the opportunity to fundraise for much needed bursaries within relevant disciplines at UCL. My study will be featured. I will have a stand with a poster and printed booklets (the latter for people to take away), plus a hands-on computer activity where people with undertake web information finding tasks on a computer. The writing will be deliberately changed to simulate reading with a low level of literacy. Participants will describe their experiences and compare them with research results.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academnic audiences (collaborators, peers etc)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4F4F523F-67AC-4658-86C9-46F5E9FB667E"><gtr:id>4F4F523F-67AC-4658-86C9-46F5E9FB667E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparing The Effectiveness Of Different Website Designs In Facilitating Information Retrieval For People With Learning Disabilities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/13bd050a209e35a5d7e776789305131e"><gtr:id>13bd050a209e35a5d7e776789305131e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>peter williams (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C64828D1-3DEF-4B11-BA84-1A30BA089BD2"><gtr:id>C64828D1-3DEF-4B11-BA84-1A30BA089BD2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Eliciting web site preferences of people with learning disabilities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/13bd050a209e35a5d7e776789305131e"><gtr:id>13bd050a209e35a5d7e776789305131e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>peter williams (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/16E899BD-A467-41D2-8768-49297AE92F41"><gtr:id>16E899BD-A467-41D2-8768-49297AE92F41</gtr:id><gtr:title>Eliciting web site preferences of people with learning disabilities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b5ab7be8a661f40c0b034900fa5213a1"><gtr:id>b5ab7be8a661f40c0b034900fa5213a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J004286/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
