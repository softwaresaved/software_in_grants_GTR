The solution of the time independent Schrodinger equation will allow us to obtain the equilibrium geometry of a molecule or an ensemble of molecules, and to calculate the potential energy for any position of atoms and electrons in the system. This approach will give us the potential energy of interacting molecules as a function of their geometry. Comparison of this energy for interacting individual C and H atoms and molecules with the interaction energy calculated by the conventional MD approach (taking into account the internal degrees of freedom of molecules, used in our current EPSRC project EP/H001603/1) for the same inter-atomic distances will allow us to analyse the differences in the QM and classical potentials. It is anticipated that our results will be used to calculate the corrections for the potentials used in the classical MD calculations. The new hybrid model will be used for the analysis of the dynamics of n-dodecane molecules in liquid and gas phases and at the liquid/gas interface, using techniques developed during the work on EPSRC project EP/H001603/1. It is anticipated that at this stage we will be able to establish the range of applicability of the conventional MD approach. A new approximate method of taking into account the QM corrections to the classical results will be developed. Also, the previously developed kinetic model, taking into account the presence of two components (fuel vapour and air) in the kinetic region will be generalised to take into account the presence of the three components (two species of fuel and one of air) there. These new models will be applied to the analysis of Diesel fuel droplet heating and evaporation in realistic engine conditions. In contrast to the previously developed models, the kinetic effects will be taken into account alongside the effects of temperature gradient and recirculation inside droplets and the effects of the moving boundary during the evaporation process. We are not aware of any previous research in this area.

This will be a collaborative project involving visiting researchers Professor Vladimir M. Gun'ko (Chuiko Institute of Surface Chemistry of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine) who is an internationally recognised expert in interfacial phenomena, Dr Bing-Yang Cao (Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.R. China), whose expertise includes the development of numerical algorithms for molecular dynamics simulation and Dr Irina Shishkova (Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Russia), whose expertise is focused on the development of numerical codes for the solution of the Boltzmann equation. It will be led by Professor Sergei Sazhin, whose expertise includes the development of new physical models of fuel droplet heating and evaporation with a view of applications to modelling the processes in internal combustion engines. The Co-investigator Professor Morgan Heikal will advise the project members on the relevance of the models to automotive applications. A Research Fellow will also be included in the project. This project will build upon the currently funded EPSRC project EP/H001603/1, supporting the collaboration between the PI, Dr B-Y. Cao and Dr I. Shishkova, and previously funded EPSRC projects EP/C527089/1 and EP/E02243X/1, and a Royal Society Joint project with Russia, supporting the collaboration between the PI and Dr I. Shishkova.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is expected that outside of the academic research community the main beneficiaries of this research will be mainly the automotive industry via the industrial partner, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. The modellers of the processes in internal combustion engines will be able to use more accurate models for droplet heating and evaporation, which will lead to more reliable predictions of the models. The project's results will be reported at 10th Euromech Fluid Mechanics Conference and the 14th International Heat Transfer Conference, which alongside academics attract many representatives from industry, including the automotive industry.
The project is expected to directly benefit the designers of fuel injection systems through an increased understanding of droplet heating and evaporation mechanisms. Importantly, further understanding of the compromise between the requirements of a direct fuel injection system, that can optimally satisfy both homogeneous and stratified charge operation, whilst simultaneously minimising engine emissions, will be incrementally advanced. It is expected that some of the results will be directly applicable to the modelling of other spray phenomena (e.g. aerosol sprays in medicine or agriculture).
 The results will be disseminated to a wider audience through publication on the Sir Harry Ricardo Laboratories (SHRL) website and the University of Brighton open access repository. This will allow the general public to familiarise themselves with the state of the art developments in this field. A specific website for the project will be set up.
 All three Visiting Researchers, Professor Vlad Gun'ko, Dr Bing-Yang Cao and Dr Irina Shishkova, are expected to have direct contact with Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd and the wider engineering and environmental community via their work at the Sir Harry Ricardo Laboratories. It is likely that their involvement in the project will contribute to the creation of links between the British, Ukrainian, Chinese and Russian academic and industrial communities. A collaboration agreement between the Sir Harry Ricardo Laboratories and the Visiting Researchers' home institutions, Chuiko Institute of Surface Chemistry, Tsinghua University and Moscow Power Engineering Institute, will be prepared in due course if the project is funded by the EPSRC. 
It is expected that the Research Fellow working on this project will be primarily involved in all impact activities, with strong support from the Principal Investigator, Co-investigator and the Visiting Researchers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>335056</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ricardo UK Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ricardo UK Ltd</gtr:description><gtr:id>5D2F1E25-6322-429E-8CA6-0ECC373597E1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See our publications</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Ricardo consulted us regarding the relevance of the models to automotive applications</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We developed a model which can be potentially used in automotive applications</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our developments allowed us to provide rigorous justification of previously developed Molecular Dynamics (MD) models, not taking into account quantum-chemical effects.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DAAC4E91-822D-4089-9FB8-B68FE752EA9A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Energy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. The collision processes between n-dodecane (approximation of Diesel fuel) molecules and clusters/nanodrops/microdrops were investigated for the first time based on the Dynamic Reaction Coordinate (DRC) method, taking into account quantum-chemical effects. The probability of the attacking molecule sticking to a droplet was shown to be maximal if the molecular plane was parallel or almost parallel to the droplet surface. In the case of microdrops, individual C12 molecules were predicted to evaporate from their surfaces, while in the case of clusters and nanodrops they were predicted to disintegrate into clusters and individual molecules.
2. The decrease in the likelihood of evaporation/condensation with temperature, predicted by the quantum-chemical (QC) approach, agrees with the prediction of the classical theory based on the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of n-dodecane molecules. The evaporation/condensation coefficient of n-dodecane molecules using the transition state theory (TST), based on the QC/DFT approach and taking into account the conformerisation of n-dodecane molecules, was estimated. It was shown that taking into account the QC effects leads to marginal modifications of the predicted evaporation/condensation coefficient, particularly at temperatures which are not close to the critical temperature.
3. A new algorithm for the solution of the system of three Boltzmann equations for three components in a gas mixture was developed. Binary collisions between molecules are taken into account assuming that these collisions are elastic or inelastic. The functionality testing of the algorithm is performed using a simple test problem of heat and mass transfer in the mixture of n-dodecane, p-dipropylbenzene (approximation of Diesel fuel) and nitrogen between two infinite parallel walls. It was concluded that the predictions of the new kinetic algorithm are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of more basic models of the phenomena. This model was applied to the analysis of droplet heating and evaporation in Diesel engine-like conditions. The kinetic effects were shown to increase with increasing gas temperature and molar fraction of p-dipropylbenzene.
4. A new kinetic self-consistent model for heating and evaporation of Diesel fuel droplets is suggested. The effects of finite liquid thermal conductivity and liquid species diffusivity and inelastic collisions in the kinetic region were taken into account. Diesel fuel was approximated by n-dodecane or a mixture of 80% n-dodecane and 20% p-dipropylbenzene. The values of temperature and vapour density at the outer boundary of the kinetic region were inferred from the requirement that both heat flux and mass flux of vapour (or vapour components) in the kinetic and hydrodynamic regions in the vicinity of the interface between these regions should be equal. This was achieved by performing an iteration process. The kinetic effects on the droplet evaporation time were shown to increase with increasing gas temperatures in agreement with the previously developed models.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The quantum-chemical effects are shown not to affect in a significant way the values of the evaporation/condensation coefficient, previously obtained using the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. This can allow researchers in this field to ignore quantum-chemical effects in the analysis of this parameter unless very high accuracy of calculations is required. The newly developed self-consistent kinetic model is recommended for the analysis of droplet heating and evaporation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6275CE32-2E70-448C-868F-5AA6779D5107</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Energy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/667B9401-3D2E-48E7-A5BC-9F72D5AB6582"><gtr:id>667B9401-3D2E-48E7-A5BC-9F72D5AB6582</gtr:id><gtr:title>Processes in the vicinity of the surfaces of individual droplets</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle> International Conference 'Fluxes and Structures in Fluids - 2013', St Petersburg, June 25-28, MAKS Press, Moscow, Eds.
