With flood damage estimated to be above &amp;pound;3billion/event (based on 2007 flooding events) and an average house claim of &amp;pound;40k, flood mitigation and damage assessment are a priority in the Governmental agenda. Current methodologies rely on the use of satellite data (SAR or optical) or aerial imagery collected from aircraft. However, several limitations within the underlying technology curtail the current effectiveness of the strategy: (i) optical imagery cannot provide information under low-cloud cover presence and (ii) satellite (SAR) data, which can penetrate cloud cover, is challenging in urban areas due to its oblique viewing angle and the difficulty of separating the water signature from other urban features. Hence, at present, we do not have sufficient data to robustly calculate flood impact in urban areas. 

Small-scale Vertical Take Off (VTO) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a key engineering tool for future environmental monitoring tasks. Within the context of flood extent mapping and damage estimation, UAV aerial imagery offers both timely (on-demand) and increasingly detailed (higher resolution) information than comparable satellite or aircraft imagery. Here, we contribute to address the gap in the provision of immediate post-event flood extent and visible damage information by coupling knowledge from four core research areas:- (i) emerging technologies (Dr. Rivas Casado), (ii) flood engineering (Dr. Butler and Dr. Yu), (iii) remote sensing (Dr. Johnson) and (iv) catastrophe modelling (Dr. Irvine).

The objectives are achieved via six consecutive steps that integrate the four core disciplines mentioned.
Step 1 (O1). UAV data will be collected to obtain a representation of the flooded area at fine resolution. This will require site selection, flight design andata acquisition. Independent frames will be mosaicked together to produce an accurate orthoimage of the area of interest (maximising resolution).

Step 2. Satellite imagery will be collected for the area of interest to generate an additional layer of information (maximising coverage). The FloodMap model will be used to map flood extent using the digital elevation model generated from the UAV imagery. As far as possible, in limited time, existing damage data matching the selected event will be sought from Oasis or Ambiental partners.

Step 3. The data sets from (1) and (2) will be integrated in a Geographical System Information (GIS) environment (maximising modelling efficiency).

Step 4. Key parameters informing on flood extent will be extracted from (3) using established approaches. Outputs will be validated via ground truth data (if flooding occurs). In a flood constraint scenario, a comparison between flood derived parameters from UAV and satellite imagery will be provided (maximising modelling robustness).

Step 5. Key to the overall success of the project is a strong focus on the correct understanding of the market requirements. For this purpose, a small-scale, exploratory market definition will be undertaken to gather the type of products different end user communities will require to visualise and successfully use the integrated product (maximising product uptake).

Step 6. Step 6 will deliver the proof of concept through the integration of results from (4) and (5). A service definition will be provided to conceptualise the product the end user requires. At this stage, the service definition and integrated outcome should align to guarantee further allocation of funding resources on a cost-efficient tool for rapid assessment of damage from floods and storms that increases the accuracy in estimates of insurance loss and has the potential to enable the validation of insurance claims.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal (and follow ups) will aim to facilitate maximal impact over a number of key themes:- industrial, societal and academic.

Impact to industry and society: The project has been designed from the outset to consider the information needs of the user communities detailed in the beneficiaries section. In particular, Step 5 of the project involves a market analysis to further engage with user communities to understand what information they currently lack, what information would help them respond more efficiently and rapidly and via what mechanism they would want to receive this information. The project team will draw heavily on its existing expertise and contacts through the OASIS+ project (Innovation of the year Industry award 2014) and potentially through the project's commercial partner, Ambiental, to engage with these communities. 

The service definition activity (Step 6) will by its very nature involve feeding back to the user communities to demonstrate the proof of concept and seek their views on the potential service offering. It will also provide a clear opportunity to take their views on board in identifying further research needs and shaping the next stage of service development. 

The impact of the project has far wider reach than the user communities identified above and will impact significantly on the general public. Making sure that insurance claims are handled rapidly and accurately will make a significant real world impact on the lives of those whose homes and businesses have been flooded. It will also help utilities companies to continue providing services to the public with reduced outages. Hence, not only does the proposed service support significant economic benefits in terms of reduced costs or improved efficiencies for insurance companies, as well as for utilities companies and local authorities but it supports significant social and societal good to the general population living in flood risk areas.

Academic Impact: In the short term, cross-collaboration between team members will enable the development of new ideas for the submission of future RCUK, Innovate UK and Horizon 2020 proposals. It will also consolidate collaboration with industry (Ambiental) and open pathways to further enable the transfer of knowledge between industry and academia. The 3 month project will help establish a closer link with the Catapult Satellite Applications and help Ambiental explore commercialization routes through different industry partners. This proof of concept project is sufficiently novel for the results to be published in high impact journals. All publications will be available open access through golden route. In the long term and as a result of follow up proposals, outcomes will be presented at key national and international conferences. The multidisciplinary nature of the project will enable the reporting of both individual state-of-the art advances relevant to each discipline and key advances across-disciplines. This will contribute to consolidate the PI and Co-Is track records with NERC.
 
The project aligns to the priorities of the space innovation and growth strategy, especially on the &amp;quot;use of climate and environmental monitoring from Space facility (CEMS) to process and merge streams into climate quality and other required data sets&amp;quot; and contributes to &amp;quot;assess the validity and integrity of observations, data and products&amp;quot;. In addition, it aligns with the research priorities and specific challenges highlighted by the Roadmap for Climate Services (i.e. growing the climate services market and demonstrating the added value). The cross-disciplinary approach to service provision links to cross-council initiatives such as the &amp;quot;Living with Environmental Change&amp;quot; theme (&amp;quot;Coastal and waterway engineering&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Water engineering&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sustainable land management&amp;quot;) targeting flood understanding, monitoring and defence.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19959</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90C3ABE2-57E6-4F31-8E00-7B034301E0FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 15 min presentation on the use of drones for flood extent mapping and damage assessment.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/brim/brim-workshops/sustainable-and-resilient-water-infrastructure-flood-risk-and-resilience/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>How Climate Change Impacts Flood Risk - Post Event Summary</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>02E91E47-DE1A-49DB-BD7C-B35C80896207</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 15 min presentation summarising project methodology and outcomes.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-climate-change-impacts-flood-risk-post-event-summary-joe-thomas</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Worcester university- Small Unmanned Aerial Systems for Environmental Research</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DAF1E290-2B1D-4F4F-9BB2-EFAF0FDF7E3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A short presentation (20 min) summarising project methodology and outputs.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.worcester.ac.uk/discover/uav-conference.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at British Hydrological Society conference at Cranfield University// hydrologists make the water go round</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>540717EE-EC90-4A74-A3B3-71339F662702</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 20 minute presentation sunmmarising the potential of UAVs for flood extent mapping and damage assessment.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.hydrology.org.uk/dms-files.php?id=1123&amp;action=doc</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of the work at NERC event- reporting project outputs</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B5EAC94-07E2-4127-9D90-F25EBC90203C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A short presentation summarising project methodology and outputs.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings are being used to set UAV operation practice for emergency situation (flood events) by insurance companies, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Environment Agency.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4BE0226A-BFBD-497F-AB55-A8E8668C4E39</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The flood peak was missed by the Sentinel-1 satellite overpass and only a partial image of the west of Cockermouth was acquired on the 06/12/15 @20:51. The satellite imagery failed to provide an estimate of flood extent within the urban area. The integration of the array of data sets collected provided added value to the already existing Sentinel- 1 imagery. Based on the point damage database derived from the high resolution aerial imagery, there is evidence to believe that model outputs for both Ambiental Ltd. and Willis Watson Towers underestimated the extent of the damage. Particularly, estimates from water surface flood. All insurance claims could be validated from the damage event dataset generated from the high resolution aerial imagery.

Overall, the market analysis proved that there is a need to expand the framework developed under this project to other catastrophes (tornadoes, wind storms, nuclear events, earthquakes and hail). Within the context of flood extent mapping, data should be provided within 24h-48h with updates every 24h for up to 10 days after the event depending on its magnitude. These requirements are expected to be more relaxed for other catastrophe events (e.g. earthquake or wind storms). Data provision preferences highlighted the need for accurate images and event data shapefiles (flood extent, damage points) with resolution requirements of 10cm to 20cm for extent mapping and finer than 10cm for infrastructure damage detection.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The climate services presented during the interview were classed as the &amp;quot;most accurate and reliable in the market&amp;quot; by several companies. All companies highlighted the need for a tool that enables the automated identification of damage from high resolution aerial imagery and its fast root to commercialisation via the OASIS+ programme. The market definition study also highlighted the need for: (i) tools that allow effective and accurate estimation of debris and rubble volume (e.g. landslip), (ii) products that enable vertical water depth estimation to an accuracy of 10cm and (iii) techniques for the estimation of building damage (e.g. roof or facade cracks), (iv) accurate data sets that enable the validation of current flood extent and damage models, (v) risk communication products (as per 3D visualisation films) and (vi) provision of flood extent and damage uncertainty estimates.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>98CEE05E-7478-4C2A-B462-9C791DF58E46</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N020316/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F63617E9-02B7-41EA-AD68-B2D597237394</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Informatics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4504C6B4-D825-4F14-B0D3-7931AC636B71</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Remote Sensing &amp; Earth Obs.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98C0D11F-5C27-40CE-A895-54E4C61784B1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technol. for Environ.
