However, even as we know the precise nature of components of matter and how they interact with each other, there is still a lot of room for surprises. It turns out that when many particles interact with each other, they often display genuinely new and different behaviour. In this sense, the old saying that the whole is more than just the sum of its parts turns out to be true!

In this proposal, we investigate the consequences of interacting many-particle systems in a setting that is particularly conducive to observing strong quantum effects. One frequently exploited route for enhancing quantum effects is the application of strong magnetic fields: in this setting, the kinetic energy of particles becomes unimportant, and all of the physics is driven by the interactions. This is the foundation of the fractional quantum Hall effect, which is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon observed when electrons are confined in a thin layer of material pierced by a very strong magnetic field.

Surprisingly, it turns out that the effect of the magnetic field can be emulated spontaneously by certain types of materials that have recently been discovered, including strained graphene, or possibly thin films of materials involving heavy elements like iridium. Furthermore, the fields generated by such materials can be 10 - 100 times higher than magnetic fields which can otherwise be experimentally generated in the laboratory. Still, there is a twist to this story: the direction of the synthetic magnetic fields generated in these materials depends on the orientation of the spin, i.e., the axis around which individual electrons turn.

The combination of strong magnetic fields, along with the added complexity of the opposite field directions for opposite spins leads to the new area that will be investigated in our project. Naively, this is a very difficult task, however, as the numerical methods that are usually used for this purpose are overwhelmed when the extra spin degree of freedom is included. In addition to new opportunities from materials physics, we will thus exploit another timely development and adopt a new way of looking at many-body quantum systems by characterising the respective wave functions from a quantum information point of view. Rather than giving the wave function globally for the entire system, we will use an efficient approach to encode how individual degrees of freedom depend on those of their immediate neighbours. In more technical terms, we describe the system in terms of its entanglement properties, where entanglement quantifies to which extent the quantum state of a particle at a given location is conditional on the quantum states of other particles in the system.

By establishing an effective means of simulating the complex many-body physics of our target systems, we achieve predictive power over the resulting collective behaviour. Typically, we expect that this behaviour is very sensitive to the system parameters. Hence, the ability to effectively simulate the behaviour numerically provides a tremendous advantage in finding physically interesting regimes. We will use this ability in order to identify types of materials in which the desired quantum effects are most robust. We will also go beyond understanding what happens in a stationary regime, when the system is left to relax to its absolute ground state. We can learn even more about the intricate interplay of the constituent particles by exposing our system to a rapid change in parameters, and studying how it evolves afterwards. Think of taking a hammer and listening to the resulting sound of a bell when it is being struck in different places. Clearly, this is a lot more informative than just looking at the bell left to its own devices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will establish density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) as a new tool for investigating fractional topological insulators found in interacting 2D quantum systems with time-reversal symmetric realisations of artificial gauge fields. Owing to the pioneering aspect of the work in exploring this new area, our research has the potential to generate insights which will provide guidance for a broader range of topics. Just like the fractional quantum Hall effect has taken a role as the first seam in the goldmine of topological phases, fractional topological insulators are well placed to take a similar role in the investigation of the broader class of symmetry protected topological phases. Our investigation will provide a microscopic understanding of FTI that will be useful to the community working on an understanding of this physics, including many theoretical physics groups, for example nationally at Oxford, Leeds and St. Andrews, as well as internationally at UC St Barbara, Princeton, MIT, Berkeley, Dresden, and the Perimeter Institute.

We will explore DMRG methods to analyse dynamical phenomena in the quantum Hall regime, opening up applications to related questions of non-equilibrium dynamics in topological phases more generally. This is a timely research area, and will feed into the national EPSRC focus area of Emergence and Physics Far from Equilibrium. In particular, our FTI system yields examples with multiple edge channels, providing a laboratory for observing the combination of interactions and non-equilibrium features. Based on our analyses of these settings, we aim to provide new insights relevant to current experimental work on fractional quantum Hall edge channels, pursued in experimental groups such as those of C. Marcus (NBI Copenhagen), F. Pierre (CNRS, Marcoussis), or M. Heiblum (Weizmann Institute).

The project will also address the modelling of realistic 2D materials supporting fractional topological insulators. Beneficiaries will include experimental groups working on related implementations, such as strained graphene or other two-dimensional materials (National Graphene Institute/Manchester), or the possibility to include elements with strong spin-orbit coupling into thin films, which might be grown at UK institutions in Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial, or Leeds, among others; strong overseas institutions include the Centre for Emergent Matter Science at RIKEN, Japan. Target groups for the analysis of 2D strongly correlated materials include S. Langridge/ISIS, Y. Chen/Oxford or P. King/St Andrews. Our results also apply to cold atoms experiments emulating suitable Hamiltonians, as studied in groups of U. Schneider/Cambridge, T. Esslinger/ETH Z&amp;uuml;rich or I. Bloch/Munich. We will communicate directly with these groups in the course of the project.

Within the School of Physical Sciences at Kent, this grant will help to build critical mass for a theoretical condensed matter group, in addition to two PDRAs currently being hired in the groups of Dr Quintanilla and Dr M&amp;ouml;ller. The topics of this grant provide opportunities to investigate possible materials realisations of FTI, building on the combined expertise in theory, chemical synthesis and materials growth &amp;amp; characterisation in the Functional Materials Group. In particular, the group has strong expertise on metal-organic frameworks, which have also been suggested as potential candidate materials hosting FTI.

At a practical level, the project will establish a new collaboration between the hosting institution at Canterbury and our external project partner Dr Pollmann currently at the Max-Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, and moving to the Technische Universit&amp;auml;t M&amp;uuml;nchen in the course of the project. The exchange of the PDRA between these two groups will provide additional training opportunities for the PDRA, and will help disseminate know-how on numerical algorithms and the physics of topological phases between our groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101003</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P022995/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97B14C81-E082-430E-BC8F-733274083163</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Supercond, magn. &amp;quant.fluids</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A2FF150-B3DF-4C8F-A44C-1EBF60BAFC60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Condensed Matter Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
