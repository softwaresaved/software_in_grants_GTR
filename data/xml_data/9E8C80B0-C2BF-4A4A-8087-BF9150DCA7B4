However, this research also raises more general issues about how we decide between conflicting interpretations of literary texts: can we choose between competing readings of literary works on some rational grounds or is literary criticism, in effect, merely a matter of personal opinion? These issues are particularly central to the interpretation of Chaucer's work since it has been said that there is less critical agreement about what Chaucer was trying to achieve than for any other major writer in the canon of English literature. Traditionally, critics have tended to interpret literature as somehow timeless in its concerns and thus as able to speak to us across the ages about the 'human condition'. Instead of interpreting Chaucer as the product of a society whose culture was profoundly alien to our own, this 'humanist' criticism emphasised the accessibility of Chaucer's meaning for modern readers. Such assumptions are now likely to seem extremely dated to modern scholars who, under the influence of new historicist, cultural materialist and feminist literary theory, often prefer to emphasise the 'alterity' of medieval culture and to see writers such as Chaucer not as timeless but rather as engaging with the specific social, political and religious conflicts of their own day.Yet, ironically, despite this historical turn in literary studies, modern critics have often implicitly retained very traditional assumptions about the ability of works of literature, or at least of 'Great Literature', to transcend the limitations of the dominant ideology of its day. Pearsall, for instance, contrasts the work of lesser medieval poets, in which the official world-view of the day is imposed onto the poetry, with that of Chaucer, in which meaning emerges organically from the literary narrative: Chaucer's fiction is not simply the vehicle for an external truth, rather his fiction is the meaning; his form is the content. Similarly Wallace has criticised those who see Chaucer's poetry as the medium for discourses derived from outside (for instance, from contemporary religious or political thought) and who thus mechanically subject Chaucer's text to a 'pre-fashioned theoretical grid, thereby squeezing the spontaneous intelligence from the poetry'. This approach has been especially popular with those critics who, under the influence of Bakhtinian literary theory, see works of literature as sites of ideological conflict and for whom Chaucer's works, with their diverse social voices and competing outlooks, posed a challenge to the ideal of social harmony propagated by the dominant ideology of the day.This research will examine two issues which have an immediate relevance to these debates about how Chaucer's work relates to its historical context. The first is the role of external authority in Chaucer's poetry, which will be explored through the case-study of the political philosophy of Giles of Rome in relation to Chaucer's 'Knight's Tale'. The second is the significance of Chaucer's choice of literary form, in this case his use of multiple voices in the 'Canterbury Tales', for the reception of his work by his contemporaries and, in particular, how this reception may have been influenced by the medieval concept of 'Opinion'. My aim is to show that what often seems radical or subversive to modern readers could have a very different meaning for medieval audiences. Thus, whilst literary form is certainly crucial for how we interpret the meaning of a text, literary form is itself historically specific in its significance: textual and contextual approaches must always go hand in hand in our interpretation of Chaucer's work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29435</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D000335/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
