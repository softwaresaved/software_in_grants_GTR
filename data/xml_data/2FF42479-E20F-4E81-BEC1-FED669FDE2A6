limit</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/K015834/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Super-resolved microscopy (SRM) represents a revolution in optical imaging with profound implications for the life sciences. It allows researchers to visualise biological structure and function on almost the molecular scale in live cells and organisms. Typically biological processes are visualised by attaching fluorescent molecules to proteins of interest forming images from the light emitted by these fluorescent &amp;quot;labels&amp;quot;. The optical resolution, which defines the smallest structures that can be visualised, has long been regarded as fundamentally limited to &amp;gt;200 nm by the diffraction of light waves. Recent breakthroughs in fluorescence microscopy, however, have exploited the ability to systematically switch the emission of fluorescent molecules on and off in order to break the &amp;quot;diffraction limit&amp;quot; and achieve resolutions down to 10's of nm - almost the scale of the typical biological proteins that are involved in signalling processes that determine the fate of cells and organisms and so are essential to disease processes. 

This project builds on the partnership between the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre (CSC) and Imperial College London to develop a range of SRM instruments to advance our understanding of epigenetics, regulation of genes and cells, immunology and metabolism by resolving fundamental biological mechanisms inside the nucleus, inside live cells and at the synapses of interacting cells. It also aims to establish super-resolved microscopy as a widely accessible tool for the research community at the CSC and Imperial. 

The first SRM technique would be structured illumination microscopy (SIM) that entails illuminating samples with patterns of light and observing the interference patterns between these patterns and the structure of the sample. This effectively doubles the resolution of a normal microscope. The second approach is an advance on laser scanning confocal microscopy, in which as sample is imaged by scanning a focused laser beam across a sample and collecting the fluorescence pixel by pixel through a pinhole that blocks out of focus or scattered light. The size of this focussed laser beam spot defines the resolution of this microscope. By using a second, collinear, specially shaped laser beam that is scanned synchronously and can switch off the fluorescence from molecules around the outside of the first beam focus, the fluorescence excitation is restricted to a smaller spot than the diffraction limit and thus resolutions below 50 nm can be realised. Because this technique can block scattered or out of focus light, it is particularly suitable for imaging in live organisms. The third SRM modality relies on having only a small fraction of the fluorescent labels being switched on at any time such that they can be treated like arrays of single molecules. Their individual positions can be determined by locating the centres of the &amp;quot;blobs&amp;quot; that represent each molecule in an image - which is possible to a precision of a few nm. By sequentially switching on different subsets of the fluorescent labels and determining their individual positions, one can build up a super-resolved &amp;quot;image&amp;quot; that is simply the map of the locations of all the fluorescent molecules.

In this proposal, we will develop and apply these new imaging techniques to visualise biological structures and processes that are simply too small or inaccessible for conventional microscopes. Starting at the surface of cells, researchers will be able to observe how immune cells communicate and nerve cells interact with each other, and how tumour cells relate to normal cells. Looking inside cells, we will visualise signals that communicate the energy status of cells and how the genome is organised. It will be possible to resolve how chromosomes behave in developing germ cells, which is relevant to the most frequent causes of infertility and birth defects. The research will deliver new insights into both normal biological processes and disease states.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This partnership aims to combine strengths in basic science underlying human disease and imaging technology to develop capabilities in super-resolution microscopy (SRM) in order to study fundamental biological mechanisms inside cell nuclei, inside live cells and at the synapses of interacting cells. 
Initially we would establish a commercial SIM microscope to provide rapid SRM of cells with existing labels. This would enable users to rapidly gain expertise in SRM, e.g. through studies of chromatin organisation and reprogramming of lymphocytes by ES cells. We would also implement rapid FLIM FRET, e.g. for directly correlation of SRM of changes in subcellular structure with cell signalling. 
In parallel the Photonics team would extend their 3-D STED microscopy to live cells with GFP and YFP and also implement RESOLFT using, e.g. rsGFP. This will utilise novel fibre-laser based excitation/depletion/switching lasers developed in-house, as well as SLM technology for beam shaping and adaptive optical correction of aberrations. A key application would be to image synapses between live cells - noting that these can lie in arbitrary planes not readily accessible to other SRM techniques. Progressing to intravital imaging, we would also develop a STED/RESOLFT microscope for to study the formation and function of neurological synapses in live in mice. 
We would also upgrade our in-house developed TIRF-based PALM/STORM systems to live cell imaging using emerging algorithms to separate signals from closely packed fluorophores and implement 3-D PALM/STORM using, e.g. axial localisation and oblique light sheet illumination. We would then replicate this system in the CSC for studies of nuclear reorganisation during meiosis in C. Elegans and for other subnuclear imaging applications. 
The in-house development of SRM technology makes it cost effective and inherently upgradeable, enabling it to be sustained at the cutting edge for multiuser access beyond the project's end.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This significant project would have impact derived from the new technology to be developed and from the novel biology to be addressed. It would have a major impact on the CSC and Imperial College through the establishment of SRM and its development to functionality beyond the state of the art. As the partnership develops, the benefits of this project will extend beyond the initial group of investigators, with &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; SRM technologies becoming embedded as multiuser facilities within the well-established FILM in South Kensington and within the microscopy facility at the CSC on the Hammersmith site. We would also explore the possibility of becoming a node of the ESFRI Euro-BioImaging (EuBI) initiative, which would provide another avenue for broader dissemination of our technology. Thus this project would &amp;quot;raise consciousness&amp;quot; about SRM and the new opportunities it presents and highlight expertise in its application throughout Imperial and beyond. 
The technology and software tools that we propose to develop and integrate could be applied by others for SRM and related microscopy techniques. They are also likely to find diverse applications in a range of optical instrumentation. With respect to technology development, the Photonics Group has a strong track record of interacting with industry particularly for fluorescence imaging techniques and for translating novel fibre based scientific laser source concepts into technologically attractive and commercially viable prototypes. A particular example of this are the high power all-fibre-based visible light sources providing pulsed radiation with variable repetition rate and picosecond pulse durations that can find application in a wide range of instrumentation besides SRM, including, e.g. wide-field and laser scanning confocal microscopes, FLIM systems, time-resolved fluorometers, flow cytometers and displays. The SLM techniques for aberration correction could also find application in diverse optical instruments including for imaging and metrology and the software tools to be developed could be applied in, or adapted to, other contexts. We would make software tools publically available, probably via the OME platform, once they are robust. The programme is also likely to deliver a range of novel labels and probes for SRM in different systems. As we publish and disseminate our work, these probes will be made available to the scientific community and will therefore become a resource for future research.
The biological components of the proposal cover a range of areas that are important for health and disease, including immune and neurological synapse formation and function, cancer biology, lymphocyte reprogramming and chromatin reorganisation. While our research is primarily aimed at making fundamental insights into the biology of these systems, both in normal cells/ tissues and following genetic or pharmacological manipulation, the use of SRM would provide a level of detail for structures such as neurological and immune synapses that has never before been possible and this may have longer term implications for the understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of new therapeutics. Combining functional insights from FRET and FLIM with structural insights from SRM for the first time could bridge the resolution gap between biochemistry and imaging, potentially providing a step change in our understanding of structure/ function relationships in these important systems and helping us better understand both normal and disease states. Thus the immediate impact would be to the academic research community but in the longer term the project could stimulate the development of new therapies.
The knowledge and skills gained by the staff working on this project would directly benefit them in terms of increasing their potential for research impact and future employment and could benefit the biophotonics instrumentation and biomedical research communities who could employ them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1973211</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Clinical Sciences Centre (CSC)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Imperial College - MRC</gtr:description><gtr:id>2FBA955C-E938-4ACF-8E64-CEA256640275</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enhanced collaboration and publication.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaboration.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Enhancing collaboration between Imperial College London and the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London (ICL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Imperial College - MRC</gtr:description><gtr:id>0BA83CE9-5F67-4EDE-BA8D-7B4BE426351E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enhanced collaboration and publication.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaboration.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Enhancing collaboration between Imperial College London and the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Biophotonics Summer School Hven 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>96BEB846-D4CA-4DE7-A368-FAAC466A35B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I lectured on the Biophotonics Summer School organised in Hven, Sweden every two years.

It is to be noted that it is an advantage of the present invention that de novo Foxp3 expression is being induced. This is contrasted with the situation in the prior art where the best effect shown to date has been the expansion of T cells which are already expressing Foxp3. The opportunity to actively induce Foxp3 expression in cells which are not currently expressing it is a significant advantage of the present invention.
We show that small molecule inhibitors of the PI3K/mTOR pathway rapidly and efficiently induce the de novo expression of Foxp3, the signature transcription factor of the Treg cell lineage. This enables new therapeutic approaches to be applied to clinical settings where the de novo generation of Treg cells is desirable, such as the prevention and the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Many of these diseases are of major clinical significance, such as rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetes.

For example, we have used the SIM system to investigate how WAPL, a protein that regulates the association of cohesin with chromosomes, affects the removal of different cohesin complexes during meiosis. 
We continue to use the SIM and STED systems to investigate how different protein complexes modulate the structure of meiotic chromosomes, and we are also aiming to develop protocols to implement PALM and STORM, which should provide better resolution that SIM or STED, to visualize meiotic chromosomes.

FLIM may be used to read out protein interactions and biosensors reporting cell signalling events using F&amp;ouml;rster resonant energy transfer (FRET) and also to read out changes in cell metabolism via autofluorescence from NAD(P)H and/or flavoproteins. This instrument will therefore enable cell signalling processes or metabolic changes to be correlated with morphological information below the resolution of standard confocal or wide-field microscopes. The FLIM modality is controlled by &amp;micro;Manager open source software and the FLIM data analysis is undertaken using FLIMfit, our open source client for OMERO.</gtr:description><gtr:id>06E35ACA-24C2-4AD2-8F80-BE5DF55A1A85</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We intend to initially use this for studying signalling processes associated with the cell cycle, for which the super resolution of the SIM will provide complementary information to the fluorescence lifetime images. The FLIM capabilities will be more widely applied to utilise FRET biosensors.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>New SIM FLIM microscope platform</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved Technique/Technology</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a new approach to localisation microscopy (PALM/STORM) and to TIRF that is more robust and significantly lower cost than standard instruments. Essentially we have demonstrated that we can realise TIRF and STORM using multimode fibres, which greatly relaxes the optical alignment tolerances and the efficiency with which the excitation radiation is coupled to the sample. This enables TIRF and STORM to be realised with much cheaper excitation lasers, including multimode broad-stripe diode lasers. Our simplest &amp;quot;easySTORM&amp;quot; configuration can utilise a &amp;pound;30 laser diode and provide STORM images with sub-50 nm resolution. To make this technique more widely accessible, we have also implemented simpler sample preparation protocols based on Vectashield rather than more complex buffers. We have also written the control and data acquisition software in the open source &amp;micro;Manager software and used open source localisation software (mainly Thunderstorm) for analysis. We have also developed software tools to enable the localisation and the visualisation steps in the data processing to be separated. We are also extending the functionality of this instrument to 3-D STORM.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3C3E9CC2-7731-4943-91CF-061EF3FB5306</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We intend to use this new technology to make SRM significantly cheaper and more widely available. This could be useful for researchers in less affluent environments (e.g., developing countries) and could also make personal SRM cost effective. Our implementation can be added to any upright microscope with only ~&amp;pound;20,000 of components, for which we intend to make a parts list publically available. We will also share our software provided once we can implement our approach on a microscope, where we do not take advantage of any proprietary information for the control of the microscope. In terms of biological goals, we are working to develop a robust approach for parallel SRM of actin and tubulin, which we want to image at the immunological synapse. We will also build a second PALM/STORM microscope for the FILM facility in the South Kensington campus.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>New PALM/STORM microscope platform</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved Technique/Technology</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>We have developed an implementation of the data analysis pipeline for STORM microscopy to run on an HPC cluster and specifically have adapted it to run on a 4 x 24 node cluster that we believe provides a cost-effective solution for processing of the large datasets associated with STORM microscopy. Specifically we have implemented ThunderSTORM to run on Java on the HPC cluster and have divided the localisation tasks between the four nodes. We are working to accelerate other parts of the workflow, taking advantage of the parallel processing of HPC.</gtr:description><gtr:id>670EB5C0-1253-4623-89A2-5E6AF4D2F98D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This HPC STORM platform gave us a ~10x speed improvement over our normal laboratory computer. In effect, this reduces the time from hours to minutes and so helps us refine our experiments and improve our protocols.

We have also worked to develop an instrument for STED of GFP-labelled samples, for which we have demonstrated a novel ultrafast fibre laser to be used as the STED depletion laser. This offers advantages in terms of cost compared to current approaches based on Ti:Sapphire lasers and optical parametric amplifiers and provides pulsed depletion, which is an advantage compared to existing c.w. fibre lasers that are often used for STED microscopy.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EBE918C3-0925-4E3D-BEB5-27CB8401B51F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We intend to implement the new fibre laser in the GFP STED microscope. We choose to target GFP, rather than YFP, which is used in commercial STED microscopes) because we ultimately aim to realise SRM in vivo in mouse or to apply STED ex vivo to transgenic mouse tissue. Currently most mouse models present GFP. We are also working towards a STED microscope optimised for td:TomatoFP, which is also increasingly used in transgenic mice. We have been applying our existing Ti:Sapphire/supercontinuum based STED microscope to the study of STED using nanoparticles that are designed to work with much lower depletion powers - and therefore could be more suitable for imaging live samples.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>New STED microscope technology</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved
