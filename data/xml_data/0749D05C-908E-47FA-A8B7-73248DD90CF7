The world has evolved in a way that renders Enlightenment certainties insecure. Whether it is Adorno's claim that metaphysics are paralysed after Auschwitz, or Derrida's claim that any ethics participates in something that is still to come, there is a sense that modern ethics are at best radically incomplete. Yet at the same time, we feel the need to ethically judge, and the sense that some things are categorically wrong. There seems a disparity here.

The argument of this book will be that philosophers like Adorno and Derrida have something extremely important to tell us about modern ethical experience despite the somehow counter-intuitive character of their philosophy. To get at the significance of what they have to say involves a set of dialogues in which a philosophical position is built up out of the philosophies of Adorno, Bhaskar, Hegel and Derrida. My argument will be that modern society in the period of the Enlightenment held out the possibility of a world in which the strongest ethical relations between human beings were actual sable, but that the subsequent development of that world suppressed this possibility. The result was an ethical schism between the ideal, which became metaphysical and utopian, and the actual, which became the bread and butter ethics of modernity (for example natural rights or utility). A full sense of humankind's ethical possibilities became 'deferred' in modern history and society.

Yet that 'full sense' remains essential to any ethical judgment in the here and now, and this is the strength of Derrida's claim for an ethics to come. In different ways, a similar ethical way of thinking is to be found in Adorno, in Bhaskar's philosophy of dialectical critical realism, and in Hegel's differing treatments of the Beautiful Soul. Examining these different positions consolidates a view of modern ethical positions as making real yet incomplete claims under modern social conditions.

This argument is developed and then deployed (and thereby confirmed) in consideration of a dispute over the nature of war guilt between Hannah Arendt and Karl Jaspers, where it is shown that both philosophers speak to the lack or failure of ethics in modernity, but Jaspers' account of a widespread sense of 'metaphysical guilt' is shown -when deployed in a way he did not himself anticipate to meet something of the problem both theorists identify. This is in terms of an ethical metaphysics that reaches beyond our everyday moral Experience but is partially expressed in it.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18293</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D500362/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB13D4DA-F283-46AB-8BD6-B86DAEB82726</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Jurisprudence/Legal Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
