Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer in children, adolescents, and youn adults, but is still a rare disease with an annual incidence of 2-3 million/year. The most common primary sites are the distal femur and proximal tibia, and 15-20% of patients have clinically detectable metastases at the time of diagnosis. The outcome for patients with osteosarcoma was poor before the use of effective chemotherapy, with 2-year overall survival in the region of 15-20%. The administration of multi-agent chemotherapy has dramatically improved the outcome. Most current series report 3-year disease-free survival rates of 60-70% following the administration of pre-operative multi-agent chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and continuation of chemotherapy post-operatively. These positive results, however, apply only to young patients with localised extremity tumours, while other patients - which make up at least one third of all affected individuals - have traditionally been excluded from prospective randomised trials. Judging from case series and cumulative analyses, their outcome is still considerably worse, with survival rates in the order of no more than 20-30% for patients with primary metastatic osteosarcomas or osteosarcomas of the axial skeleton.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European and American Osteosarcoma Study Group (EURAMOS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>European Osteosarcoma Group (EOI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>EURAMOS</gtr:description><gtr:id>C26FB984-2C39-46D7-9856-BBD91B8D26FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No primary publications yet.

Primary objectives: 
1. To examine, in a randomised controlled trial, whether the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) to post-operative chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate improves event-free survival for patients with resectable osteosarcoma and a poor histological response to 10 weeks of pre-operative chemotherapy. 
2. To examine, in a randomised controlled trial, whether the addition of interferon-alpha ifn) as maintenance therapy after post-operative chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate improves event-free survival for patients with resectable osteosarcoma and a good histological response to 10 weeks of pre-operative chemotherapy. 

Secondary objectives: 
3. To investigate whether the addition of IE to post-operative therapy for poor responders, and the addition of ifn as maintenance therapy for good responders, leads to an improvement in overall survival, short-term toxicity, long-term toxicity and quality of life. 
4. To investigate whether the addition of IE to post-operative therapy for poor responders, and the addition of ifn as maintenance therapy for good responders, leads to an improvement in event-free and overall survival in patients with localized osteosarcoma at entry. 
5. To investigate whether biological or clinical correlates to histological response and outcome can be identified. 
6. To establish whether this international cooperation in clinical trials for osteosarcoma is feasible. 

The trial is currently in follow-up. Results of the primary analysis (for event-free survival) of the good responders randomisation have been presented but active follow-up continues for the poor responders primary outcome measure and all secondary outcome measures. 

The current principle source of funding for this trial is an MRC Trial Grant.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A2DFEC40-B9A5-4354-803D-2D800FE9CF0D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.
