Grass-based biorefinery initiatives are located in Ireland, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Germany, and the Netherlands. High-sugar perennial rye-grass has the potential to provide an ideal biorefinery feedstock for the production of bio-ethanol and bulk chemicals such as succinates and lactic acid, with other co-product streams such as biocomposite materials and animal feeds manufactured from the fibre fraction. This grass is high yielding (ca.15 tonne dry wt./hectare/year) and is ideally suited to the climatic and soil conditions experienced in the UK. It can grow on marginal land that will not support the growth of cereal crops and hence will not jeopardise future food supplies. It requires low annual inputs, especially when grown with clover as a source of nitrogen, and does not require investment in new equipment for sowing and harvesting. This feedstock is available now and is abundant throughout the UK. From a biorefining perspective, it is highly digestible (4-6% lignin) and has a high water soluble sugar content (up to 40%). It also has the benefit of storing its carbohydrate reserves in the form of the water-soluble sugar, fructan, rather than starch. Unlike starch, which requires treatments with heat, acids and a series of enzymes, for conversion to a fermentable sugar, fructan can be converted through the use of a single enzyme. A grass biorefinery based on ethanol and bulk chemicals as well as biocomposites production alone, however, is unlikely to be economically viable and it is necessary to produce additional high value chemicals from the fructan molecules isolated. This project involves a multidisciplinary team of scientists with complementary skills ranging from plant biology to biochemistry, chemistry and surface and colloid science. It sets out to utilise the diverse range of fructan molecules found in perrential ryegrass, as well as novel molecules created by the action of fructan hydrolysing enzymes on these fructans to produce novel high value chemicals. It will initially identify the optimum rye-grass feedstock for a biorefinery by screening a range of perennial ryegrasses developed at Aberystwyth University that will produce high yields of fructans with specific size and molecular architecture. Novel ultrasound technologies will be investigated to maximise the release of plant sugars from the rye-grass through mechanical rupture of cell walls and to assist in the removal of coloured impurities. The fructans will be separated into different classes according to their molecular size and will then be chemically modified to produce a range of high-value sugar-based polymer and surfactant molecules that can be used in the formulation of a broad range of commercial products including, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, personal care, coatings, etc.. Their role in these products is to aid the dispersion of particles, the emulsification of oils and in the control the rheological behaviour. The global demand for surfactants in 2000 was 19.2 million tonnes with carbohydrate based products accounting for 2.9 million tonnes. The demand for biosurfactants produced from renewable sources is likely to expand rapidly, with increasing pressure to reduce the reliance on petroleum derived products. The contribution of the value of the speciality chemicals produced during the course of the project will be assessed with regards to the economics of a total grass grass biorefinery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal is concerned with the establishment of a sustainable biorefinery based on rye-grass and brings together a team of academics with complementary expertise ranging from plant biology, to biochemistry, chemistry and colloid science. The project exploits perennial ryegrass which produces a diverse range of fructan molecules (branched/linear) varying in composition from 3-90 fructose units with different bond types (beta 2,1 and beta 2,6) that will be chemically modified to produce novel polymers and surfactants. These molecules will be produced either directly or through the action of fructan hydrolysing enzymes (endo and exo). Isolation will include the use of novel ultrasound technologies to aid the release of plant sugars from the rye-grass and removal of coloured impurities. Membrane filtration technologies will be used to fractionate the fructans according to their molecular size. The fructans will then be modified to produce a range of polymers and surfactants that can be used in the formulation of a broad range of products including cosmetics, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, surface coatings etc. Chemical modification will be achieved by reacting the fructans with alkenyl succinic anhydrides and alkyl acyl chlorides under relatively mild aqueous conditions. Maillard -type complexes will be produced with a series of proteins and protein hydrolysates using the enzyme treated-fructans. By choosing fructans of varying chain length it will be possible to produce materials which can perform as wetting agents, emulsifiers and rheological modifiers. The performance of the surfactants will be assessed by measurement of the contact angle and dynamic surface tension while the performance of the polymers will be investigated by measurement of the steady shear viscosity.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Integrated Biorefining Research and Technology (IBTI) Club was set up to promote the development of sustainable biorefineries based on biomass and its Steering Group has members from both Academia and Industry. This proposal is in response to the IBTI Club Second call and addresses all three of the science themes set out namely a) 'optimisation of feedstock composition' by screening for plants with altered fructan chemistry, b) 'integrative bio-processing'by creating new sets of molecules using existing technologies and c) 'enhanced product value' by creating high value chemicals from water soluble sugars. This application represents an integration of academic expertise from plant biology and chemistry disciplines to work on an area of science relevant to industry. It will have major social and economic impact since it involves establishing biorefinery technologies which will lead to the creation of both revenue and jobs in the agricultural sector while supplying a broad range of industries with a new set of unique molecules that are currently produced from oil without jeopardising future food supplies. The resulting discoveries and their commercialisation will have an impact by reducing the dependence on oil and hence reducing greenhouse gas emissions without jeopardising food supplies and also by increasing employment in the 'green supply chain'. The main beneficiaries of this research will be: (1)the members of the IBTI Club through the establishment of a sustainable biorefinery based on rye-grass and the creation of a new set of polymers and surfactants based on biodegradable fructans that can be commercially exploited. (2)the academics involved in the project through the development new knowledge and subsequent dissemination in the scientific and/or patent literature. (3)the staff directly employed on the project through specialist training and acquisition of project management, communication and high-level technical skills. (4)the UK agricultural sector through the development of a sustainable crop leading to an increase in revenue and the creation of new jobs (5)the UK Government through the development of processes which reduce the impact of industrialisation on the environment and increase opportunities for the development of the low carbon economy. (6) the UK as a whole by increasing employment in the 'green supply chain' and reducing the dependence on oil and lowering 'green house' emissions. (7)future generations through the mitigation of climate change. AU and BU have existing collaborative interactions in the area of biorefining and are therefore aware of the development of collaborative agreements that includes project management and sharing of IP and BU and GU are currently collaborating on a technology transfer project funded through the Welsh Assembly Government. Once the proposal is approved an appropriate agreement will be put in place between the three Universities and an exploitation plan developed. The primary route to realising the economic impact will be through the IBTI Club industrial partners in recognition of their support for this initiative. The Principal Investigators will be responsible for ensuring that all of the results of the work are published in peer reviewed scientific journals and/or patents and also as popular articles for the wider community. An overview of the project will be included on the websites of the three collaborating Universities and will be regularly updated to include new developments. A Workshop will be organised to apprise the academic and industrial communities of the project and of the biorefinery initiative in general. The Principal Investigators have a strong publication record and considerable experience of technology transfer activities and commercialisation of IP. They have secured funding through EPSRC, BBSRC, DEFRA-Renewable Materials Link, EU, TSB and KTP programmes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>111319</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>330000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Welsh Government A4B programme</gtr:department><gtr:description>Academic Expertise for Business (A4B)</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Welsh Assembly</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>HE06 COL1024</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>5CD530F2-E292-454B-AFFE-26C77BB73A9C</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>INDUSTRIAL COLLABORATIONS
Glyndwr have been in regular contact with Croda throughout the course of the project and have provided samples for testing for potential application in personal care products. Samples of alkenyl succinicate derivatives of fructan have shown good foaming and emulsification properties and further work is being undertaken to optimise their functionality. Aberystwyth University is currently in discussion with a number of companies on the development of a grass biorefinery including the valorisation of co-products. Bangor University are currently discussing the potential applications of grass fibre for composite and pulp moulded product applications.
This project has helped secure funding from BBSRC for a US-UK Partnering Award with the National Energy Research Laboratories Colorado, USA to work on economic modelling of multiple products from grass and has contributed to securing funding for an &amp;pound;800K project 'Sustainable ryegrass products (STARS)' funded through A4B ERDF and Welsh Government with Industrial Partners, and two BBSRC IBTI PhD studentships 'Physicochemical characterisation and chemical/biochemical modification of fructans' and 'Characterisation of the regulatory networks controlling yield and conversion efficiencies in biorefining feedstocks'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AE342B3A-FF54-4012-BBFF-AE947D6B7587</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The economic and sustainable development of a biorefinery is dependent on the valorisation of all co-products and on the maximization of feedstock molecules. Here, fructan (a water soluble storage sugar, produced by temperate grasses) was optimised for use in downstream applications. In this project, high sugar grasses were identified from mapping families and other germplasm that contain the highest proportion of their sugars as polymeric fructan and from these, further plants were identified that contain the highest levels of fructans during late spring, the optimal time of grass harvesting and processing. Genetic studies have implicated fructan synthetic gene copy number as a contributor of this phenotype. A process was developed at pilot scale to isolate these fructans to a high purity, and a further process was developed to convert these fructans to those of specific smaller chain lengths with reducing ends capable of forming complexes with proteins. 
The potential for upgrading the grass fibre co-product as part of a green biorefinery, by removing both colour and odour, was investigated. A combination of physical pretreatment (ultrasound) and an environmentally friendly bleaching agent (sodium percarbonate) was utilised in order to develop procedures for producing colour free, odourless fibre for a range of potential materials applications. Potential applications include, speciality paper and packaging, acoustic insulation and, porosity and vapour composite boards. 
Fructans have been chemically modified to produce biosurfactants for application in a range of commercial formulations notably for the cosmetic and personal care industries. A number of synthetic routes were investigated to attach alkyl chains to the fructans but the most successful method was found to be using alkenyl succinic anhydrides [ASA]. The reaction can be carried out under mild conditions in aqueous solution and hence the materials can be readily produced commercially. Samples were prepared with ASAs of varying chain length and with varying degrees of substitution and the solution properties were studied using surface tensiometry, dynamic light scattering and dye solubilisation. It was found that the samples formed surfactant-like micellar structures in solution above a critical concentration. The research work confirmed that ASA derivatives are able to dissolve hydrophobic compounds and hence have potential application as delivery vehicles for active compounds. The emulsification properties of the ASA derivatives were also investigated. Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared using octenyl [OSA] and dodecenyl [DDSA] succinate derivatives as emulsifier and the droplet size was determined as a function of time and concentration by laser diffraction. Both derivatives were found to be effective at producing stable emulsions with low droplet size and it was noted that DDSA derivatives had superior performance. Their emulsification ability indicates that they have potential for application in the encapsulation of active compounds. 
The economics of producing fructans for comparison with other molecules used as surfactants etc. is very complex and is dependent on the valorisation of other streams from grass. This is currently being modelled in collaboration with the National Energy Research Laboratories (NREL), Colorado USA and other partners, funded through the BBSRC and Welsh Government (A4B).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>From extensive ryegrass germplasm collections at IBERS, plants have been identified with high fructan content particularly during the optimal harvesting period. These plants will be integrated into current breeding programmes. Processes for the purification of grass fructans at pilot scale and for the production of molecules capable of forming Maillard complexes has been developed and will form the basis of a patent application. These processes include the use of membrane systems, ion exchange technologies and readily available inexpensive chemicals currently used in commercial operations, producing fructans with a purity of over 96% (by NMR). The second process involving the use of a specific enzyme for the production of short-chain fructans with reducing groups capable of forming complexes with proteins was developed. Fructans produced by these processes will be sold under licence for a number of applications. Orders have already been received from companies for purified fructan for use in activities outside the scope of this project.
Bleaching protocols have been developed and a number of prototype materials including fibre board composites and paper using bleached fibre have been produced during the project. Initial studies on chemical modification of grass fibre for applications as a potential oil pickup agent were also conducted.
A number of hydrophobically modified fructan derivatives have been prepared by chemical modification using various reagents including alkenyl succinic anhydrides. The micellisation and emulsification properties have been fully assessed in the laboratory and two prototype products have been identified as candidates for potential application as biosurfactants in personal care and cosmetic formulations. These are currently being assessed by Croda Ltd with a view to possible commercialisation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DF60E784-11E2-41F3-B6F3-9917A7331CE6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sugars2products.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/36118503-8711-4A2B-990F-B0C7CB269A86"><gtr:id>36118503-8711-4A2B-990F-B0C7CB269A86</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fructan synthesis, accumulation and polymer traits.
