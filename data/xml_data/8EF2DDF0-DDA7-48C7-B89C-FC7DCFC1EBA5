Court</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M006239/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Suppose that you are a British firm deciding whether, and how, to patent a new technology across Europe. Similar firms, operating in sectors reliant on intellectual property rights, add 4.7 trillion Euros to the European economy annually (http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-889_en.htm). Research has also shown that obtaining a patent is associated with significant growth and productivity improvements on average (Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011). Currently, you have only one option when it comes to patenting across Europe -- the misleadingly named European Patent. This is based on a single patent application, but only takes effect through a `bundle' of national patents in different European countries. This means that you have to pay additional translation and validation fees in each country in which you need protection. Also, you can only defend your patent, or challenge other companies' patents, country by country. 

Soon, you will have a new option: a European Union unitary patent (UP), overseen by a Unified Patent Court (UPC), parts of which will be located in London. Agreement on this unitary patent was only reached after late-night discussions between European Union heads of government, including David Cameron. The agreement has support from the UK's government because the potential economic benefits are large. The European Commission has estimated the cost savings alone at 193 million Euros per year; the knock-on effects due to higher rates of innovation and growth thanks to simpler patenting are potentially larger still. 

These potential benefits are uncertain, not least because many decisions about the new patent system must still be taken. Decisions about patent fees, the rules followed by the UPC, and the quality of the judges deciding patent cases, will affect the attractiveness of the UP and UPC. The new patent system is also being grafted on to an existing European patent system, which may mean the system ends up being more, not less complicated. Current holders of European Patents will have to choose whether to enforce their patents in national courts, or in the UPC. 

Our project therefore looks at the likely benefits of the UP and the UPC -- no easy task, given the complexity of the proposed system, the pre-existing European Patent system, and the patent systems in different European Union member states, and the possible changes in behaviour that result from a new institution. The project brings together researchers from the University of East Anglia with economists and managers at the Intellectual Property Office and specialists at the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law (MPI IC) and the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) to work on research into the existing European patent system. 

We will work on three main areas: the Unitary Patent itself (demand for the patent compared to other alternatives, and opportunities for gaming the system); the Unified Patent Court (the quality of judges on the court, the incentives to litigate, and the volume of litigation); and the ties between small and medium enterprises and national patent offices (in particular, the routes to greater cost-effectiveness for SMEs interested in patenting). 

The questions we ask are informed by our conversations with practitioners at a number of recent events, including a large workshop at the European Patent Office in Munich. Those conversations revealed that substantive knowledge gaps remain about how patenting costs and inefficiencies in existing patent litigation systems affect patent applicants. Many workshop participants expressed fear that large patent active firms would misuse the new patent system to obtain advantages over their rivals. Our project will show whether these fears are well-founded or not, and also establishes an invaluable baseline of patenting activity and patent litigation at the beginning of this new intellectual property regime.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In December 2012 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted two regulations (Regulations (EU) No 1257/2012 and (EU) No 1260/2012) establishing a Unitary Patent (UP) for the EU. In February of 2013 representatives of 25 EU member states signed an Agreement on a Unified Patent Court (UPC). This agreement will enter into force once it is ratified by 13 member states including France, Germany and the UK. These measures represent the most ambitious reform of the European patent regime for at least a generation, affecting innovators, firms, consumers, national courts and national patent offices. The reform has the potential to reinvigorate innovation and growth in the EU. The reform should lower the costs and complexity of patenting in Europe to achieve these aims. The effectiveness of the new patent regime will depend on key parameters such as the costs of renewing a UP, the salaries of the UPC's judges and the procedural rules of the UPC. Research into how users are likely to react to levels of these parameters currently proposed will be highly relevant to the process of completing the reforms.

The proposed project consists of three work packages. These will focus on: i) the UP, ii) the UPC and iii) the role of national patent offices and their interactions with SMEs. Results from research we propose will deliver answers to questions about the way in which the currently on-going reform of the European patent regime is likely to affect i) patent applicants, ii) firms litigating patents and iii) national patent offices and SMEs throughout Europe. These answers will help policy makers and national and EU civil servants in implementing and overseeing this patent reform. 

The most direct impact of the project will be on the Intellectual Property Office of the UK (IPO) as a partner in this project. We have planned three internal knowledge exchange workshops at IPO to transfer methods, information about data and results to the economists working at IPO. IPO are tasked with the evaluation of the European patent reform for the UK government, once the reform has been fully implemented. Much of the work to be undertaken in this project is relevant to laying the academic and practical foundations for this future task. Results from the evaluation will feed back into the process of governance for the new patent regime.

Both the IPO and the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition (MPI IC) have strong reputations for policy relevant research and advisory work. Both organisations have connections to the Economic and Scientific Advisory Board (ESAB) of the European Patent Office (EPO), which regularly provides a forum for users of the European patent system to discuss pressing policy questions. Results from our work will be communicated to this forum quickly. In addition, we will directly interact with policy makers and representatives of the EPO and the UPC through presentations at the workshop planned for the end of the project and at conferences such as the annual European Policy for Intellectual Property (EPIP) conference. We will contribute to specialised blogs such as IPKat and VoxEU that are widely read by policy makers, patent attorneys and judges. 
 
Finally, the project aims to benefit patenting firms in Europe. This has two dimensions. First, research on strategic behaviour within the European patent system is designed to identify patenting behaviour that may reduce the efficiency of the new patent regime and ways to mitigate such behaviour. Second, it is highly likely that in future national patent offices like IPO will focus on interactions with SMEs. Due to SME's lack of resources such interactions are currently inefficient. The project will deliver new methods to improve the effectiveness of the IPO's interactions with SMEs. This work has potential to be replicated at other national patent offices. In these ways the project will also support European industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98996</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Padua</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Economics Department</gtr:department><gtr:description>Visiting PhD Student</gtr:description><gtr:id>9AF12582-0627-4067-8DD9-751E88C3F643</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Firm level data based on the EU Scoreboard.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Sending of the visiting PhD student who is working on data and two papers.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Training of a visiting PhD student.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Commission</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Joint Research Centre (JRC)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Data exchange with JRC - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies</gtr:description><gtr:id>C337FF9E-7D9E-4E65-9ED8-AC7FB9E558ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work on a paper is ongoing.

Abstract: Patent filings have proliferated globally in recent years. While some may see this as a direct consequence of increased innovation, this column uses evidence from the UK to show that patent thickets - patents belonging to many companies protecting overlapping technology - reduce innovation. Patent thickets decrease entry (i.e. first time patenting in an area) by 20%, which is substantial bearing in mind that the average probability of entry into a technology area is only about 1.5%.

 i) research on patenting in Europe
 ii) research on patent litigation in the UK
iii) research on the patent granting process in the UK

Work on themes ii) and iii) was significantly more complex than we had anticipated. Specifically our partner, the IPO UK, were less happy to collaborate with the research proposed under theme iii) and withdrew funding and support for research on theme ii). We are continuing work on theme i) and have made some significant findings already.

Under theme i) we have found that firms patenting in Europe very significantly rely on national offices and continue to rely both on these and the European Patent Office. More specifically we have found that firms respond to changes in the ease and costs of patenting at EPO by shifting patenting activity to national offices as soon as EPO become less attractive. We are still quantifying the economic significance of this behavior. To do this we are currently collecting historical data on costs of patenting from archives across Europe and we are working to improve routines that identify and link patent owners across various national patent databases.

Under theme iii) we have shown that attempts to speed up the the patent granting process by nudging applicants are unlikely to work well at overcoming applicants' optimism bias and their overconfidence bias. That is, patent applicants think they're less likely to suffer an negative outcome than they are, and overestimate their abilities. 

More detail on them iii):
We have developed a new controlled experimental framework which tests how compliance periods in certification procedures affects the investment behaviour of applicants and the overall efficiency of the system. For example, during amendment rounds in patent examinations, would it be better for overall outcomes if applicants are forced to abide by short compliance periods, or is it better to be generous with deadlines? This is seen to be relevant in connection with the introduction of the UP and UPC, as some expect this to shift the composition of applicants for national patens towards those who, due to less professionalism, require more amendment rounds during examination.
We measured efficiency of the system by looking at a combination of how much work and effort is being wasted on certification attempts, without any chance of meeting the required threshold, on the one hand, and how often a promising outcome is forgone, on the other. We compared short compliance periods of one week to long ones of three and six weeks. 
Most of our experiments were conducted in a computer laboratory with a relatively homogenous group of mostly student participants. However, to make sure our results can be transferred to professionals, we also recruited participants at an international congress of the IP service industry and another industry event. In total, 370 people participated in our experiments in Munich and Newcastle upon Tyne, and results show that changing the available time has only limited impact between a short and intermediate deadline. In the six week long treatment, however, we find large and significant differences in overall efficiency. Compared to the one week treatment, the number of participants who engage in wasteful investment of effort declines by 6.5% and the number of participants who invest into a promising outcome increases by 10.9%. Our results therefore show that switching from a short to a generous time framework, can be efficiency enhancing. 
At the same time, our results raise some questions, as to how people decide in such situations. For one, we were unable to find a clear pattern of changes in behaviour between the short and very long deadline which could explain the change in efficiency. Furthermore, we found indications for substantial overinvestment in one of our control treatments where participants had full information about prospects. These questions need to be addressed in further research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are already feeding into work by the European Patent Office in the process of implementing the Unitary Patent Package across Europe. We expect this impact to grow as we improve the quality of our empirical results.

Detail on theme iii)

Compliance periods are relevant in many procedures and our results can be applied to various certification processes. Next to patenting, examples are certification for quality management, for eco labels or certificates of compliance with social standards, or processes of accreditation. Our findings suggest that outcomes of such processes can be improved for everyone, if applicants are not forced to abide to short deadlines. 
We have, furthermore, developed a new experimental setting to study such decision environments, and our results suggest follow up questions for further research. Why do we observe overinvestment, and what can explain our results?</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B9A49274-8614-41F8-A1AA-2428C2FE7981</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.create.ac.uk/blog/2016/04/18/much-ado-about-patents-posts-ipkat-blogger-nicola-searle/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a cross-platform software tool (Java) to extract text snippets from electronic records in text form such as court judgements or letters.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B8C86866-6957-4D71-B9D1-E094A4B2467F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are currently using the tool to build a database of outcomes of UK High Court outcomes.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Parsing tool for electronic records</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data handling &amp; control</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have linked data obtained from the JRC - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Unit Knowledge for Growth - to data on patents from PATSTAT and data from OHIM's register of EU trade marks.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3F9F2886-0747-41A9-86A0-B87D272E9740</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work analyzing the data is ongoing.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Scoreboard linked to patents and trade marks</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9C6D48F3-A628-4AF4-B05C-6E30AA3B85BB"><gtr:id>9C6D48F3-A628-4AF4-B05C-6E30AA3B85BB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Effect of Compliance Time in Patent Examination: An Experimental Study</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5f07531d624a718d3761f31b4a159154"><gtr:id>5f07531d624a718d3761f31b4a159154</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sven Fischer</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M006239/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19539613-8143-4CD6-B1E5-0C7B93D08B7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural &amp; experimental eco</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>50992D59-4D34-4EAD-9A21-B3ADAF426DA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Industrial Organisation (R&amp;D)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D6F08770-CB96-423D-89E7-3F64DE17997E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Innovation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
