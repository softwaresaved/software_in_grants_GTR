Conceptualisations of the issues framing family deprivation and need have followed a cyclical pattern, and greater inter-agency collaboration in the field of children and family services has regularly been proposed across the centuries. Yet policy initiatives tend to be characterised by 'historical amnesia'. The '&amp;quot;Troubled families&amp;quot; and inter-agency collaboration: lessons from historical comparative analysis' project is a creative demonstration of the value of secondary analysis of historically situated material for high impact contemporary voluntary agency strategy lessons. It is founded on a close partnership between the academic researchers and the Family Action voluntary agency, which has been a leading provider of services to disadvantaged families since its foundation as the Charity Organisation Society in 1869.

The study applies an historical comparative lens to explore how, over time, the problems faced and engendered by the poorest in society have been variously interpreted and addressed through collaborative agency working in times of economic constraint. It draws on a unique and under-exploited data set: archived Family Action case work papers stretching back to the late 19th century. Up to five cases for in-depth analysis will be drawn from four key historical periods, to capture the challenges faced by families themselves and family support agencies during times of economic hardship: The Long Depression (1873-1896), The Great Depression (1930-1934), The Oil Crisis (1973-1975) and The Global Crisis (2008-2012). Family cases will be selected on the basis of being: London-based; families with dependent children facing problems of poverty, ill health and poor housing; and involving at least three agencies.

The study will provide critical reflections on changes and continuities in (a) inter-agency collaboration to support families during and across four major period of economic recession and shifting scenarios of state-third sector relations, and (b) constructions of families as socially problematic and marginalised, of their needs and solutions to them. Findings from the research will feed into Family Action's strategies to enhance collaboration with other agencies, strengthen its sense of its historical identity and longer term outcomes and impact, and attract new funders for the social benefit of its users. The researchers will work in partnerships with Family Action to disseminate lessons about inter-agency collaboration to support 'troubled families' in times of economic austerity in the children, families and poverty field. In addition the research will make a contribution to the development of methodological practice for historical comparative work and knowledge about inter-agency collaboration in the sociological and social policy fields.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our detailed strategy for maximising impact, underpinned by measurable and visible pubic outputs and summarised in Pathways to Impact, aims to work in partnership with the Family Action voluntary agency to ensure a series of key short and long term benefits from our research.

For Family Action itself, the research will have an organisational impact in relation to three key areas of strategic development:

1. Development of a strategy for collaboration with other agencies in delivering services in the children, families and poverty field to support 'troubled families' in times of current and future economic austerity. The research will have a social and economic impact in providing Family Action with insights into future possibilities founded in knowledge about ways in which the organisation has collaborated with other agencies in varying contexts of economic recession and state-third sector relations over time. 

2. The embedding of a strongly rooted identity and awareness of the organisation's history: 
(i) towards its 150th anniversary celebrations in 2019, and 
(ii) an historical perspective on the agency's longer term impact. 
The research will take advantage of the power of narratives to have a social impact in considerably enhancing Family Action's knowledge and sense of the foundations, trajectory and outcomes of its practice with families facing difficulties, and providing materials to convey these publicly. 

3. Retention of established and attraction of new funders for Family Action services to the benefit of its users. Development of strategies for inter-agency collaboration and to strengthen historical identity may have an economic impact on the agency's ability to retain and raise funding, which in turn will have a social impact for users.

More widely, the partnership with Family Action will maximise impact of the research's policy and practice relevance. Insights from the research concerning inter-agency collaboration in times of economic recession and austerity to support disadvantaged and marginalised families will be of interest to government policymakers and third sector agencies in the children, families and poverty field generally. For example, lessons from the research will key directly into 'The Family Room' network's aim of supporting strategic collaboration across charities working with families, such as 4Children, Child Poverty Action Group, Children's Society, Coram, Family and Childcare Trust, Family Lives, Gingerbread, and Home Start.

Public audiences will also benefit, more indirectly, though enhanced social awareness and understanding of inter-agency collaboration to support 'troubled families'. We expect the research outcomes to be of interest to the media, and lay public. We will draw on the expertise of Family Action's media and marketing team to reach these audiences, including through online exhibition, and a high profile seminar/reception event.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151399</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Digital Interactive timeline showing the history of family support and the significance of the Charity Organisation Society in particular</gtr:description><gtr:id>8834313F-12AA-4FB1-BBEF-A311A7069FC6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The interactive timeline was displayed at the exhibition Hard Times: Reflections on Family Support from the Long Depression to the Global Crash.

Documenting family support: a mini-documentary using historical research to inform current family intervention debates
An ESRC Impact Acceleration Account award supported the cost of professional production of a mini-documentary by IliffeWard Ltd., to showcase findings from the research on historical approaches to dealing with 'troubled families'. The documentary is showcased on Family Action's website and has been promoted through their social media, receiving around 2.5k likes on Facebook. Family Action also draw on the documentary in in funding bids (both fundraising and commissioned services) and at general public events to provide an introduction to the organisation.

It is currently being used at all of their regional meetings as well as at monthly inductions, reaching staff across the organisation. Family Action feel the documentary not only provides a great introduction to their services but also boosts staff motivation and pride in their work.

In addition the film will also be used to support preparations for Family Action's 150 birthday in 2019.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>09AD7813-A376-47D9-ACFB-1ADC68827496</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project explored how agencies work together to support families in need, and how those needs and responses to them are understood in times of austerity. The study tapped the rich resource of Family Action's archived case files for four periods of austerity:

The Long Depression 1873-1896, when the agency was The Charity Organisation Society
The Great Depression 1930-1934
The Oil Crisis 1973-1975, when the agency had become The Family Welfare Association;
The Global Financial Crisis 2008-2012, when the agency had become Family Action.

Key findings
1. Perceptions of families and responses:
The problems faced by the poorest families in society remain largely the same over time: in work poverty, unemployment and poverty, debt, physical and mental ill health, poor quality and inadequate housing, maintaining children's school attendance, but interpretations of their root causes and solutions shift and reflect the sensibilities and preoccupations of the day.

In the late 19th century, family deprivation and destitution was regarded as a result of immoral character on the part of parents. In the early 1930s, the focus moved to physical health family cleanliness, tidiness and responsible lifestyle through case assessment visits. In the early 1970s, the inner workings of families comes under scrutiny with relational dynamics positioned at the core of their problems. In the 2010s, children's upbringing and poor parenting practices are posed as creating the troubles that families both face and pose for wider society. 

2. Inter-agency collaboration:
The characteristics of inter-agency relations at both agency policy and everyday practice levels are shaped by the shifting relationship between agencies and the state. Four main themes of inter-agency collaboration are in play in case work over time:

Cooperation -working together with other organisations towards an agreed position on aiding families.
Complementarity -having a distinct contribution that fits together with other agency provision
Supplementarity -providing additional services to fill gaps in other agencies' provision
Coordination -negotiating with other agencies to organise effective provision to aid families.

3. Source and type of information held on agency files:
There has been an overarching shift from a concern with identifying deservingness/eligibility to identifying and measuring risk in the trajectory of the type of information that is collected about families over time, with a an accompanying shift toward addressing the perceived needs of children rather than parents and families as a whole.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Funds have been secured from the Southampton University IAA to produce a mini documentary based on the end of project exhibition and the story it tells of the research findings. It will feature interviews with participants about what they have learned from the exhibition and key people in the family policy field about the implications of the research findings. It will feature on Family Action's website and promotional material. It will also be used to feed into Family Action's campaigning activities to shift perceptions and understandings. This will be achieved through extending the reach of the exhibition event to inform debate in the family policy field based on our research findings through Family Action drawing on it in their discussions with policymakers.

The fund manager and social enterprise Social and Sustainable Capital are also drawing on the research findings to provide a background the work they do in providing loans to family support organisations.

Findings on perceptions of families, interagency collaboration and the source and type of information collected about families will also be taken forward and developed through an academic publication timetable targeting social policy, sociology and social history publications and blogs</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EA065F41-096E-4AE5-9432-C814F900D632</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L01453X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
