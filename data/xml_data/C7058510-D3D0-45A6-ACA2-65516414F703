Despite being the most significant composer in the royal chapel of France c1500, Mouton is very poorly represented in modern recordings, and his works have not been fully edited: although the Mass settings are available in a modern edition, the motets, of which around 130 are attributed, lack a critical edition and some have not been published at all. Consequently many basic questions -regarding Mouton's style, relationship with contemporaneous and later compositional activity, and the authorship of pieces attributed to him - remain to be answered.\n\nThe project will focus on the least studied motets in Mouton's output: those still unavailable in any published edition, plus those with conflicting attributions. At the outset the Principal Investigator (PI) will gather sources and make preliminary transcriptions, followed by an intensive rehearsal period. The PI is Director of The Brabant Ensemble, a professional early music group: he will work with this ensemble in rehearsals and a workshop, with two goals in mind. First, the singers' experience and insight into performance questions such as accidental inflections and underlay will feed into the PI's understanding of Mouton's style and hence of the likely authenticity of works attributed to him. Second, the process of exploring this repertoire will contribute to the construction of programmes for concert, a CD recording, and of a radio broadcast which is intended for BBC Radio 3's Early Music Show.\n\nIn addition to the rehearsal process, the motets will be subjected to empirical analysis of several stylistic points (e.g. the number of dissonances per rhythmic unit, the average length of phrase, and the pitch range of the vocal lines). Taking into account external evidence (such as the proximity of a source attribution to the composer's known whereabouts), the information gleaned from performance experience, and the empirical data, a new understanding of Mouton's music will emerge, which the PI will make public by means of a refereed journal article.\n\nSeveral public events will contribute to knowledge transfer and the impact not only of this project but of the PI's 3-year Fellowship as a whole. A total of four concerts are planned, in Oxford, Southampton, and at music festivals in Cheltenham and York. The two festival concerts will be preceded by public talks illustrating aspects of the work undertaken. Additionally the scholarly community will be addressed via a lecture-recital at the Royal Musical Association annual conference. The CD recording will appear on the Hyperion label, which is globally distributed and well known for its promotion of underexposed repertories.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Apart from the academic beneficiaries noted elsewhere, this research will engage the general public by means of a commercially available CD (distributed globally), a radio broadcast (either on BBC Radio 3 or an analogous public-service broadcaster abroad) and four public concerts, two of which will be preceded by public talks in which the research topics will be introduced to a general audience. The research will therefore reach a wide constituency among the general public as well as the music profession.\n\nThe ongoing relationship of the Principal Investigator (PI) with Hyperion Records has developed a substantial audience of interested and informed consumers. The PI's work with The Brabant Ensemble is particularly known for its exploration of little-known aspects of Renaissance polyphony. Composers such as Dominique Phinot (c1510-before 1561), Pierre Moulu (?1484-c1550), and William Deane of Wrexham (fl1630) have been recorded, or had an entire disc devoted to their music, for the first time. Even in the case of better-known composers such as Nicolas Gombert (c1495-c1558), Crist&amp;oacute;bal de Morales (c1500-53) and the forthcoming recording of Orlandus Lassus (1530/2-94), the Brabant Ensemble has sought to include a substantial number of previously unrecorded pieces. This strategy is fully in keeping with that of Hyperion Records, which is continually praised in the music press for its championing of lesser-known music. This position within the profession renders the PI and the Ensemble ideally placed to bring newly researched Renaissance music to a wide audience. The immediate benefit will consist in a better public understanding of French cultural history as well as a greater appreciation of the specific repertories engaged, and of the advanced compositional techniques involved in creating them.\n\nPre-concert talks will be an essential element of knowledge transfer in this project. Through them it will be possible to address the topics of canon, authoriality, recompsition by later hands, and evolving views of text declamation to the public: this will result not only in transfer of historical knowledge but in a heightened ability to perceive the aesthetic goals of a group of composers whose style has at times been regarded as difficult to understand or inexpressive. In the case of the York concert, where the festival in 2011 looks back to the Festival of Britain of 1951, there will also be the opportunity to consider how the historiography of sixteenth-century music has arrived at its present position. The Cheltenham and York festivals are both leading events in national musical life; performing at these, and in Oxford and Southampton, will offer the chance to bring this research and its related performance to the North, West, and South of England.\n\nA further contribution to the nation's culture will be made via the radio broadcast. The Radio 3 Early Music Show has a distinguished history of serious investigation of topics outside the historical mainstream (for example a recent hour-long programme on Jacobus Clemens non Papa (c1510-55/6) in which several tracks from the Brabant Ensemble's CD of that composer were played). A programme on Mouton, whether within the context of the French royal chapel or directly addressing the research questions of this project, would raise the profile of this area of study considerably.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20865</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Concert in St John's, Smith Square, London in the St John's Christmas Festival 2012.

The CD recording contains all of the eight-voice motets by Mouton that the PI now considers authentically attributed; the process of editing and performance resulted in the discarding of one motet, Fulgebunt iusti/Christus vincit from the canon of Mouton's works, as well as confirming the exclusion of the conflictingly attributed Inviolata, integra et casta es. Consequently it was possible to include two extra pieces on the recording, namely the four-voice motets Factum est silentium and Bona vita, bona refectio. The last named, as well as two of the eight-voice pieces, were not (and still are not) available in any modern edition other than the 1953 dissertation of J. Shine. The Mass setting recorded, Missa Tu es Petrus, was performed in an edition by the PI based on the earlier of its two sources (Vatican MS Cap. Sist. 16), unlike the existing critical edition in Corpus mensurabilis musicae, which for reasons not given is based upon the later, Modena source.

Reception of the CD was the best of any of the PI's recordings to date: the recording was named joint Disc of the Week on the BBC Radio 3 CD Review programme, and notices in both the music press and the UK broadsheets were unanimously laudatory. A digest of press commentary is given at http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDA67933&amp;amp;vw=dc. In terms of the wider aim of increasing the availability of professional recordings of Mouton's music, it is noteworthy that another recording of his music, by the Tallis Scholars, was released three months after that by the Brabant Ensemble (hence the joint Disc of the Week mentioned above), which given that the two recordings shared only one track has contributed substantially to the visibility of Mouton on the recording scene.

As planned, a radio broadcast was made, taken from one of the concerts supported by the grant, at the York Early Music Festival in July 2011. This featured the Sanctus of Mouton's mass in juxtaposition with English and Spanish works contemporary with it, such as Pe&amp;ntilde;alosa's Missa El ojo. Because the radio broadcast did not require the purchase of studio time, it was possible in addition to take advantage of the opportunity to perform on the BBC4 television programme, Illuminations: The Private Lives of Medieval Kings, broadcast in February 2012 and repeated earlier this year. The repertoire again consisted of motets contemporaneous with Mouton, from the manuscript London, British Library, Royal 11.E.xi.

Concertgiving was as anticipated, with the Brabant Ensemble performing at the Cheltenham and York Festivals, in Oxford, and in Southampton. Subsequent concerts have also included works by Mouton, notably in the Festival de musique ancienne in Ribeauvill&amp;eacute;, France (September 2012), and the St John's Smith Square Christmas Festival in London (December 2012).</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C0D5B91-594C-4A4F-9300-C0FF8FA1B6CE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025522/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
