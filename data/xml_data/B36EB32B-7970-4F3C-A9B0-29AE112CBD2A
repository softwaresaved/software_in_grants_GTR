This inquiry aims to examine how far the treatment of UASCs meets the UK's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The inquiry responds to significant concern among children's rights organisations and professionals working with UASCs that current UK immigration law and its implementation are at odds with child protection and welfare obligations. The Committee is due to report by Easter 2013. This is therefore a particularly apposite time to bring together policy-makers, legal and health professionals, social workers, academics and UASC support organisations, as well as the young people themselves, in a seminar series focusing on research, policy and practice relating to UASCs seeking asylum. 

Nearly 1,400 unaccompanied and separated children formally seeking asylum arrived in the UK in 2011 mainly from Afghanistan (30%), Iran, Albania and Eritrea. Early figures for 2012 suggest a possible increase in numbers (Refugee Council 2012). Their legal status as asylum seekers and children, places them in a precarious position, especially as protection as children under national and international law is abruptly removed on reaching the age of 18. If their asylum claims are rejected, they may face deportation to a country which they left in challenging circumstances and where they have few, if any, support networks (Clayton 2011). Migration policies to deal with this group vary between countries, despite common international conventions including the UNCRC.

The ability of social work and healthcare professionals, fostering services and non-governmental organisations to provide appropriate support is also framed and constrained by national policy regimes and international legal obligations. Specific support is required due to the potential physical and psychological impacts of the journey itself, and the requirements to adapt to an unfamiliar and sometimes hostile social environment. Support is also required to navigate through the immigration and asylum process, and to deal with the constant fear of deportation. 

This innovative seminar series will examine the policy challenges and possible responses in supporting UASCs seeking asylum. It will also develop new insights into the theorisation of children and migration, as well as methodological debates around researching the experiences of these children and young people. It does this through 8 one-day seminars and a final two-day conference spread over three years. Each seminar focuses on a different aspect of UASCs' experiences and involves academics, practitioners and the young people themselves. 

The findings of the series will be disseminated throughout the three years via a website, blog and Twitter feed. Policy briefing documents and practice guidelines will also be produced to maximise possible impact. The series will also result in an edited book for an academic and practitioner audience, as well as academic journal articles.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As a policy issue, there is evidence that the numbers of UASCs are not likely to fall in the medium term (Refugee Council 2012) and the UK faces important international obligations, as well as social, financial and political challenges in terms of hosting and caring for UASCs. The potential impacts of this seminar series are therefore of significant importance. 

There are nine main groups of beneficiaries from this seminar series:

1. Unaccompanied children seeking asylum.
2. Policy-makers in the field of UACS seeking asylum.
3. Legal professionals working in the field of human rights and immigration law related to UASCs
4. Healthcare professionals working with UASCs
5. Social workers working with UASCs
6. Local authority children's services
7. Support organisations for UASCs
8. Foster carers of UASCs
9. Arts and media organisations working in participatory media and seeking models for this work

As the Pathways to Impact document demonstrates, we have designed the seminar series with specific input from legal professionals, healthcare professionals, social workers and support organisations. In addition, we draw on important policy and practice themes emerging from a one-day conference we co-organised in September 2012 on UASCs which attracted over 100 participants, most of whom belonged to the beneficiary groups identified above. 

The main potential benefits from this seminar series will be:

1. Greater opportunities for UASCs' voices to be heard by policy-makers and their opinions to be valued in policy development and practice. Positive feelings of wellbeing on the part of UASCs through this process of being listened to and acknowledged. 

2. Improved experiences of UASCs seeking asylum through changes in policy and professional practice, as well as shifts in the wider public's perceptions of these young people. 

3. Provision of robust evidence-based practice and policy guidance for working with UASCs seeking asylum will promote more effective support provided by legal professionals, healthcare professionals, local authority children's services and social workers engaging with these young people. 

4. Discussion of recommendations and possible implementation of findings from the Joint Parliamentary Select Committe on Human Rights inquiry into the human rights of unaccompanied migrant children and young people in the UK following its report in March/April 2013 will feed into policy development (immigration, child welfare, law), arguments used in legal proceedings and support services. 

5. Sharing of participatory arts and media methods for advocacy and therapuetic practice with UASCs and other vulnerable/ marginal groups whose voices are rarely heard.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30479</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop with social workers and psychologists</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>26E8183D-3577-4112-9A50-009030D56AA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussions sparked questions and potential areas for future collaboration

This included a presentation from Lord Roberts on legislative work on UASCs and his planned work with unaccompanied minors at the Calais camp, Gulwali Passarlay's reflections on his own experiences of migrating as a child from Afghanistan to the UK, and Nando Sigona's overview of the current situation for unaccompanied minors in Europe. Toufique Hossain (Duncan Lewis Solicitors) discussed ongoing legal challenges to UK policy, including the challenges to forced removal to Afghanistan. Emily Bowerman (Refugee Support Network) presented RSN's research on young people's experiences of return, and there was an overview of the work of Social Workers Without Borders. Finally, independent journalist Louise Tickle and Alice Klein (Media manager, Save the Children) discussed strategies to highlight the experiences of unaccompanied young people.

1. There are contradictions in the UK between the ways in which UASCs are dealt with in migration law and children &amp;amp; family law, particularly when they are approaching aged 18. 
2. There is diverse practice in supporting UASCs and foster families within the UK. Child and Family Services in local authorities rarely have specialist staff supporting UASCs, and local government cuts have exacerbated the pressures felt by social workers. The growing number of UASCs in some boroughs, linked to the rise in refugees from the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa, has created new challenges. 
3. Individual child migrants seek to develop their own sense of identity in difficult circumstances. While the journey to Europe may have been traumatic, the difficulties faced on arrival and the uncertainty as they approach 18 should not be underestimated. 
4. There needs to be targetted training and advice for social workers, foster families and others supporting UASCs regarding legal processes, particularly around the submission of asylum appeals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We will be producing short briefing papers on key topics which will be available on the Uncertain Journeys website.
