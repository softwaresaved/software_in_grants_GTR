An entity or property is emergent if it depends for its existence on other entities or properties, yet is somehow novel and distinct from them. The idea of emergence was introduced by nineteenth-century philosophers seeking to describe the problematic relationship of life and the mind to the rest of the physical world. Since the 1970s, it has also become prominent within physics as a way of understanding how complex physical systems can display new and surprising kinds of behaviour.

One can distinguish between weak and strong emergence. Weak emergence is uncontroversial, because it concerns knowledge of the world, or our description of it: a property is emergent if its existence is surprising, or could not be predicted, or if describing it requires the application of new concepts. Strong emergence, which is far more controversial, involves novelty in the world itself: new properties or objects, laws or causal powers. An emergent property's new causal powers might be exerted on the very properties from which it emerges (this is 'downward causation'). Strong emergence is controversial because it appears to conflict with principles of the causal completeness of the physical (CCP). If CCP is true, then an entity or property can exert causal influence in the physical world only if it itself is (in some sense) physical. Moreover, downward causation could not exist.

The project workshops will bring philosophers and scientists together to discuss four key groups of questions about strong emergence and the possibility of downward causation.

1. Where is the evidence for CCP? Can it be found in physics itself, or in the explanatory relationships between physics and other sciences, such as chemistry and biology? Many philosophers assume that such evidence can be found, but far fewer actively seek it out.

2. What is the best way to understand human agency? Can the mind both emerge from the physical, and also exert causal influence over it?

3. How well do physicists' candidate cases of emergence, such as phase transitions and symmetry breaking, fit philosophers' conceptions of emergence?

4. Do biological and social systems provide examples of strong emergence?

Although scientists and philosophers both use the term 'emergence,' communication between them is hampered by the different meanings they attach to it. Debate between philosophers is also hampered by the differing presuppositions (such as CCP) that underlie the entrenched positions of emergentists and their opponents. In this project we aim to relate philosophers' and scientists' conceptions of emergence, and to expose the presuppositions of different sides of the emergence debates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project can be expected to benefit the following groups of people:

(1) University students of philosophy and the sciences and (2) members of the wider public who are interested in the methods and results of science, how far (if at all) the theories of different scientific disciplines fit together into a coherent account of the world, and the place of the mind in the natural world.

The proposed research will benefit these groups by offering them:

(1) an enhanced understanding of a range of alternative interpretations of the complex evidence available from the empirical sciences on the question of the unity of the natural world, and the ability to critically examine such alternative interpretations in the light of that evidence;
(2) an enhanced understanding of alternative accounts of the place of the mind in the natural world, and the ability to critically examine such alternatives;
(3) an enhanced understanding of the perspectives and methods of different parts of philosophy and the sciences, and how these different perspectives and methods can mutually inform each other.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25077</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project benefited the following groups of people:

In line with this aim, the four workshops explored the following questions: 1. Where is the evidence for the causal closure principle?; 2. Can the mind both emerge from the physical, and exert causal influence over it?; 3. How well do physicists' candidate cases of emergence, such as phase transitions and symmetry breaking, fit philosophers conceptions of emergence?; 4. Do biological and social systems provide examples of strong emergence? Speakers at the workshops included central figures in the emergence debate both from within philosophy and the sciences. The talks and the resulting discussions brought philosophers and scientists together to discuss strong emergence and resulted in much fruitful discussion. Speakers views on the listed topics differed widely, and the conclusions of their papers are too varied to list here. But two of the key findings were that scientists, philosophers of mind and philosophers of science understandings of the term 'emergence' often differed widely--some were understanding it in a strong sense, others in a weak. And, that both philosophers and scientists strongly disagreed about whether there is any plausible evidence for the causal closure principle, either of an empirical or metaphysical kind.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The PI and Co-I (with Tom Lancaster of Durham's Department of Physics) are co-editing the 'Routledge Handbook of Emergence'. This will include 38 articles by scientists and philosophers addressing all aspects of emergence, including the research objectives of the project. Invited contributors include many of the speakers at the workshop. It is planned that the book be published in 2017. 
In addition, as proposed, the PI wrote a journal article on the causal closure principle , downward causation and the powers theory of causation, which has since been in published in 'The Philosophical Quarterly'. She also prepared two chapters of a book, 'Being in Mind', which Oxford University Press has expressed interest in publishing. The Co-I has submitted, for journal publication, a paper reviewing arguments for and against the causal closure principle based on the empirical sciences, and their historical development.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>33222C86-AC52-4689-AE9F-659B5838F814</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://durhamemergenceproject.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication
