His interpretation of Ariosto's deranged hero could have easily marked the climax of a long and successful career and be received as a synthesis of his musical and dramatic experiences accumulated over a period of more than thirty years. On the eve of Senesino's return to Italy in 1735, however, Orlando turned out to be a real anti-climax and resulted in the definitive rupture with Handel.\nThe proposed monograph takes the move from a consideration of the unconventionality of the role of Orlando in Handel's eponymous opera to extend the investigation to the European operatic and theatrical tradition through a reconstruction and a critical appraisal of Senesino's career. It encompasses a biography of the singer, which covers the little known years of apprenticeship and early career in Italy preceding the singer's arrival in London in 1719, his relationship with other singers, impresarios, actors etc, a commented iconography of the singer, as well as an assessment of his operatic roles from the dramatic and musical standpoint. This allows the observation of the dynamic exchange between the demands placed upon the singer by the composers he worked with, and the ways in which his skills and artistic discernment were able to modify compositional and performance practice, influence repertory (see, for example, his role in the choice and revision of Arsace at the Haymarket in 1721), and reception (see, for example, J. Mainwaring's comments on Handel's Radamisto). This alone would form an important and original contribution to Senesino's research (or indeed to research on singers), as while the singer's share in the composition and performance of Handel's operas has been the focus of C. S. Larue, Handel and his Singers, his role in the composition, performance and reception of Bononcini's and Ariosti's operas still awaits consideration; the same could be said of his performance in the operas by F. Gasparini, A. Lotti, T. Albinoni, L. Leo, A. Scarlatti, L. Vinci and N. Porpora.\nTo this end, I consider numerous printed libretti and manuscript scores together with contemporary writings on singing and Italian acting, such as those by P. J. Martello (1715), F. Tosi (1721), L. Riccoboni (1728;1738), G. Manfredi (1746), J. J. Quantz (in F. W. Marpurg, 1754), F. Agricola (1757), and G. B. Mancini (1777). The methodology that I employ to relate music, dramatic texts and theoretical writings on singing and acting, based on the principles of rhetoric, was developed in my previous monograph (Italian Opera and European Theatre, 1680-170: Plots, Performers, Dramaturgies) and is also used in my two forthcoming articles on Senesino. \nThe theoretical writings mentioned above cast Francesco Bernardi as the embodiment of a style of singing and, generally, of performing, which was associated with the golden age of Italian music, the age of composers such as Giovanni Bononcini and Alessandro Scarlatti, and of singers such as Vittoria Tesi and Francesca Cuzzoni; a tradition that in turn came implicitly to be opposed to the style of younger composers, such as Nicola Porpora, and virtuosi such as Faustina Bordoni, and, above all, Farinelli - with all of whom Bernardi had worked. An in-depth and all-round study of Francesco Bernardi therefore, offers the opportunity to not only further our knowledge of eighteenth-century singers, their status and career, but also assess their role in the transformation of compositional practice, performance and taste, within the context of the European operatic and theatrical traditions.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35940</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1734E8AB-7552-46BA-8701-B39804976A54"><gtr:id>1734E8AB-7552-46BA-8701-B39804976A54</gtr:id><gtr:title>Senesino's Negotiations with the Royal Academy of Music: Further Insight into the Riva-Bernardi Correspondence and the Role of Singers in the Practice of Eighteenth-Century Opera</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cambridge Opera Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/279e79014051069cbbba3e0631473e40"><gtr:id>279e79014051069cbbba3e0631473e40</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bucciarelli M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0954-5867</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DBA1F6E6-4884-4863-9AA2-87EF08437EA0"><gtr:id>DBA1F6E6-4884-4863-9AA2-87EF08437EA0</gtr:id><gtr:title>'FAR&amp;Ograve; IL POSSIBILE PER VINCER L'ANIMO DI M.R HANDEL': SENESINO'S ARRIVAL IN LONDON AND ARSACE'S RHETORIC OF PASSIONS</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Eighteenth Century Music</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/56e4787516b42f7172f07448a70c1aaa"><gtr:id>56e4787516b42f7172f07448a70c1aaa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>BUCCIARELLI M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F00608X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8F220D14-A48F-413D-9D9E-0756C51CE2B0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
