Looking 10-20 years ahead, multi-gigabit wireless communications will play an even more prominent role in the evolution and development of our unwired networked society. This project is proposed at a time when gigabit per second wireless communications is envisioned to bring a fundamental shift to the design of future smart environments. The results of this project will trigger the emerging concept of smart environments, ranging from smart materials controlled or manipulated at the nanoscale, to smart cities with massive deployment of sensors and monitoring systems. In particular, the widespread availability and demand for multimedia capable devices and multimedia content have fuelled the need for high-speed wireless connectivity beyond the capabilities of existing commercial standards. The technologies developed in this project will address practical issues concerning the design and implementation of next generation multi-gigabit wireless applications enabling low cost fibre replacement mobile backhauls, last mile wireless broadband access, ultra-dense small cells, low latency uncompressed high-definition media transfers, and wireless access to the cloud. The challenges and fundamental limits of future networked societies can only be mastered by exploring the disruptive potential of low-interference high-speed wireless links for smart and sustainable environments.

The results of this project will have immediate impact on advancing the state-of-the-art in mobile and ubiquitous computing for multi-gigabit-per-second data rates, supporting new wireless platforms such as cloud computing and tactile Internet to handle large quantities of data and thus to underpin the Internet of Everything (IoE) as a truly networked society connecting hundreds of billions of people, objects, and services. In particular, the concepts, algorithms, and theory developed in this project will address practical issues concerning the unbalanced temporal and geographical variations of the spectrum, along with the rapid proliferation of bandwidth-hungry mobile applications, such as video streaming with high definition television (HDTV) and ultra-high definition video (UHDV). Even though wireless channel impairments greatly impact the bandwidth efficiency of wireless networks, their effects have not been taken into consideration in the recent research carried out in this discipline, especially in the microwave and millimetre-wave bands for fifth generation (5G) cellular. The objective of this project is to improve the bandwidth efficiency of next generation 5G operating in the microwave and millimetre-wave bands through effective transmitter and receiver designs that exploit massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and heterogeneous small cell deployment, while taking into account the effects of impairments, such as channel estimation error, phase noise, and carrier frequency offset. As a result, this project is not based on any idealistic assumptions regarding the wireless channel, which compared to existing work in this field is unique. The proposed research certainly raises several fundamental design challenges far from trivial, that have their roots in diverse disciplines, including information theory, stochastic control theory, sequential statistics, large system analysis, automated decision making, and pervasive computing. Industrial partners will be engaged throughout the project to ensure industrial relevance of our work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Mobile and ubiquitous computing is one of the greatest innovations in the history of technology, as we live in an increasingly connected, automated, and globalised society of smart environments where the physical world is connected with the information world. In such an exciting era of smart environments that are extensively equipped with sensors, actuators, and computing components, unprecedented challenges are brought to the global wireless service providers and regulators. Today, in the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of connected devices is growing at an astonishing rate, resulting in a massive increase in the average number of connections per household. Particularly, the use of the Internet has evolved. Gone are the days of browsing simple web pages. Nowadays consumers leverage the Internet for sharing high resolution images, streaming over-the-top video content, interactive online gaming, cloud storage and more. Leading industry experts are calling for the fifth generation (5G) networks to provide 1000x capacity increase over the fourth generation (4G), as the world anticipates more connected devices and services, such as smart buildings, smart vehicles, and smart wearables. This project is proposed at a time when ultra-broadband gigabit-speed mobile links is envisioned to bring a fundamental shift to the design of future smart environments. 

The results of this project will have immediate impact on advancing the state-of-the-art of mobile and ubiquitous computing for smart environments, supporting new wireless platforms such as cloud computing and tactile Internet to connect hundreds of billions of smart devices, from miniscule chips to mammoth machines, inevitably reliant on gigabit per second wireless connectivity. In fact, the IoT world is growing at a staggering pace, from 2 billion devices in 2006 to a projected 200 billion in 2020. The main capacity limitation of such an unwired networked society is the air interface due to limited bandwidth. Therefore, this project tackles one of the most challenging and important problems, maximising bandwidth efficiency for the future unwired networked society of high-speed wireless links, which is limited by channel impairment, synchronisation, and interference. The challenges and fundamental limits of the unwired networked society of connected products and services can only be solved using the three key technologies identified in this project: millimetre wave, massive MIMO, and small cells. These technologies will promote multi-gigabit speed wireless for low cost mobile backhauls, last mile broadband access, ultra-dense small cells, low latency uncompressed high-definition media transfers, and wireless access to the cloud and other large data repositories. The industrial partner BT has been analysing the benefits of millimetre wave and network densification i.e., small cells, in its fast growing network to overcome the air interface limitation. BT strongly believes that millimetre wave and small cells are potential solutions for the high-speed traffic in mobile networks. Gigabit speeds will also have the potential to improve education and distance learning, close the digital divide by providing equal access to all and extend online healthcare to remote areas, all while accelerating economic development. The potential beneficiaries of the gigabit wireless solutions developed in this project are industries specializing in: 1) virtual computing environments with smart devices for pertinent and context-aware services of augmented reality and 3D gaming, 2) physical environments with smart devices of sensors, tags, and controllers for industrial Internet of things of intelligent monitoring and autonomous decision-making and 3) humans environments with smart devices of wearables such as healthcare and well-being monitoring devices and high definition body-to-body communication.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>332387</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The algorithms and theories developed in this research addresses practical issues relating to the unbalanced temporal and geographical variations of the spectrum, along with the rapid proliferation of bandwidth-hungry mobile applications, such as video streaming with high definition television (HDTV) and ultra-high definition video (UHDV).

A promising new transmission framework is proposed, in which NOMA is adopted in small cells and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is deployed in macro cells. Our results demonstrate that: 1) The coverage probability of NOMA enhanced small cells is affected by the targeted transmit rates and power sharing coefficients of two NOMA users; 2) Massive MIMO enabled macro cells are capable of enhancing the spectrum efficiency by increasing the number of antennas; 3) The energy efficiency of the whole HetNets can be improved by densely deploying NOMA enhanced small cell base stations (BSs); and 4) The proposed NOMA enhanced HetNets transmission scheme has superior performance compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based HetNets.

Key Findings 2: Power control for multi-cell networks with non-orthogonal multiple access: We consider the problems of minimizing sum power and maximizing sum rate for multi-cell networks with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). For sum power minimization, we transform it into an equivalent linear problem with fewer variables and obtain the optimal power allocation strategy for users in closed-form expressions, which shows that the user with poor channel gain should be allocated more power. To solve the nonconvex sum rate maximization problem, we prove that the power allocation problem for a single cell is a convex problem. Further, by analysing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we reveal that the optimal power allocation strategy for each base station (BS) is to allocate additional power to its served user with the best channel gain, while other users served by this BS are allocated with minimum power to maintain their minimum rate requirements. Based on this observation, the original sum rate maximization problem can be simplified to an equivalent problem with variables in dimension of the total number of BSs. We show that the objective function of the simplified problem can be readily rewritten as a minimization of a difference of convex functions (DC). Based on this representation, DC programming approach is used to transform and approximate the simplified problem to convex optimization problems. By solving this set of approximately convex problems iteratively, a suboptimal solution to the sum rate maximization problem is obtained.

Key Findings 3: Joint pilot allocation and robust transmission design for user-centric ultra-dense C-RAN with imperfect CSI: This work provides a unified framework to deal with the new challenges arising in ultra-dense cloud radio access networks (C-RAN), especially the unavailability of complete channel state information (CSI). We adopt a user-centric cluster technique to reduce the computational complexity, and consdier partial CSI to alleviate the channel training overhead where only large-scale inter-cluster CSI is necessary. Channel estimation for intra-cluster CSI is also considered. Based on these, a novel pilot allocation algorithm is proposed by considering the multi-user equipment (UE) pilot interference. We also consider a robust beam-vector optimisation problem subject to UEs' data rate and fronthaul capacity constraints, where the effects of channel estimation error and partial inter-cluster CSI are taken into account. We proposed successive convex approximation and semi-definite relaxation to solve this problem with convergence guarantee. We strictly prove that semi-definite relaxation is tight with probability 1. Extensive simulation results show the fast convergence of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art existing algorithms.
