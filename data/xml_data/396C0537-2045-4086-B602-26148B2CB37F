Cross-disciplinary social scientific tools will be developed to explain the structures and processes that shape learning moments such that ?what works? does work, and why ?what works? in one school or classroom might ?work? less well or differently in another, or might be capable or incapable of ?scaling up?.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Focusing directly on practitioner concerns and experiences of working in classrooms situated in contexts characterised as ?disadvantaged?, the seminar series will enable:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>genuine and innovative interdisciplinary working between scholars, with all the tensions and challenges that this entails&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a diverse community to engage with research and theory from fields outside education to provide new challenge and understanding&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a theoretical reframing of the paralysing structure/agency debates of recent years.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries of these seminars will be practitioners: teachers looking for resources to help them to spend the pupil premium and narrow educational gaps, and those working towards advanced professional qualifications (including teachers and headteachers, educational psychologists and social workers). The books and web-based case study materials will provide them with wider and deeper understandings of the problems of disadvantage and education, and different ways to think about how to change their own practice or make the case for changes in policy and funding. These will principally be aimed at UK users although our experience suggests that the issues that the materials will address are internationally recognised and there is considerable international use of UK-based literature and resources. International use can be promoted by the international contributors to the series.

Another key audience will be UK policy-makers and opinion formers, including politicians, civil servants, lobby groups and think tanks, concerned with what to do about the problem of links between disadvantage and educational success. 

Through its impacts on practitioners and on policy-makers this work is ultimately designed to improve educational experiences and outcomes for disadvantaged children in the UK, thus enhancing their well-being and life chances, and contributing to the UK's goal of having a better educated and more globally competitive workforce and greater educational equity. The effectiveness of state-maintained schools and of educational policy will be enhanced. Realistically, this will not happen overnight. The seminars will aim to shift the ways we think about educational disadvantage and how to tackle it, such that in ten years time the dominant paradigm will be one that incorporates different kinds of social scientific knowledge, leading scholars from different disciplines to engage actively with each other and with policy and practice. The discursive framing of problem and solution will begin to change, in academic journals, teacher training and professional development, and in policy conversations. This seminar series is well designed and well placed to start this process.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30303</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>At this early stage of the work of the seminar series we have conducted the two-day teacher-practitioner and three-day academic workshops. 
The range of issues emerging from the teacher-practitioner workshop generated some surprises - particularly the lack of explicit mention of 'poverty'. This lack of direct concern for 'poverty' as an issue surprised the academics and has forced us to think. As we are plan the follow-up seminars and the first book an issue for us is how to think about absence or silence in the foundation data.
The first seminar takes place immediately after this reporting period and will be attended by some of the original practitioners and academics as well as others from universities in the UK. As we begin to involve a wider group of academics, practitioners and other professionals we look forward to developing the scope of the debates.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>723649A5-6477-4128-A7D1-D733E3F08B1A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Initial workshops for teachers and academics have successfully highlighted issues to be taken up in forthcoming seminars.
