WPs1+2: Team meeting and interviews to identify stakeholders, data and scope. Development of city-systems analysis approach, integration of team's existing models with online systems mapping platform. City-systems workshop to map relationships, identify data required, and confirm project scope. Qtr 1 report setting out progress to date. Lead: db+a/UoBristol. 3 months. [DB:85/MY:27/AH:5/BHP:10/GCAP:6/UWE:2]
WP3: Source and re-format relevant data sets, GIS mapping and extraction of targeted data enquiries revealing vulnerabilities to populate economic valuation work. Lead: db+a/BCC. 3 months. [DB:20/AH:5/BHP:5/BCC:10] WP4: Development of economic valuation models, including quantification of potential climate impacts within envelopes of confidence. Value testing of model outputs through a series of interviews with relevant senior level stakeholders (e.g. risk managers). Finessing of data extraction and economic valuation re-modelling following feedback. Lead: UoBath/db+a. 3 months. [DB:20/AH:25/BHP:5/BCC:5]
WP5: Second large interactive systems analysis workshop and follow up interviews with relevant local decision- makers and national/international influencers to capture impact of evidence on decision-makers (e.g. risk committees) to identify second stage actions and tipping points including sketching out changes in resource commitment. Final report and strategic recommendations for end users, documentation of process methods and reflection on the process of developing the prototype. Review through Advisory Panel workshop. Lead: db+a/UoBristol. 3 months with lead in for invitations. [DB:40/MY:20/AH:4/BHP:5/GCAP:4/UWE:1]
WP6: Large market assessment workshop aimed at local authorities, clinical commissioning groups, and health and wellbeing boards. Lead: db+a. Time: overlapping with WP5. [DB:35/MY:5/AH:5/BHP:5/GCAP:4]
This a large consortium with collaborating sub-contractors, advisors, and a wide range of stakeholders taking part in the market assessment, requiring considerable liaison, coordination and management by db+a. We do not have rival technologies as much as potential competing consultancies. Our approach offers a better outcome given the industry-leading quality of the consortium and the unusual level of interest from and access to the wider market.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary direct beneficiary of this feasibility study is the Bristol Health Partners consortium, whilst other direct beneficiaries include the stakeholders involved in - or affected by - the activities of the Health Partnership. The potential indirect beneficiaries include all those organisations that use the diagnostic tools to be developed by the proposed study. The University of Bath is responsible for the application of the adaptation cost-benefit analysis tool proposed in the study. In the first instance, these are envisaged to be other health partnerships though the generic components of the tools will allow straightforward application to all organisations who identify climate change risks as potentially significant to their activities.
Bristol Health Partners will be engaged by being included as a partner in the study. Thus, personnel from the Partnership will be involved in the development of the tools from the outset. The personnel will therefore be consulted at each decision point in the research such that all aspects regarding their usability and usefulness as diagnostic tools in the management of climate risks are optimised. We plan that telecommunications (e-mail, phone, Skype, etc.) will facilitate day-to-day contact between the academic partners and the Partnership, in additional to the formal workshops and meetings planned for the course of the study. This process will begin in Month 1 and continue over the twelve months of the study. In the formulation of this prospective study it has been established that the Partnership will not only work with the other project plans to specify the climate risks of most significance to their activities, but also to supply the tool developers with sufficient data to appropriately populate the tools and facilitate their operation.
The stakeholders associated with the Partnership will have an input into the design of the tools via the planned workshops as well as in subsequent bilateral contact, as requested or required. Via these communication routes they will help to maximise the efficacy of the tools. The up-take of these tools beyond the period of the feasibility study will be a function of their perceived usefulness in relation to their cost. Their up-take and use will be promoted and tracked by the co-ordinating partner.
The Researcher from Bath University, (Dr Alistair Hunt), will be responsible for the application of the adaptation cost-benefit analysis tool and will therefore be directly involved in communications with potential beneficiaries over the course of the study. Dr Hunt has been involved in a number of activities with the UK Climate Impacts Programme and Defra, including the development of guidelines for costing climate change impacts, which have required extensive stakeholder engagement through a series of participatory workshops. The impact activities to be undertaken by Bath University will be supported by the personnel costs requested for Dr Hunt, together with the associated travel and subsistence costs. Dr Mike Yearworth (University of Bristol) is an expert in Problem Structuring Methods (PSMs) and a skilled facilitator of group model building workshops. He has carried out extensive research in developing systems modelling methodology and has applied this research primarily in the energy, waste and transport domains. Recent outputs from this work are indicated in Dr Yearworth's CV. He will lead the key stakeholder participation engagements in the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19874</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Bristol Health Partners</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Bristol Health Partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>629005D4-FF90-400D-AA2F-F106A444579A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are currently interacting with the Executive Board of BHP in order to define how we can continue to input into their decision-making.
