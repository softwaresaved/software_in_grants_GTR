Proto-policy is part of the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities Research Council-funded project ProtoPublics, which aims to support researchers and community partners to become active participants in 'crafting new services, experiences, projects and policies that address contemporary issues' (http://protopublics.org/). For the purposes of this pilot, Proto-policy will focus on issues of ageing in place (people remaining in their homes rather than move to institutional facilities) and isolation. 

Imagining alternative ways of living in old age has become a cultural preoccupation, hence the extraordinary popular success of the 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel', yet talking to older people about the future (particularly the 'older old', those aged 80+) is virtually taboo. This project uses design fictions to address that taboo by inviting older people to imagine and, with the assistance of a designer, create visual texts (artefacts, images, films) that materialise scenarios, or provide clues to, future ways of living in compelling ways. 

Proto-policy will run a series of creative workshops with residents in Miners Court, an assisted-care housing complex in Redruth Cornwall, and the second with elders living in their own homes in Lancaster (in conjunction with Age UK Lancaster), respond to the 'Ageing in Place' policy agenda by co-creating future design fictions that envisage what a future of 'flexible living' - a third space that has the benefits of independent living without the downsides of loneliness, fear and vulnerability - might look like. These would be shared with politicians in a 'design fiction provocation' event to be held in Westminster in order to help negotiate political questions. 

Through its project partners, the All-Party Parliamentary Design and Innovation Group (APDIG) and Age UK, this project seeks to build a shared understanding of the constraints and opportunities of political issues around Ageing in Place and loneliness through design fictions. The APDIG is a cross-party coalition of parliamentarians and design sector organisations that works to develop new design policy ideas and critique existing government decision-making around design.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact is embedded throughout the project activities and the community/politician engagements themselves. Politicians may come to understand the implications of a policy idea differently; community and interest groups may feel that their voices have been heard in a different way - and they may also themselves have been brought to a different view about both the issue in question, and the political institutions they interact with through the process. In terms of learning beyond the immediate context of the engagements, with a new Parliament, it is hoped that politicians will be at this moment in time more receptive to new and different ideas about engaging with a wider public, and therefore findings delivered through the APDIG will find a political audience. An APDIG policy paper to outline the project will build on previous publications exploring how design can be better used in policymaking, the most substantial being Restarting Britain 2: Design and Public Services (2012). An articulation of the specific and potential contribution of design fictions in this context will also provide new knowledge and understandings for the academic community in design and also political science. Dissemination through Age UK's national network will raise awareness and interest on the potential of social design helping charities, organisations and community groups in promoting the ageing, as well as other agendas of policy interest to politicians and political audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11531</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Euthanasia Wearable Design Fiction comprises of two documents, namely a quick start guide, a anti-Euthanasia campaign flyer and a Euthanasia Wearable prototype.

Working in groups, workshop participants looked at policy document extracts on the themes of ageing, ageing in place and loneliness/isolation and responded to these.

A number of themes emerged from grouping our co-designers responses to policy. These themes were then used to co-create design micro-fictions looking at 5 years, 10 years into the future and beyond, which were shared within the workshop. 

Further grouping of the design micro-fictions were grouped revealed a number of interesting themes (i.e. communication, transport, independent living and health economy) and technologies (i.e. Skyping and holograms, self-drive cars, pop-up community buildings, escalators at home/garden and several more) relating to ageing in place and social isolation.

recognition that citizens need to be at the centre of policy and public
service development processes. A generic design approach advocates: 1) rapid
problem definition; 2) jointly developing solutions with stakeholders; 3) prototyping;
and 4) analysing user feedback prior to full scale deployment. While
it was initially perceived by the research team that design methods, and in
particular speculative design or design fictions, may not be considered rigorous
enough by civil servants or politicians, in fact, there was a perception that
design may not be rapid enough for the time constraints of policy and political
decision-making. In addition to the issue of timescales, further barriers to
using design fictions for the first time as perceived by the
politician included cost, ensuring productive debate and
the pressures of public opinion and party lines. However,
among the civil servants who had already used design fictions
for policy-making, the challenges focused on translating
the outcomes into evidence including drawing conclusions
from small sample sizes, ensuring a connection to
the research question, collecting meaningful data, adopting
abductive inference and the subsequent implications for
validity and reliability. Creating the design fictions with citizens
is only one step in the process; the key step is the
facilitation between the design researchers and the participants.
Nevertheless, conducted appropriately, design fictions should respond
to the growing trends of open policy-making in government. With additional
advocacy efforts design methods could be positioned as a tool for politicians
to generate greater participation by constituents in political decision-making.
Although design methods in general, let alone more specialised design methods
such as design fictions and speculative design, may not be well-known by
politicians, with a growing capacity for design-driven innovation in the UK
civil service a future trend could be for design to permeate through to the
political scene.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Recommendations for employing design fictions in generating debate around policy initiatives amongst diverse community groups via imagining the future implications of policy initiatives in creative ways.
