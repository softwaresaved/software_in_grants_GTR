The seminar presented the first results from this systematic study of trends in public opinion in Scotland and England. Based on research conducted in parallel on the latest Scottish and British Social Attitudes surveys, it addressed three main questions:



? Is Scotland really more social democratic than England? 



? Does Scotland really have a different outlook on social and moral issues? 



? Has the advent of devolution served to widen the differences between the two countries?

The assertion that Scotland is more social democratic in its values in England is frequently asserted north of the border. The findings of this research that case some doubt on that claim were frequently cited by the researcher and others during the Scottish independence referendum campaign.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AqMen 2014 Annual Lecture</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>067D34CF-5712-4D12-9B6D-785D9B351161</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Post event discussion

Moreover, although many of the response distributions to relevant survey questions were only mildly different in the two countries, the differences that did exist could not adequately be accounted for by differences in their social composition or the distribution of party political sympathies. Rather, what mattered was that those with a strong sense of Scottish identity were more likely to adopt a social democratic outlook, implying that attempts by politicians and others to secure support for such an outlook by appealing to that sense of identity had some potential to succeed.



However, there is no systematic evidence that during the course of the subsequent ten years public opinion in Scotland has become more social democratic relative to that in England. Rather, there has been a parallel decline on both sides of the border in support for a social democratic outlook, a decline that has occurred irrespective of people's sense of national identity (or indeed any other characteristic). Consequently Scotland still appears to be somewhat more social democratic than England, but no more so than ten years ago, while in absolute terms Scotland is less social democratic now than previously.



This remains the case even if we focus on a policy area for which responsibility has been devolved and where a very distinctive public policy has been pursued. Opposition to the idea that at least some university students should pay tuition fees, never much greater than in England in the first place, has fallen markedly in Scotland - in line with the trend south of the border.



Even in 2000 there was no systematic difference between Scotland and England in the incidence of socially conservative views. That remains the case now. Moreover, where public opinion in England has become more liberal, as for example in the case of same sex relationships, much the same trend is also evident in Scotland.



It thus appears that the development of distinctive policy communities in Scotland has had no discernible impact on trends in public opinion north of the border. While the balance of opinion within those communities may be more social democratic and socially conservative than in England, the distinctive tenor of these debates does not percolate through to public attitudes. It seems we have to remember that while people in Scotland are exposed to the policy debates that take place north of the border, they are not insulated from those taking place in England too, not least because their content is disseminated in Scotland by UK-wide media outlets. Equally, where social attitudes are changing as a result of social change, that change may well be occurring throughout the UK. 



Consequently, there seems no reason to believe that devolution is widening differences in social attitudes - and thus giving rise to increasing pressure for divergent policies that may be difficult to accommodate within the framework of the Union.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research is highly relevant to the continuing policy debate about Scotland's constitutional status, and in particular whether the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament is consistent with the maintenance of the Union.
