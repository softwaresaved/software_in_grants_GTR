A sustainable route to capture energy from the Sun involves using photocatalytic materials that, upon solar irradiation, rearrange the electrons in molecules such as water and carbon dioxide and consequently form fuels such as hydrogen and hydrocarbons and harmless oxygen. This route, typically called artificial photosynthesis, has the potential to ensure affordable supplies of clean fuels and feedstocks for energy, pharmaceuticals, plastics and textiles, simply using inexhaustible resources.
 
The aim of this project is to make a breakthrough in the synthesis of metal oxides with tailored nanostructure to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of artificial photosynthesis devices in the formation of clean fuels such as hydrogen. In order to achieve this, graphene oxide flakes, carbon mats known for its nano and two-dimensionality, will be systematically studied as a sacrificial support for the formation of metal oxide nanoflakes replicating the graphene oxide shape. This will lead to a more optimised morphology to exploit the qualities of metal oxides in artificial photosynthesis. 
 
The project will follow a multidisciplinary approach involving the undertaking of different activities, namely wet chemical syntheses, devices construction and advanced characterisation to achieve its aim. Each of these activities will address a different challenge. Through wet chemical syntheses, the project will aim to understand the mechanisms to replicate the nano- and two-dimensionality of graphene oxide on metal oxides. The second activity will concentrate on finding the best routes to apply the novel metal oxides for solar fuels production. The third activity will have the challenge of characterising the photocatalytic nanostructured materials in such a way to relate their properties to their activity, allowing the optimisation of the devices. 
 
Preparing metal oxides with nano- and two-dimensionality as in graphene oxide will have a considerable impact on the research of these materials and on their application. This will ensure important advances towards a more sustainable
energy mix of clean energy for current and future generations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will research for the first time both (1) the formation of a family of nanostructured metal oxides using graphene oxide as a sacrificial support and (2) their application in hydrogen fuel generation using solar irradiation. This is particularly important, since the world energy use is predicted to increase from 19 TW in 2015 to 27 TW by 2040 and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel consumption need to be significantly reduced to address global warming. Although academics conducting research in the renewable energy and catalysis sector will be the primary beneficiaries of this research, the outcomes of this project are also likely to have an impact in a near future on the fine chemical industry, which requires catalysts with optimised surface area and morphology. More broadly, the results of this research aim to contribute towards a more sustainable society and cleaner and healthier environment.
 
Companies will benefit from the novel protocols researched to prepare nanostructured catalysts in this project because these materials will offer much higher performances in applications such as solar hydrogen production. In addition to contributing towards the creation of more efficient devices that use clean energy, there will also be opportunities to apply the novel materials in other technologies such as car catalytic converters and pharmaceutics syntheses. To ensure companies are aware of and benefit from this research, we will exploit the events organised by the Centres for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Catalysis and in Sustainable Chemical Technologies, which companies in the renewable energy and catalysis sectors regularly attend. For example, every summer within the CDT in Sustainable Chemical Technologies a Summer Showcase is organised by the CDT members and affiliates, where the research is presented and discussed among academics and members of the industry. Conferences and seminars where industry regularly participate such as the UK Catalysis Conference 2018 will also be used for dissemination and engagement with industry. Filing patent applications with the research inventions of this project will ensure the intellectual property is identified and protected for future commercialisation. 

The general public will benefit from this research with next generation materials that produce hydrogen fuel from simply sun and water, diversifying the energy portfolio. The researchers of this proposal will participate in public engagement activities, including the Bath Science Caf&amp;eacute; and the Bath Taps into Science, to engage with a wider audience. The Bath Science Caf&amp;eacute; is a monthly event where researchers can informally explain the latest ideas in science and technology and debate the topics. The Bath Taps into Science is a science festival happening in March every year, with multiple stands covering most of research areas at University of Bath. Newsletters, magazines and press media will also be used (in addition to peer-reviewed scientific journals) to approach a more general audience. In addition to the University of Bath online communication resources such as its website and e-newsletter, a more specific group website will be set up where videos, posters and highlights will regularly be uploaded.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100740</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P008097/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>55</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>45</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>55</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>45</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
