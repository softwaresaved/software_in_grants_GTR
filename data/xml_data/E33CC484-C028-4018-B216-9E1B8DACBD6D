1875-1940</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K006223/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Interdisciplinarity, particularly between the arts and the sciences, is notoriosly difficult to achieve. This project takes one particular historical case study in order to understand disciplinary difference at a crucial moment in the past. Oliver Lodge (1851-1940) was a key figure in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century culture. Today, however, he remains relatively neglected, largely because of the apparent contradictions between different aspects of his career. This research network uses these contradictions as a starting point to consider the role of the disciplines in shaping knowledge. Taking Lodge as a case study allows us to understand the place of science in his period and to learn how disciplinary boundaries continue to structure research and knowledge today. 

Lodge has much to teach us about the place of science in culture because, in his life and career, he transcended many of the boundaries we imagine structure the cultural status of science. A pioneer of wireless telegraphy, Lodge was an internationally-acclaimed physicist and engineer, equally at home in laboratory and workshop. Alongside his commercial interests Lodge carved out a career in the new Victorian universities, becoming the first professor of physics at the University of Liverpool and then Principal of the University of Birmingham after its move to Edgbaston. Not only did Lodge help science consolidate its place at the heart of the university, but he also saw the institutionalisation of the differences between scientific disciplines. A prolific writer, speaker and, later in his life, broadcaster, Lodge was widely known as a populariser of science and commentator on current affairs. Yet in the latter part of his life, Lodge became a famous spiritualist, carrying out psychical investigations alongside his scientific research and publishing a besteller, Raymond (1916), detailing encounters with his son killed in the trenches. Focusing on Lodge can help us understand the differences between science and the arts and humanities; the place of faith and the imagination in scientific practice; and the role of the arts and humanities in popularising science.
 
To understand a career such as Lodge's, it is necessary to take an interdsciplinary approach. The project is designed to bring together a range of scholars, archivists and museum professionals at four workshops, each focusing on a particular aspect of Lodge's career. The first will consider the place of science in the new Victorian universities; the second the many ways that signalling though space was understood in the period; the third Lodge's physics and engineering and the supposed differences between pure and applied science; the fourth scientific lives more generally, investigating different tools and methodological approaches for the study of historical scientific figures. The project will maintain a blog, enabling conversation to continue between workshops and extend the network beyond the immediate participants; it will include a public demonstration of Victorian popular science, exploring the way in which scientific ideas were communicated in the past; lastly, it will publish an edited collection, producing the first scholarly book on Lodge to bring together the various aspects of his life and career. 
 
In 1913 Lodge gave the Presidential Address at the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Birmingham. Lodge's talk was on the continuity of the physical universe in the face of relativity, but Lodge - physicist and engineer; scientist and spiritualist; entrepreneur and civic leader - was himself an exemplary demonstration of continuity. A century later, this research network will reappraise Lodge's career, tracing the connections that structured scientific practice over Lodge's lifetime and so learning how the disciplines might be restructured today.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is designed to reach partners beyond the academy while also engaging the wider public. It will have impact on the following groups:

Museum professionals. John Liffen, Curator of Communications at the Science Museum, will be part of the advisory board and participate in the workshops. The impact on heritage professionals will be in the form of knowledge exchange between the staff of the Museum and scholars from all the disciplines involved in the project. The project will lead to increased use of the Museum's collections, this research adding value to the services the Museum porvides. Working with the project will impact on the Museum's interpretation strategy, particularly with regards to the new communication galleries opening in 2014 which feature Lodge. Therefore, the project will ultimately have an impact on the Science Museum's visitors (currently around 3 million a year).
 
Archivists. The impact on archivists will also be in the form of knowledge exchange between archivists and scholars from various disciplines. Archivists at the Universities of Birmingham and Liverpool will be involved in their respective workshops, allowing them to benefit from the expertise of scholars who will in turn benefit from improved knowledge of collections. The project will also include archivists from the Institute of Engineering and Technology. Participation in the Lodge project will help archivists consider Lodge's relevance, and ways in which collections might be used in their outreach activity, by scholars, and the wider public.
 
Public lectures. Public lectures are planned in Liverpool and Birmingham, the two universities with which Lodge was connected, so that the project can have a direct impact on members of the public. The lectures will highlight Lodge's role in the history of each city, and place his scientific achievement in the context of his civic life. Each lecture will help the wider public engage with the key argument of the project, using Lodge to understand the place of science in culture. 

Exhibition. The Cadbury Research Library at the University of Birmingham will curate and host an exhibition on Lodge, drawing on the University's archival material and its collection of historical physics instruments. This activity will lead to knowledge exchange between archivists and scholars and will raise the profile of the University's collections amongst visitors. Although the exhibition will be installed on campus, it will be promoted as part of the University's programme of knowledge exchange.
 
Popularisation project. Lodge was an important populariser of science. This project will stage a recreation of a Victorian electrical demonstration. The impact on the audience will be fourfold: it will engage them with questions about the role of science in the imagined futures of the Victorians; it will encourage them to reflect on whether those futures came to pass; it will make them consider the roles of science and technology in creating our own futures; and lastly, it will alert them to the ways science is communicated, both in the present and the past. It will also have an impact through the science that it communicates to the audience. Participants will consider the value of recreations and performance as a means of communicating science.

Blog. This will have an impact on the public by providing an accessible commentary on the project. It will be fully embedded within social media, extending the reach of the project beyond the academy. The blog will be edited with a broad audience in mind, contextualising workshop material accordingly. The blog will link the project to previous work on Lodge, especially the previous conference in 1994. By publishing video of this conference (there were talks by Lodge's grandsons), the impact of this earlier activity can be extended while providing an immediate context for the current Lodge project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23860</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Birmingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Cadbury Research Library</gtr:department><gtr:description>Cadbury Research Library</gtr:description><gtr:id>F64474C6-EF2E-4810-AAEC-AC1BDA29380A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition at Civic Science: Oliver Lodge, Physics, and the Modern University 9 November 2013

The performance was itself derived from AHRC-funded research, but for this project, it was intended to round off the first workshop, at the University of Birmingham, as it coincided with its broader themes of scientific education. The audience was about 50, of which 34 filled in feedback sheets.

After the performance there was an opportunity for Q and A with the performers.

The performance was intended to get the audience to think about the history of science, the places where it is and was taught, and the importance of performance and display as pedagogical tools.

1. Firstly the project successfully worked with the extended Lodge family. Members of the family came along to workshops, learning from the various experts present, and shared what they knew about their relative. This relationship matured, leading to a family reunion to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of Raymond Lodge, at St George's Church Edgbaston on 19 September 2015. The family said that this reunion, which they planned, would not have happened without the project, and they invited the PI, Jim Mussell, to open the occasion with a lecture. There were about fourty people in attendance, a mixture of Lodge descendants and the some of the congregation at St George's. As part of the commemoration, members of the family brought along momentos, archive material and photographs to do with Lodge and the family. The University of Birmingham also brought along some of their archival materials, including some of Raymond Lodge's possessions, on him when killed at Ypres. 

2. The project began to work with members of the psychical community. Lodge was an important figure in the Society for Psychical Research and is still of much interest with the psychical community today. Members of the community (the librarian at the College of Psychic Studies and the editor of Psychic News) attended the second workshop, 'Wireless: Oliver Lodge, Science, and Spiritualism' at the Royal Society on 24 April 2014 and again at the final (extra) seminar, Oliver Lodge: Science, Pogress, and the Public at the Science Museum 8 July 2015. There was also a spiritualist presence at the Raymond Lodge commemoration, which was attended by the President of the Spiritualist National Union and Principal of Arthur Findlay College.

3. We worked closely with archivists and curators over the course of the project. Helen Fisher, an archivist at the Cadbury Research Library, curated an exhibition for our first workshop, 'Civic Science: Oliver Lodge, Physics, and the Modern University', at the University of Birmingham 9 November 2013. This then became the basis of an exhibition at the Muirhead Tower at the University of Birmingham, called 'Civic Science: Oliver Lodge and Birmingham', which ran 3 February until 18 May 2015. A similar exhibition was hosted at the University of Liverpool for delegates, of whom 38% were from outside the academy, which consisted of Lodge manuscript material from the University's collections. 

A number museum professionals came to our workshops to learn more about Lodge and his significance for their collections. The Honorary Curator of Physics from the University of Birmingham, Robert Whitworth, attended the first two of our events. A representative of Birmingham Museums Trust, Nazia Ali, also came to two. Finally, Robert Budd, curator at the Science Museum, attended the workshops and spoke at (and hosted) the final (extra) seminar, at the Science Museum, on the 8 July 2015.

4. Our public engagement activities also had impact. Of the 34 responses we received about the Victorian Science Spectacular, after the first workshop on 9 November 2013, 33 agreed or strongly agreed the performance helped them understand how science was performed in the c19th century and the same number again agreed or strongly agreed that it helped them learn more about c19th science. The two public lectures, at Birmingham and Leeds, each attracted good audiences, around 50 each. At the first, given by Graeme Gooday at Leeds Art Gallery after the fourth workshop on 6 March 2015, 32% of attendees said they were from outside the academy and all agreed or strongly agreed that they left knowing more about Lodge's life and legacy, more about life-writing, and more about science and life-writing. Unfortunately we don't have data for the second, the Cadbury Research Library Annual Lecture at the University of Birmingham, given by James Mussell on 16 March 2015. We also had a third public lecture, which was not planned as part of the project, also given by James Mussell at the Raymond Lodge commemoration (see above), which reached an audience of about 40, all of whom were from outside the academy. 

Finally, the use of alumni networks at the University of Liverpool meant that the third workshop, 'Science, Pure and Applied: Oliver Lodge, Physics, and Engineering', on 31 October 2014, attracted a number of interested members of the public. Of the 14 who stated they were outside the academy (48% of those there), all agreed or strongly agreed that they knew more about Lodge's contributions to science and engineering; more about distinctions between pure and applied science; and more about Lodge and Liverpool. 

5. Although nothing concrete has emerged yet, the project was contacted by BBC journalist Samira Ahmed who was thinking about pitching a BBC Radio 3 documentary about Oliver Lodge. We hope this project proceeds and will certainly take part if it does.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5A65BA02-9E84-4B57-A3F0-206B1D2E2DF1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings from the project are as follows:

1. The realization of genuine interdisciplinary research into Oliver Lodge. This was achieved through the workshops, which brought together literary scholars, historians, scientists, curators, archivists, historians of science, and media scholars, amongst many others, over the life of the project. The third workshop, in particular, demonstrated the diversity of our audiences. Here, for instance, 42% of those attending said they worked in the sciences or had a scientific background, compared with only 10% from the humanities. The remainder, some 48%, were from outside the academy entirely.

Our publications further demonstrate the interdisciplinarity fostered by the project. The book, currently in preparation, has contributions from literary scholars, historians, historians of science, scientists, media scholars, and a member of the clergy. The project also resulted in a journal article, published in Notes and Records of the Royal Society, which was co-written by a literary scholar and a historian of science.

2. The workshops themselves constitute achievements in their own right. Over the four workshops and extra seminar, we had 25 papers, three lectures, and four roundtables. Together, this represents the most sustained scholarly work on Lodge and his legacy since his death in 1940. The events had a large academic reach, with over 200 people signing up to attend them, and they featured scholars from the United States, Canada, and Italy, amongst others. 

3. We significantly boosted both scholarly and public awareness about Lodge and his influence. This can be seen by the numbers attending the workshops, from the contact we have had from the media (see the Impact narrative), and our work with the Lodge family (again, see the Impact narrative). The PI and another network participant published a journal article about Lodge over the course of the project and our book, currently in preparation, with further stimulate academic interest. 

The key intellectual goal of the project was to use Lodge's own disciplinary configuration - a physicist, who became known for wireless telegraphy, led one of Britain new universities, and was a famous spiritualist - to interrogate our own. Each of these three achievements, in its own way, demonstrates that interdisciplinary work is necessary to understand the disciplinary conditions of the past, while, at the same time, showing what Lodge has to teach us about the historical relationships between different types of knowledge.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In raising the awareness of Lodge and his work, we have ensured that the findings of the project will be taken on and used by others. Already scholars who had not previously worked on Lodge are now developing substantial research projects that discuss him or take him as their focus. Our publications, the journal article and the book (in progress) are part of this broader contribution to scholarship and will, in turn, produce scholarly responses in their own right. 

The findings might also be taken forward by the museum professionals, curators, and archivists we engaged with over the course of the project. We have good links with archivists at the Universities of Birmingham and Liverpool and with curators at the University of Birmingham and the Science Museum. The exhibitions and public engagement events run as part of the project have had a large reach (around 200 people attended the lectures and engagement events alone) and, from our feedback, have enhanced people's understanding of Lodge, science, popularization and disciplinarity.

Finally, the blog and twitter accounts remain active and will act to coordinate research and activity that results from the network now the funded period of the project has ended. They will be particularly useful as the book comes together and we plan further actviity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4ADD4C78-5E85-4B53-A9AD-67E0B74F4EA5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.oliverlodge.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/56DBD68A-8492-48EC-BDC3-EC8B882B1EFB"><gtr:id>56DBD68A-8492-48EC-BDC3-EC8B882B1EFB</gtr:id><gtr:title>CONSERVATIVE ATTITUDES TO OLD-ESTABLISHED ORGANS: OLIVER LODGE AND PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Notes and records of the Royal Society of London</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1277b55b117bdf4f8695242349bb9c3f"><gtr:id>1277b55b117bdf4f8695242349bb9c3f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clarke I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0035-9149</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K006223/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>74EEC753-2C21-48E1-B2FC-60AC0E6DF312</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/K006223/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>25907.08</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>E33CC484-C028-4018-B216-9E1B8DACBD6D</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/K006223/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>23860.99</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
