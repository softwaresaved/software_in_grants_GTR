When someone gets pneumonia the lungs do not function as they ought to and this can interfere with the body getting the oxygen it needs. When this is happening additional oxygen given to the child can make a big difference and can help to save lives. The problem is that oxygen is typically not available in developing countries, where most children die. Supplies are expensive and logistically difficult and this prevents children getting oxygen. This project aims to overcome the barriers to children getting oxygen by developing a delivery system that will work despite problems such as unreliable power supplies, poor maintenance and inaccessible locations. More details about the project can be found here: http://www.insight.mrc.ac.uk/2013/03/26/no-child-should-die-for-lack-of-oxygen/</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Deaths from pneumonia, the leading killer of children globally, can be prevented with oxygen, but lack of reliable supplies in developing countries stops them getting it. This project aims to improve access to oxygen using novel sustainable solutions.
The objective is to develop an oxygen (O2) delivery system for use in resource-limited settings that will operate 24/7 with little or no maintenance and limited or absent mains power - no such solution currently exists. We propose to develop and field test a 24/7 oxygen system incorporating oxygen concentrator technology and power storage, and independently power it using solar power where no power is available. With such a product lifesaving treatment could reach those for whom it is currently beyond reach, and do so at a much lower cost than traditional oxygen cylinders.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>World Health Organization (WHO)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:department>Child and Adolescent Health</gtr:department><gtr:description>Management of severe childhood pneumonia including oxygen therapy</gtr:description><gtr:id>F8C38E37-D704-4C95-B8CD-43B7D65A4E8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications: 20937173; 20522295; 19876543; 19383191; 18235890; 20937173.
