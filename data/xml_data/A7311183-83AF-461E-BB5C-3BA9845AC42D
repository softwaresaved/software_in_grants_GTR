These technology challenges will be met through a multi-disciplinary partnership, working across institutions, across sciences, and across academia and business to create and apply innovative solutions that we need. Building on the existing links between WMG (Warwick Manufacturing Group) at Warwick and IIT-KGP, the agreement sets out an exciting agenda of future R&amp;amp;D collaboration and the creation of 'cells' for IIT-KGP at WMG and for WMG at Kharagpur as a focus for exploitation. WMG and IIT-KGP will focus their partnership initially on three themes of economic, environmental and quality-of-life importance to India and the UK: low-carbon vehicles, medical technology and ICT/e-security. This proposal seeks support for travel costs for the WMG research theme leads for the three themes, and lead academics in their teams to work at IIT-KGP. Research funding is covered by existing grants and, in particular, industrial funding for collaborative programmes. The seed corn funding sought in the Overseas Travel Grant proposal will support the travel costs of academic staff and lead researchers at WMG to travel to IIT-KGP to develop, progress and help exploit collaborative research in the three themes. Over the three year period approximately 35 visits to IIT-KGP will be supported, each of typically a week's duration. Research will be undertaken by existing and new research students and researchers. The Initiative will be self sustaining after EPSRC funding completes with full links having been established between the research teams and funds to continue collaboration being sought through industry and government sponsored research projects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary: The three themes of low-carbon vehicle, medical technology and ICT/e-security are closely integrated in the IIT-KGP: WMG vision. These fields are of current strategic importance to both countries. We expect many radical and innovative research and commercialisation opportunities to emerge at the interface areas between themes, as well as in the main theme areas. Each institution has many existing collaborators that will benefit from combined IIT- KGP/WMG knowledge and the targeted approaches to disseminate this and to enable exploitation. When individuals from IIT-KGP visit Warwick, and vice-versa, direct introductions will be made to existing collaborator companies. Direct benefits will be gained by companies collaborating in the collaborative R&amp;amp;D projects included in this partnership. Strong relationships are in place with UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) who will help us to disseminate knowledge more broadly to industry in each country. Show case events will raise commercial awareness of the technical capabilities of the two institutions in both countries, e.g. WMG exhibited its R&amp;amp;D as part of the UKTI stand at the India Auto Expo in Delhi (Jan 2010). The Overseas Travel Grant will enable the exchange of existing knowledge and the generation of new knowledge through the new collaborative R&amp;amp;D projects. With the dissemination network that we will put in place for this knowledge we expect a high impact on companies and other organisations in each country.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25051</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>105912</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>British Council</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>8A5CCB6B-F1C8-460E-9593-7BA861F3B3A5</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The major outcomes of this research are:-

The development of sustainable research links between IIT Kharagpur with 10 members of staff from Warwick having made 16 visits to India in the two year period (Profs Banerji (x2), Ceglarek (x3), Dashwood (x3), Lamberts (x1), Raja (x1), Roy (x1), Drs Bhagat (x1), Maggs (x2), Mallick (x1), and Mr Mullins (x1)) 

During these visits we have also been able to develop further research links with IIT Bhubaneswar and IIT Guwahati.

We have successfully been awarded follow on funding for two projects through the UKIERI scheme. One to establish a Thematic Network in Low Carbon Materials Technologies (with Tata Steel in India and the UK) and one to establish a joint Masters and split PhD programme.

We have submitted two proposals into the UK-India AMMMC call one in the area of additive manufacturing and one in the area of Self Resilient Manufacturing Systems. 

We have established a research internship scheme which sees 10 IIT students (from Kharagpur, Guwahati &amp;amp; Bhubaneswar) spending 8 weeks in the research groups of WMG. Associated with this we have established a scheme which awards fully funded PhD scholarships to the best of these internship students. To date we have 6 PhD students enrolled on this scheme.

Richard Dashwood has been appointed as a visiting professor at IIT Bhubaneswar.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>N/A</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9C759E59-57AD-4EDF-8AAE-2A4EA72AA84A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2E195563-1D8A-45AC-A728-DDB2E4FD7957"><gtr:id>2E195563-1D8A-45AC-A728-DDB2E4FD7957</gtr:id><gtr:title>Characterization of Tensile Properties, Limiting Strains, and Deep Drawing Behavior of AA5754-H22 Sheet at Elevated Temperature</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ebe6b860a360940b7bc0d5f46fbcf4a9"><gtr:id>ebe6b860a360940b7bc0d5f46fbcf4a9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Panicker S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E4E065C0-8802-4A36-81E7-7FCE1FF1E061"><gtr:id>E4E065C0-8802-4A36-81E7-7FCE1FF1E061</gtr:id><gtr:title>Formability analysis of pre-strained AA5754-O sheet metal using Yld96 plasticity theory: Role of amount and direction of uni-axial pre-strain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Manufacturing Processes</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d1f1bb5ca16ea8b8037c12e1ffa87160"><gtr:id>d1f1bb5ca16ea8b8037c12e1ffa87160</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dhara S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/814E3756-5D7C-4F8C-9D0D-E3D3DD60E987"><gtr:id>814E3756-5D7C-4F8C-9D0D-E3D3DD60E987</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constraint-based simulated annealing (CBSA) approach to solve the disassembly scheduling problem</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9e6bbcd06339586683efe9293adc5134"><gtr:id>9e6bbcd06339586683efe9293adc5134</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Prakash P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FA622961-409B-41ED-8F5D-93CDAFF6BA8B"><gtr:id>FA622961-409B-41ED-8F5D-93CDAFF6BA8B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Genetic-algorithms-based algorithm portfolio for inventory routing problem with stochastic demand</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Production Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d78abed5e02c02826dbb29892cb23a9e"><gtr:id>d78abed5e02c02826dbb29892cb23a9e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shukla N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I002456/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
