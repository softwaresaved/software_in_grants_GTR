Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J012785/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project addresses research, management and policy issues related to advanced technological development in driving the growth of Rising Powers, with a focus on nanotechnology in China and Russia and associated issues of institutional development, governance and global impact.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Three key research questions underpin the project:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Can breakthrough technologies be used to build or rebuild globally-competitive and high value national and regional innovation systems in China and Russia? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Can institutional, anticipatory, and governance systems adapt to address equity, responsibility and sustainability issues as breakthrough technologies are developed?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What are the implications of efforts by these Rising Powers to establish leading positions in breakthrough technologies from the view of the UK and other developed and developing countries? &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The project is implemented in partnership with the Beijing Institute of Technology (China) and the National Research University-Higher School of Economics (Russia) in conjunction with the Manchester-Atlanta-Beijing Innovation Co-Lab. The Georgia Tech Program in Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, US) is an associated partner.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will undertake bibliometric, fieldwork, and scenario analyses. An advisory board from science, business and policy will provide counsel. Outputs will include research publications, doctoral training, and workshops.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research will include business, government, universities and research sponsors, business intermediaries, local innovation organisations, researchers, and other stakeholders interested in the development of nanotechnology and other emerging technologies in rapidly growing economies and implications for the UK and other countries. 

Management insights will be developed and disseminated of value to enterprise managers, including those in advanced technology-oriented start-up and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to business support programmes, and to those who undertake investment, financial, and procurement activities with innovative SMEs. Policy insights will be developed and disseminated to UK national (e.g. BIS, TSB, NESTA) agencies and local organisations (e.g. Local Enterprise Partnerships). Our work, especially on governance issues associated with the advancement of Rising Powers technological capabilities, will be of interest to organisations engaged in responsible innovation in the UK and elsewhere. We anticipate that interest in our findings will extend beyond the UK, including to the European Commission, the OECD, the US, China, Russia, and other countries. Methodological techniques (for developing business and policy intelligence about emerging technology development in Rising Powers such as China and Russia) will be of benefit to users in the academic and non-academic worlds, including other researchers, students, management analysts, and consultancies. 

The user groups will benefit from the research if the findings from the project stimulate changes in management strategy and policy awareness and actions that result in (a) improved competitive strategies for UK-based advanced technology enterprises, especially as related to Rising Powers such as China and Russia; and (b) improved understanding of research priorities, institutions, policies, barriers, opportunities, and innovation system dynamics in China and Russia leading to additional research and innovation linkages between UK organisations and companies with these two countries. Major changes in management strategy and policy take time and effort; the contributions of this project to such changes will be through new knowledge generation, the international comparative elements (learning is often facilitated through comparison), the development of clear and actionable recommendations, the new information sources and methodologies developed, training activities and the development of a new cadre of young researchers (in the UK linked with Chinese and Russian peers) with research capabilities on international emerging technology and governance issues, and the active dissemination of results to the user groups directly (workshops and events) and indirectly (papers, media, blogs, web presence, and linkages with other organizations). The project will result in a significant deepening of collaboration between three leading innovation research institutes (in Manchester, Beijing and Moscow) providing a base and network for further research, training, and policy analysis.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>329302</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Two infographic panels (developed by Philip Shapira, Abdullah G&amp;ouml;k and Chao Li) formed part of the hands-on exhibition Graphene: A New Age at the Universeum in Gothenburg, Sweden.

We accomplished this by successfully organizing and delivering the Manchester International Summer School on Emerging Technologies, June 8-13, 2014. The Summer School provided advanced training, researcher development, and networking opportunities for early career researchers interested in real-time research and innovation systems assessment, new methods, frameworks of responsible research and innovation, and policy development for transformative emerging technologies. Among the emerging technologies we considered graphene and synthetic biology. The Summer School was attended by 29 doctoral and early career researchers (selected from more than 80 applicants) from 11 countries. Several of the student participants also came from our Rising Powers project partners (BIT, HSE, &amp;amp; Georgia Tech) and from Manchester. About a dozen faculty, from the UK, elsewhere in Europe and the US, served as instructors.

The Summer School provided participants with enhanced capabilities to conceptualize and use advanced methods of analysis to probe and anticipate research and innovation trajectories and their outcomes. Particular attention was given to strategies for linking research questions,
methods, and results with broader concerns related to research, management, and policy in emerging and convergent technology

Recognizing China as the one of the most prominent emerging economies, the seminar looked at how the Chinese market can influence the innovative activities of foreign MNCs and become a source for global innovation. Four case studies of foreign MNCs with R&amp;amp;D activities in China were presented and analyzed. These confirm an evolutionary path of foreign R&amp;amp;D activities in China from an exploitative to an explorative nature, although we move away from a framework where host countries affect MNCs' subsidiaries innovation activity based on their technological richness and diversity stepping into a context where Chinese subsidiaries can be considered as interpreters of local market characteristics, whose inputs configure unique innovation sources. The results showed how the Chinese competitive context can trigger global innovation if stimuli are properly received at both local and corporate levels.

Both of these countries have seen significant changes in their innovation systems over the past decades. From a historical perspective, these changes show significant parallels between the two countries. About 30 years ago, both countries had similar levels of investment into research, numbers of scientific publications and comparable institutions leading on research, in particular the respective national Academies of Science. Both countries have undergone periods of market reform and developed new strategic goals for their innovation policies that continue to show some similarities. For instance, both China and Russia have seen significant policy attention and government investment in nanotechnology, with business, research institutions and governments coming together in new ways to undertake research. 
Despite these similarities China appears to be more clearly on a path to becoming a world-leading country on innovation than Russia. While China has continuously improved its performance on a range of innovation indicators, Russia now lags behind. One reason seems to be that China has been more successful than Russia in overcoming the path dependence on old institutional structures of innovation shaped under central economic planning, such as administrative practices and top-down oversight. Chinese researchers are stretching institutional boundaries, for instance through involvement in start-up enterprises, and China has developed greater openness to internationalisation and talent migration. In contrast, Soviet-style institutional arrangements continue to characterise the Russian research landscape. Research activities remain strongly centralised in Moscow and around the Russian Academy of Sciences, with relatively little exchange between scientists and the private sector. Russia also promotes internationalisation of research, but mainly through cooperation with Russian scientists based abroad, with less return migration of expatriate researchers. This appears to have limited Russian success in the field of nanotechnology, as reflected in a lower growth of scientific papers and patents in the subject area compared to China or India.

Detailed key findings from the project include the following:
? Government performs central roles in the innovation systems in China and Russia (as in other Rising Powers economies). There are multiple quasi-governmental institutional forms and large-scale large-funding technological programmes. Not all of these programmes are effective, but collectively they do boost technological and economic growth. 
? Investment in R&amp;amp;D is a policy priority, particularly in China where R&amp;amp;D investment in both public and private sectors has increased dramatically in recent years. In Russia, the R&amp;amp;D system is undergoing transformation, with greater roles being assigned to leading research universities.
? Public policy and funding support accelerates entry into emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, next generation manufacturing, and synthetic biology. This is most evident in China, where the policy system more flexibly adapts to new technological priorities. 
? Our analysis of research and innovation systems in both countries has revealed some indigenous forms that do not exist in Western countries, but function relatively well in fostering innovative development (such as CAS in China, or the RVC in Russia). 
? There are evident national (and regional) characteristics of innovation systems and policies in each country. While Chinese firms learn from Western experiences, Chinese innovation strategies have differences, including co-relationships with government and the availability of financing. In Russia, there is a new focus on indigenous industrial and innovation policy and rebuilding of innovation capabilities. 
? While large national companies are powerful in both China and Russia, there is a rise in the role and influence of highly innovative SMEs in emerging and advanced technologies. This is especially evident in China. There are regional dimensions to the emergence of SME clusters, with the most innovative entrepreneurial SMEs most evident in eastern Chinese city-regions (including Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen) and in selected Russian city-regions (Including Moscow and St Petersburg).
? National and sectoral systems of innovation have distinct and not necessarily complementary policy demands. They do not co-exist with one another effortlessly, and complementarity between them is not assured. 
? Universities are evolving in their academic entrepreneurship efforts into a much broader and far-reaching set of initiatives, which incorporate a greater number of actors and stakeholders. In fostering academic entrepreneurship, path plasticity (the ability to be flexible and stretch across path dependencies) is important and is seen most strongly in China, with some early evidence in Russia about new approaches to academic innovation entrepreneurship.
? Processes of foresight, road mapping and planning remain strong in science and technology domains in both China and Russia. While regulatory frameworks are developed in both countries, as yet early consideration of societal aspects and responsible research and innovation in emerging technologies is not explicitly embedded. 
? Innovation policy assessment processes in both China and Russia are often fuzzy and evaluations are not clearly defined or undertaken. There is a lot of experimentation and institutional entrepreneurship, especially in China but increasingly in Russia. 
? Developing early stage researchers and innovators is key to fostering innovative knowledge-based systems. China has been able to do this strongly, with significant effects in research and innovation outcomes. Russia has suffered from a relative weakening in its support for early stage researchers and innovators, but is now paying policy and programme attention to this aspect. 

For the UK, the evolution in Rising Power innovation systems and their engagement in new technologies presents new collaboration opportunities although it also heightens competition for leadership and global market success in emerging and advanced technologies. This is especially the case for China, which is seeing the largest growth in emerging technologies. There are opportunities for collaboration in nanotechnology as well as in other areas of innovation, including synthetic biology, bioinformatics, medical therapies, digital manufacturing, and green goods technologies. These opportunities are also present in Russia and other Rising Powers economies, at a lesser but still significant scale. UK collaborative efforts need to be founded on an understanding of respective national strategies in these technologies and on national and international governance approaches. Exchange and mobility among researchers and innovators is key. As the UK navigates a period of reconfiguration in its migration, scientific collaboration, research funding systems, and in its trading relationships, it will be increasingly important to consider how UK researchers and innovators can continue to be supported in, and motivated to engage with, international collaborations, including with Rising Powers economies. This includes ensuring that the UK is open to scientific exchange and mobility, as well as how more UK-based researchers and innovators can gain experience and networks in Rising Powers economies. As Rising Powers economies globalise, enhancing, the attractiveness of the UK for long-term knowledge-intensive foreign inward investment from these countries will be vital, as will corresponding efforts to support mutually-beneficial UK investment in innovative sectors in Rising Powers economies. UK universities are, and can be, bridges in forging these relationships, as seen in programmes, campuses and joint ventures between UK universities and Chinese counterparts, and in the growth of international research students within the UK. There are latent opportunities for UK small and medium-sized innovative enterprises (SMEs) to engage with innovative businesses and markets in China and, to a lesser extent (given current sanctions and restrictive internal policies) with Russia. However, UK SMEs would benefit from greater collaborative support, from UK public, private and third-sector organizations, to tackle these Rising Powers markets.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have been communicated through workshops, briefs, blogs, social media, and peer-reviewed papers. Additionally, we are contributing in a leadership role to a further major international policy conference on the Rising Powers in Manchester in June 2017. The findings we have developed will be of use for for policymakers, business, researchers, and other intermediaries interested and involved in innovation systems change in emerging economies such as China and Russia. Insights about implications for the UK are of particular interest given increased UK needs to develop and strengthen trade and investment relationships with Rising Powers economies and to ensure the competitiveness of the UK knowledge-intensive economy. Specific findings related to particular technologies, including nanotechnology and graphene, are useful for those involved in research and innovation in these technologies, and also offer insights for the latest round of emerging technologies including synthetic biology.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E7D3CAE0-096A-460A-8CA3-A10C71A04910</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.risingpowers.net/projects/innovationsystems/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FAE1ED51-E9E4-421B-854F-52D0A79C5A8D"><gtr:id>FAE1ED51-E9E4-421B-854F-52D0A79C5A8D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Academic Entrepreneurship in Russia and China</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bd75dbe105014309cbdded985198a393"><gtr:id>bd75dbe105014309cbdded985198a393</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1B062DD9-46E2-45A9-B761-9C9CBF91DE2E"><gtr:id>1B062DD9-46E2-45A9-B761-9C9CBF91DE2E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Knowledge Institutions in Transitional States</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d1c4d69a0cf6307416efc8ea2dad4c50"><gtr:id>d1c4d69a0cf6307416efc8ea2dad4c50</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shackleton, O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3B6A8179-E955-4FA5-ADB3-0B19933DE04F"><gtr:id>3B6A8179-E955-4FA5-ADB3-0B19933DE04F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nanotechnology Research and Innovation in China: Country Profile</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4033da93bf4a4c9c9f522e01a8f6eb8a"><gtr:id>4033da93bf4a4c9c9f522e01a8f6eb8a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ren, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/530E768B-29F3-4957-991B-B1AC612F32FA"><gtr:id>530E768B-29F3-4957-991B-B1AC612F32FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>How international is internationally colloborated research?
