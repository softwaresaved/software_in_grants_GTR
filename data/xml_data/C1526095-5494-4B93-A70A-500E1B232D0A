The introduction of atoms of small radius into holes (interstices) within an array of metal atoms has a profound effect on the host metal properties such as hardness and electrical conductivity. For example, the hardness and strength of steel are due to the interstitial carbon atoms within iron, similarly titanium nitride (TiN) is widely used in dental and medical implants due to the hardness and corrosion resistance imparted by the interstitial nitrogen atoms. Interstitial phosphides have properties with industrial and academic importance, for example, NiMoP has been studied as a diffusion barrier and seed layer for Cu in electronics and CrNiP is an itinerant ferromagnet. At present no general protocol exists for the synthesis of mixed interstitial nitride-phosphide compounds. In this proposal, funding is requested for the synthesis and structural and magnetic characterisation of transition metal nitride phosphides that have potential applications as hard materials, heterogeneous catalysts, and permanent magnets. The proposed synthesis will give control over metal stoichiometry and interstitial count. This represents an advance on previous methods because of the potential for tuning of physical properties both by intimate control of the metal stoichiometry and by interstitial count.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The two major direct beneficiaries of this work are the academic community and industry. The proposed work will have an impact on those in a range of academic disciplines, including, but not limited to, chemistry and physics, materials science, mechanical and electrical engineering. Many of the applications of this work mean that those who collaborate with the academic community in these areas will also benefit. The proposed materials are applicable in a number of sectors of industry; the principal benefits are technological, commercial, and environmental. The potential technological impact of the proposed work is immense because these materials have possible uses in very diverse settings; the proposed synthesis promises to yield crystalline powders suitable for processing into devices for many applications. At present it is estimated that between 50 and 70% of all cutting tips are nitride coated; the hardness and durability imparted by this to tools has enormous economic impact. The proposed compounds should have hardness in line with the best interstitial nitrides and carbides known. Where a suitable processing regime can be developed (for example production of a coating with a binder), these solids have potential to impact on any industry where hardness is important, including defence, mining, and drilling. At present cutting tools are frequently coated with tungsten carbide within a cobalt matrix, but both tungsten and cobalt are considered strategic metals. This work offers the possibility to transform the range of materials used at present and replace them with those of lower cost, better availability, and improved hardness. Much of the development of heterogeneous catalysts employed by industry is done by exhaustive testing of materials and optimisation of microstructure to yield high surface area species. Activity is then balanced against cost and catalyst stability. The application of catalysts in processes such as hydrodenitrogenation and hydrodesulfurization which improve the quality of fuels is of massive economic importance. The phases targeted in this work have similar metals and structural features and therefore would be expected to display broadly similar catalytic activity, but the presence of a second interstitial may prove crucial in enhancing catalytic activity. One potential impact is the development of heterogeneous catalysts with enhanced activity that reduce the need for heating in industrial processes, with obvious environmental benefits and give increased efficiency in synthesis. Both of these would have a direct impact on the profitability of any process employing the catalyst. Much of the modern electronics industry seems to be removed from simple synthetic chemistry but the electronics revolution owes a great deal to synthetic solid state chemistry. For example, Blu-ray laser devices, rewritable optical media, hard drives, and iPod headphones are all derived from solid state devices. The range of applications that employ permanent magnets is staggering; these include hard disk drives, mobile phones, and hybrid electric vehicles. The proposed materials may have impact as tuneable magnetic solids. Materials in which there is co-existence of electrical conductivity and magnetic order have applications in high-tech industries, particular in the field of data storage. It is difficult to predict application of specific target compounds in this fast moving field, but clearly materials that have electronic and magnetic properties that can be tuned by small changes in the number of interstitials or in the metals present, will be applicable in electronic devices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102631</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Structure of Chinese Milk Contaminant Determined</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3E1DFD0-A833-40B9-8FF4-E9860CC1625D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article highlighting importance of this discovery to the food industry.
