All the above ground parts of the plant are ultimately derived from these primordia. Most plants grow vegetatively first, making stems and leaves, before initiating flowering. In the laboratory we study the development of a small plant called Arabidopsis. Although it is just a weed, Arabidopsis has many advantages for scientists to work on it, and we believe that what we learn about Arabidopsis will be relevant to many other plants. When arabidopsis grows, the first 15 or so primordia that are initiated are vegetative, that is they make leaves. After this time, if the conditions are right, the plant will make flowers instead of leaves. This developmental decision to make leaves or flowers is very important, and controlled by many factors. We want to understand more clearly how the switch from making leaves to making flowers works in plants. We have identified a mutant, fdp-1, where the switch is damaged, and as a result the plants make flowers much earlier than they should. Indeed, in the fdp-1 mutant, many genes are expressed where and when they shouldn't be. This gene therefore represents an exciting tool to understand in molecular terms aspects of how plants control the switch from making leaves to flowers in the primodia. We shall use a combination of different approaches to understand this problem. We wish to discover what other genes are affected by FDP. We will do this using microarrays. We also wish to discover the mechanism of FDP signaling, is it direct, or does it act through a repressor? Finally, we wish to do genetic screens to identify other genes involved.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A critical question in biology concerns how developmental switches work to control growth and morphogenesis. We have identified an essential component necessary for floral repression, FDP. FDP encodes a bZIP transcription factor, and loss of function alleles display early and terminal flowers and show massive misregulation of floral meristem identity genes such as AGAMOUS and APETALA1. During vegetative growth FDP is expressed in the sites of the future axillary meristems and in the centre of the apical meristem. Following the floral transition, FDP expression becomes restricted to the centre of the shoot apical meristem. FDP interacts by 2-hybrid and genetically with the well characterised floral repressor TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1).We will characterise the nature of the interaction of FDP and TFL1 in vivo. To understand the global effects of fdp-1 on development, we will identify its transcriptional targets. Putative cis-regulatory elements will be identified and analysed in vivo. Protein domain analysis and cell based assays will be used to verify if FDP acts as a direct transcriptional repressor. A forward genetic screen based on the strong fdp-1 phenotype will be used to identify additional players in the FDP pathway.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>255987</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We discovered a regulatory network that controls how and when plants flower. Using computer simulations, we are able to model how the signals that make a plant flower rise as the plant grows and develops, and we can understand the timing of flowering and how and why some plant cells become flower cells while other cells remain vegetative.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Understanding how plants flower is important in many agricultural contexts. Our use of simple network logic has been taken up by the community and many people have used our methods for understanding crop plants. This is highlighted in a recent review (Current Opinion in Biotechnology
Volume 32, April 2015, Pages 121-129). In the context of Agbiotech, the antagonistic relationship between FT and TFL1 in controlling the floral transition suggests that by modifying their relative activities it will be possible to directly control flowering traits in crop plants.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3EC8177F-B276-4843-89D8-8D9F89FE8433</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17447012</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6AEAA845-31F3-4D3E-A96C-E0D8F375A0D3"><gtr:id>6AEAA845-31F3-4D3E-A96C-E0D8F375A0D3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interlocking feedback loops govern the dynamic behavior of the floral transition in Arabidopsis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Plant cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/97b9f8cf0c55c71672f594e39c7ef197"><gtr:id>97b9f8cf0c55c71672f594e39c7ef197</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jaeger KE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1040-4651</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0228B0FF-BCDB-4005-9B98-8EE46BA7E2B7"><gtr:id>0228B0FF-BCDB-4005-9B98-8EE46BA7E2B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Simple network motifs can capture key characteristics of the floral transition in Arabidopsis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant signaling &amp; behavior</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4ba1b37c549799d7f022f7717afa6938"><gtr:id>4ba1b37c549799d7f022f7717afa6938</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pullen N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1559-2316</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D010047/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
