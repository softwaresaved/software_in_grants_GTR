Variations of the concept of reasonable adjustment, which first gained prominence in the US, have been adopted in the disability legislation of many countries in the past fifteen years. EU Member States are obliged by the General Framework Equal Treatment Directive (2000/78/EC) to introduce such duties in the employment sphere by the end of 2006 at the very latest. In some jurisdictions reasonable adjustments duties are not restricted to disability but extend to all areas of anti-discrimination law.

The concept of reasonable adjustment has thus been on the UK statute book for a decade. It is charged with a vital and apparently novel role in the promotion of the equality and inclusion of disabled people in mainstream UK society. Reasonable adjustment duties will frequently require employers, service providers and others to spend money and have therefore been greeted with some concern from such quarters. Further, their requirements to treat people differently in order to avoid discrimination claims raise challenging questions about our conceptions of equality and difference. Similar requirements to treat people differently in order to take account of their particular circumstances (e.g. physical impairment) also emerge from human rights law.

Practical guidance as to the implications of reasonable adjustment duties has been provided in Codes of Practice and disputes as to their implications have received judicial attention. In Archibald v Fife Council [2004] UKHL 32, indeed, the reasonable adjustments issue reached the House of Lords and, though the result has been generally welcomed, aspects of the reasoning are somewhat perplexing.

A detailed analysis of the role and function of reasonable adjustments in the UK is therefore timely. Further, with the move towards a single Commission for Equality and Human Rights and also towards a more unified approach to the various grounds protected by anti-discrimination law (on which the recently appointed Discrimination Law Review is currently working), the possible extension of reasonable adjustments duties beyond disability has become an important issue. Potential developments of this kind intensify the need for clarity of understanding as to the distinctive nature and function of the concept.

Aims and Objectives

The aims and objectives of this research are to enhance knowledge and understanding of:

The distinctive role and function of the reasonable adjustment duties imposed by UK anti-discrimination law and of their potential development and reform;
the relationship between such duties and analogous duties emerging from human rights law; and the relationship between reasonable adjustment duties and underlying conceptions of equality, diversity and participation which appear to shape anti-discrimination law.

Potential Applications and Benefits

This work will contribute to academic debate in the area of equality law. It will also help to inform those responsible for developing and applying law and policy in the UK. It may therefore contribute to the formulation of rules and principles which are coherent, effective and fair the number of people potentially affected by it could therefore be enormous</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25998</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E504809/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>05111DBD-D3AB-4CEB-B45C-DD5885F4C460</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>84FAE587-7A8D-4EE4-9939-EE9AFF202021</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law Regulated By Statute</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
