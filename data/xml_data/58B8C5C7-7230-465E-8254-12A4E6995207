This will be achieved over a two year period by updates and improvements to the Sun|trek site (and related iSun|trek site) and by actively promoting Sun|trek, in particular the classroom resources and projects available for schools, more widely across the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland) and Ireland. The wider aim is to enhance the UK resources available to teachers, which can be used to enthuse students about solar astronomy and to encourage students to study the physical sciences at sixth form and beyond. Particular efforts will be made to target inner city schools (with diverse ethnic groups) for example in Birmingham, Leicester, Bedford, London and Slough. As an example, the recent inspirational video interviews with ethnic minority scientists by Benjamin Zephaniah were posted on Sun|trek facebook. In addition, as many females as possible are used as role models on Sun|trek (see solar guides). The legacy will be the provision of resources, but also the involvement of young solar researchers to continue their own outreach work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Sun|trek website and classroom resources will be advertised widely in the UK and internationally via talks at teachers' conferences, visits to schools, talks to astronomy groups, NAM/RAS meetings, articles in popular and schools magazines, the press, and via the media. In addition, links and connections will be established via social communications networks and websites specifically dedicated to resources for schools (Schoolsscience, STEM resources, UKSA, ESA, ESERO etc). The network of STFC science communicators is important as a way of sharing ideas and best practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9200</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UK Space Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UK Space Agency</gtr:description><gtr:id>550291D7-C4E6-41EE-B9BA-1486A7AEE093</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increased interaction with UK schools, teachers and students.

Recent engagement has been with Tim Peake's mission on the ISS. Collaboration on a UK Space Agency website: Space2earth Challenge, and many visits to schools.

Exciting, new and diverse methods were used with these projects, which the students enjoyed very much, and learnt a lot from. The ideas and content are being developed and shared with teachers throughout the UK.

This has been successfully achieved by working directly with schools throughout the UK, engaging teachers at CPD days (ESERO, IoP, ASE etc), giving talks locally and nationally, media exposure (BBC TV and radio), running sessions at NAM to engage young researchers. In addition, full use has been made of social networking through Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Sun|trek (www.suntrek.org) has been upgraded with new information, classroom projects, and links to the UK curriculum. Several new articles have been provided for iSun|trek. The Sun|trek classroom projects have been uploaded onto the UK STEM website, making them more accessible to UK teachers. Other members of the public have been reached through talks and prestigious lectures, including at the Ri, and by media exposure (BBC TV and radio).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>51B821B6-5594-46DD-BF12-D318C9597177</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the Sun|trek project and associated STFC grant is to contribute towards the enrichment of educational resources for UK schools.
