There is an urgent need for neuroprotective agents that could be used early to slow disease progression, but none currently exist. The major barrier is the difficulty of early diagnosis (when agents are most likely to be effective) and the lack of robust biomarkers (to measure drug efficacy). Thus the prospect of non-invasive early diagnosis and therapy monitoring using new medical imaging technologies is compelling. 

In this project we plan to develop a radically new diagnostic imaging method, called Zero-Field (ZF) MRI. Due to its ability to use interactions that are completely masked at the high magnetic fields used by normal MRI scanners, ZF-MRI should have exquisite sensitivity to molecular changes in brain tissue, bringing the possibility of early diagnosis. The challenge is to develop imaging technology that will enable pre-symptomatic diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases associated with abnormal protein aggregation, particularly Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

In our recent research we have developed technology and methods of a new type of MRI called Fast Field-Cycling MRI (FFC-MRI). In this technique (which requires very special magnets, power supplies and control electronics) the magnetic field is switched rapidly between levels, always returning to the same field for signal detection. In ZF-MRI the magnetic field will be held at zero for part of the procedure, during which time the special zero-field interactions will take place. In this manner, the resulting images of the brain will contain information about brain structure and function at the molecular and cellular levels, which has hitherto been invisible to MRI.

Work will be carried out using an existing human-sized FFC-MRI scanner that we have built in our laboratories. In order to employ it fr ZF-MRI we will devise methods to cancel the Earth's field within the volume of the scanner, using cancellation coils along with the scanner's shim coils. New techniques will be developed to measure and minimise the residual magnetic field. Several magnetic resonance phenomena are known to exist at zero field and we will develop methods to exploit them for enhanced diagnosis. They include, for example, the tiny magnetic fields generated by atoms within protein molecules. These magnetic fields are insignificant compared to the very strong magnetic fields used in conventional hospital MRI scanners. However, by operating at zero magnetic field (for part of the scanning procedure) ZF-MRI will be exceptionally sensitive to changes in these magnetic fields, and hence to the tissue structure and content. 

Tests of ZF-MRI will be carried out using tissue-mimicking test samples made of gels and other chemicals, then protein aggregates of the kind we expect to encounter in patients' brains, followed by pre-clinical studies. This will allow us to determine the sensitivity of ZF-MRI to subtle changes in tissue composition and molecular dynamics. Later in the project we will scan patients (subject to ethical approval) who are known to have neurodegenerative conditions, together with normal volunteers, and will compare the results obtained from ZF-MRI with brain scans obtained on our 3-tesla conventional MRI scanner.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
* Patients with a range of neurodegenerative medical conditions.
* Hospital radiology departments and neurology departments.
* Universities, research institutes and hospitals conducting research into MRI, neuroradiology and neurodegenerative disease.
* Pharmaceutical companies developing new drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.
* Large medical imaging companies which manufacture and supply MRI systems.
* Smaller companies (SMEs) supplying components to medical imaging companies.
* Research staff working on the project.

How will the beneficiaries benefit from this research?
The research has the potential to detect changes in the brain arising from neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and to do so at a significantly earlier stage of the disease than is possible with present diagnostic imaging technology. Patients will benefit from earlier diagnosis, leading to earlier and more effective treatment. In this way the research will contribute to the health and wellbeing of the general population. 
Hospitals will benefit from the ability to diagnose and treat neurodegenerative conditions earlier than before.
Universities and research institutes will benefit from having at their disposal a new method of detecting changes in the brain caused by neurodegenerative disease. This will benefit research into these medical conditions.
Pharmaceutical companies will benefit from the ability to measure biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease, in turn informing them about the effectiveness of neuroprotective agents, or of drugs to halt or reverse neurodegeneration.
Manufacturers of MRI systems will benefit from increased sales of MRI systems. Companies could manufacture dedicated ZF-MRI scanners, and there is also the potential for them to produce add-on hardware to enable ZF-MRI to be implemented on some existing MRI scanners, which are capable of being upgraded by the add-on field-cycling hardware. Companies supplying ZF-MRI scanners would benefit from the increased exposure in the market that association with the novel technique will bring.
Research staff working on the project will benefit from working with novel diagnostic technology, and from direct contacts with clinical and biomedical researchers. The project will enhance research staff members' knowledge, and will make them more employable, in universities, research institutes, hospitals and industry.

When will the benefits arise?
The research staff will benefit throughout the period of the project, and after it has finished due to the extra skills and knowledge gained. MRI manufacturers will benefit as soon as they are able to bring the product to market, typically 2-5 years after the project end. Hospitals and other users of the technology will benefit once the ZF-MRI technology is installed in their institute, 2-5 years after completion of the project. Patients will start to benefit as soon as the technology is installed in hospitals and research institutes, and the benefit to these communities will increase as the number of ZF-MRI scanners increases over the following 5-10 years. With more ZF-MRI scanners in use, knowledge about their benefits will spread among the potential user community, further increasing the number of units sold, to the benefit of manufacturers, users and society at large.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>979173</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>CEA-Leti</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Multi-partner collaboration on Aberdeen-led H2020 project, &amp;quot;IDentIFY&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>A082885B-B7A0-4654-97FE-BDD96F809CE4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A number of conference abstracts have been published.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaborative research, which led to the joint preparation, and subsequent award, of a multi-partner EU Horizon 2020 grant (Project &amp;quot;IDentIFY&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Enhancing Diagnosis by Fast Field-Cycling MRI&amp;quot;, Grant Agreement 668119, EUR 6.60m, 48 months from January 2016, led by the University of Aberdeen (Lurie)).

The work on ultra-low field FFC-MRI carried out during this award was important in putting together a multidisciplinary consortium of researchers, led by the University of Aberdeen, which succeeded in obtaining funding from the EU for a Horizon 2020 research project on FFC-MRI, aimed at taking the technology closer to clinical use. The consortium includes 7 academic teams and two SMEs. 

Our work, and the resulting increased exposure and awareness of the medical applications of relaxometry and FFC-MRI at extremely low magnetic fields, contributed to the award of an EU-funded &amp;quot;COST Action&amp;quot; on relaxometry, &amp;quot;European Network on NMR Relaxometry&amp;quot; (COST Action CA15209).

Previous work in our laboratory had demonstrated the sensitivity of FFC-MRI to a number of disease states, including osteoarthritis (changes in cartilage could be measured) and thrombosis (the blood clotting process could be monitored). This led us to hypothesise that abnormal proteins called tau and amyloid, known to be associated with AD, could be detectable by FFC-MRI. 
The key technological goals of the project, which were mainly achieved were concerned with optimising aspects of the FFC-MRI scanner's hardware and software and developing methods to extend measurements to extremely low magnetic fields, even below the value of the earth's magnetic field. To this end, methods to characterise reliably the environmental magnetic field within the scanner were developed and techniques to counteract or offset those magnetic fields were investigated, including the construction of large, three-axis field-offset coils surrounding the scanner. Improved techniques for cancelling environmental fields, applicable to this project, were also developed under a separately-funded PhD research project. In addition, novel software solutions were devised in order to correct for artefacts (errors) in FFC-MRI images that can arise due to instability of the scanner's magnetic field.
Despite the technological progress, efforts to demonstrate the sensitivity of FFC-MRI or Zero-Field MRI to neurodegenartive changes in the brain have so far been unsuccessful. It is thought that this might be because the preclinical disease models employed, although useful in some areas of brain research, may not mimic sufficiently well the changes in brain tissues arising from actual diseases such as AD. at least as far as the FFC-MRI signals are concerned. It is also possible that the anticipated protein-related signals were not observed in preclinical models because these were whole-brain studies, while the primary changes are expected to occur in localised regions of the brain; thus, there may have been a &amp;quot;dilution&amp;quot; of the effect. We are close to being able to test the FFC-MRI scanner on patients who suffer from neurodegenerative conditions; it is possible that the hypothesised sensitivity of FFC-MRI and ZF-MRI to these conditions may be revealed only in scans of the brains of living human subjects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has developed into an indispensible diagnostoic tool, with 10s of thousands of scanners in use every day around the world to diagnose disease in patients. It has already been demonstrated by us that Fast Field-Cycling MRI (FFC-MRI) can detect disease-induced changes in the body in a number of conditions (albeit not yet in neurodegenerative conditions). The technological advancements achieved during this project have brought FFC-MRI and its variant Zero-Field MRI (ZF-MRI) significantly closer to devices that could be used for clinical diagnosis in hospitals. The technology can therefore potentially benefit medical professionals and patients, by providing a new diagnostic tool that is complementary to existing non-invasive methods. The medical imaging manufacturing industry may benefit from the exploitation of this new technology, and ultimately from sales in the health sector.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8E9CB0B8-C388-46DA-BE77-7A45A240F2E1</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ffc-mri.org/publications.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset contains the data created for the development of the two-points method.
