These sounds, which are known as otoacoustic emissions, are of great scientific interest and potentially huge clinical importance. They provide an objective measure of inner ear function, and are highly relevant to a form of hearing loss that affects over 8 million people in the UK. The project will fund animal experiments (performed on rodents) which will compare the otoacoustic emissions evoked by various combinations of sounds with the mechanical events that are evoked in the inner ear by the same sounds. We will use a purpose-built laser interferometer to monitor the sound-evoked motion of membranes in various parts of the inner ear, and we will combine this with the use of novel combinations of acoustic stimuli to allow us to distinguish between the motion patterns of sounds travelling ?into? and ?out of? the ear. This will allow us to determine exactly where the otoacoustic emissions are produced within the ear, and should lead to significant improvements in the way that we understand the normal ear to function. The mechanisms that we will study, including both the amplification and reflection of sound within the inner ear, are likely to be almost identical to those occurring in humans. The project should therefore be of direct relevance to human hearing. The main outcomes of the study will be reported in internationally-respected scientific journals, and presented at joint scientific and medical conferences in the UK and abroad. The knowledge created during the project will also be incorporated into public presentations about hearing and deafness.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project aims to explore the cochlear mechanical basis of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs: sounds that are generated within the inner ear, but measurable in the external auditory meatus; OAEs presently provide objective tests of hearing in both neonate and adult clinics). We will test several hypotheses concerning the cochlear mechanical bases of OAEs using new, systematic measurements of OAEs and of basilar- and/or tectorial-membrane motion in the cochlea. Two of the hypotheses to be tested differ only in the way that the OAEs are presumed to propagate out of the cochlea following their generation: one hypothesis relies on reverse propagation via a differential pressure wave travelling along the basilar membrane, while the other relies on a compression wave travelling directly through the fluids of the cochlea. These hypotheses predict measurably different delays for the OAEs, and can therefore be tested directly by comparing the delays of the OAEs with those of the associated intra-cochlear events. Our new measurements of basilar- and tectorial-membrane motion will determine exactly where the OAEs originate in the cochlea, and will distinguish between forwards and backwards travelling waves by comparing responses across different stimulus configurations; e.g. comparing the response patterns to two-tone distortion products with those to single tone stimuli, both with and without external ?suppressor? tones. Another OAE-related theory that will be tested involves the multiple internal reflection of sound energy along the cochlear partition. This theory will be tested by measuring mechanical responses to sounds, as well as OAEs, under conditions where the reflectance of the cochlear partition and/or the middle-ear is altered by mass loading. To reduce confusion caused by response variations across ears, all experiments will involve measurements of both acoustic and mechanical responses in the same ears. Measurements will be made in three animal models of human hearing. Mechanical measurements will be made from the bases and apices of chinchilla, guinea-pig and gerbil cochleae, using a purpose-built laser interferometer, to test the possibility that different mechanisms underlie low- and high-frequency OAEs. The findings of this study will significantly improve our understanding of the way that normal ears process sound, and will have potential applications in millions of people who presently suffer from certain forms of hearing loss. Our findings will be reported in internationally-respected scientific journals and conferences, and will also be incorporated into public presentations about hearing and deafness.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93625</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B92BA3C0-BD36-4E7B-8C53-23252D8F2371"><gtr:id>B92BA3C0-BD36-4E7B-8C53-23252D8F2371</gtr:id><gtr:title>COMPARING OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS AND BASILAR MEMBRANE MOTION IN INDIVIDUAL EARS</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7869a7abac5d72857d4647194295f1b4"><gtr:id>7869a7abac5d72857d4647194295f1b4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>COOPER N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-981-283-377-8</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/55493CB1-7FB4-4C6F-85A2-F5CC5082F7BD"><gtr:id>55493CB1-7FB4-4C6F-85A2-F5CC5082F7BD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Basilar-membrane interference patterns from multiple internal reflection of cochlear traveling waves.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3fdf173145695226b1af633a6ee623d2"><gtr:id>3fdf173145695226b1af633a6ee623d2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shera CA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-4966</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0500773</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>5585DDA6-FCF6-4B64-8332-1BDFE62CE94E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ear</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
