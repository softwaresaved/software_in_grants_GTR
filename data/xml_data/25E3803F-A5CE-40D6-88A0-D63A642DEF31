Unlike other fields however, the datasets in neuroscience are very heterogeneous and often require heavy post-processing and contextual annotation. This enrichment of metadata presents a challenge in itself because any data needs to be filtered and visualised with changing situational requirements, and their high dimensionality often make these data sets unruly and difficult for traditional static visualisation techniques. 

In preliminary work (submitted), we have manually annotated, enriched and standardised a dataset of over 2000 ion channel models according to their published context and their stereotypical response to predefined test protocol. We then developed a ``big data browser'' to allow users to quickly browse all ion channel models and visualise their functional characteristics with interactive filtering. These ion channel models have become the standard in the field for creating experimentally-constrained neuron and network models. Our method provides all necessary information for users searching for specific ion channel types to narrow down the circle of candidate models and can save an individual researcher as much as 4 weeks of preliminary literature research and test simulations.

In this proposal, we aim to expand our work. Divided into three work packages, we aim to maintain and expand this resource in the context of ion channel models, as well as to make it a general case browser for neuroscience data. In WPI, we plan to expand the database to be simulator-independent and to include experimental data, making it more comprehensive and allow direct comparison of experiments to models. This will make the resource a useful tool for theorists as well as experimentalists. Next, we plan to integrate our database with other neuroscience resources, and maintain this all in one comprehensive and up-to-date platform. In this way, we can take advantage of existing frameworks and act as a complement to them.

In WPII, we aim to expand the current functionality of the database to include multi-channel dynamics, multi-compartmental models, and finally to combine these two together to allow for analysis of complex dynamics. We will use the existing framework developed in our pilot work and WPI. Our ultimate goal is to produce a tool for the complete creation and testing of neuron models with complex morphology and channel composition. This will be of great benefit to experimentally-constrained modelling, making the creation of models easier and more intuitive. Testing a hypothesis of functional deficits based on proposed ion channel disfunction or morphological aberration will only take a matter of hours instead of several weeks.

In WPIII, we aim to expand our data browser for ion channel models to other areas in neuroscience by making it a general 'Big Data Browser'. The main issue with big data currently is to create graphical interfaces that allow the exploration of complex datasets without requiring expert knowledge. We hope to create a unified interface for the storage, organisation and visualisation of datasets such as these, in order to make data more accessible and reusable. The end result will be an out-of-the-box data visualiser that can be adapted to any new dataset, and even to allow the comparison between datasets in an easy way.

In summary, our proposal will provide the field with a resource for building detailed neuron models with complex ion channel dynamics and comparing them directly to experiments. In a second step, it will also provide the field with a much-needed data interface, adaptable to any dataset, solving a field-wide problem of how to efficiently share and compare heavily annotated big data sets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We recently developed an interactive database that collects, annotates and quantifies ion channel performance. Our service lightens the time burden of looking for published models considerably and facilitates easy comparison with experiments. 

Here we propose to increase the database by ~10-fold (~1000 new channel models from 5 languages, 40'000 simulations from possible combinations of ion channels, and ~20'000 morphology models). In parallel we'll take advantage of a separable front-end-visualisation engine and back-end-data-management strategy to create an interactive, user-controlled, universally applicable data browser for any other neuroscience data. 

We will curate the existing database and collaborate with existing initiatives to allow automated integration of models and experimental data in simulator-independent formats. We will adapt the voltage-clamp protocols that were developed for NEURON and integrate them to perform a unified, simulator-free framework. We will develop new dynamic-clamp protocols to test combined ion channel dynamics. We will perform offline analysis of all (40'000) pairs of relevant channel models, and later allow online-customized, user-submitted combinations. Finally, we will utilize existing morphology datasets at ModelDB and NeuroMorpho to analyze and compare dynamics with different morphological complexities.

We will also expand the software infrastructure of our browser, modularizing the prototype to provide any database with dynamically generated in-browser visualizations. We will rewrite abstraction routines of both the database abstraction layer and the client-side visualization software to allow specifying modules and visualization via configuration files, without expert knowledge and convert the existing rendering engine to a WebGL based engine to render larger datasets. Finally, we will develop data import and configuration tools to enable the reuse of our browser for the online search and browsing of arbitrary ne</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate that our work will have substantial impact in the neuroscience community and the broader scientific community, as well as the potential to support engagement with the public and opportunities in the private sector. 

The work of the first part of this proposal will systematically illuminate the interaction of various ion channel types with each other in morphologically realistic models and thus, for the first time, create a quantifiable comparison between model and experiment. What's more, it will provide and annotated data set into which any new model or experimental result can be integrated easily, with distinct coordinates in a topology of behaviours. Our work will thus be relevant and applicable for an unusually large target audience, essentially anyone who would like to make comparative models of single neuron dynamics. 

The other main outcome of our work will be the creation of a general applicable and adaptable 'Big Data Browser' for the analysis and visualisation of complex and heavily annotated experimental and computational datasets. Given the need (and scarcity) for tools such as these to handle information management and manipulation, both in the academic context as well as in private business, we expect that our software will be marketable to the greater community. We have begun to take the necessary steps in order to pursue this option with the technology transfer offices at the University of Oxford. 

As for scientific dissemination beyond publications and even beyond social media outlets we use (e.g. facebook or twitter), we are confident that the website that we will continue to expand, and the corresponding publication, now in review, will give our project a generous amount of publicity. We will be able to continue to bolster this awareness with subsequent publications at the level of &amp;quot;Resources&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Methods&amp;quot;, but also through primary findings that will stem from the detailed comparison of experiments and models that were previously not fathomable. 

In regards to communication with the public we are excited to use our visualisation software as a demonstration tool in order to facilitate public understanding of science, especially in the domain of informatics and complex datasets, a branch of science that is often neglected for its supposed inaccessibility. We will use our already established website, as well as more local outreach in order to reach the public, especially the younger generation, whom we hope to inspire to explore a career in either bioscience, informatics, data visualization or most preferable, a combination of these for the sake of neuroscience. 

We hope to provide our big data visualisation tool to any research group or laboratory that expresses interest, in any domain of science. Finally, our proposal will support the development of stronger ties between biosciences and informatics, which is becoming increasingly important, and our staff will be trained in both disciplines, as to allow for a wide array of opportunities in the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>673700</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N019512/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1F190F7B-B800-40B2-B250-62AD4842598F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioinformatics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FA4A8455-3074-48A4-B0CD-5B85D94B79F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>eScience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
