Across Northern England and parts of Scotland, moorland burning is a traditional practice for encouraging and maintaining heather growth (75% of the world's heather cover occurs in the UK uplands). However, detailed evaluations of the costs, benefits and sustainability of burning are hampered by a lack of basic scientific data. Many moorland owners feel pressured to change what they see as traditional practice despite any convincing evidence of environmental degradation and this is causing serious tension between farmers and regulators. The problem also has major financial implications because heather burning is subsidised by the government under its environmental stewardship scheme, whilst paradoxically an estimated &amp;pound;450-630M is being spent on trying to improve the quality of water courses to meet Water Framework Directive requirements. Unsurprisingly, evaluation of burn sustainability is one of the most pressing applied ecological issues for which upland managers are requesting evidence from the scientific community. EMBER will address these issues by providing the first co-ordinated evaluation of moorland burning effects on river catchment hydrological and ecological processes. Case study sites influenced by prescribed burns will be established in internationally important SSSIs in the Peak District and North Pennines, UK. Without this research, our understanding of hydrological and ecological responses to moorland burning will remain poor, biodiversity will be at risk and these systems will potentially fail to meet EU and UK policy requirements with resultant implications for landowners. EMBER will increase understanding of the processes linking prescribed moorland burning, hydrology, water quality and stream invertebrate communities in upland peat dominated catchments. Four work packages (WP) will ai to: 1. increase understanding of the effects of moorland patch burning on the hydrology and physicochemistry of peat, through examination of changes in soil hydrology and water quality. 2. provide a better understanding of the effects of moorland patch burning on basin runoff quantity and quality, through examination of river flow regimes, suspended sediment concentration and water chemistry. 3. assess the influence of changes in stream hydrology, water quality and sediment fluxes on stream ecosystems through examination of stream invertebrate community biodiversity and fish abundance 4. gain a more fundamental understanding of some environmental drivers of upland aquatic community response to burning by experimentally manipulating fine sediment flux under controlled conditions using a series of streamside mesocosms. Taken together these packages will provide a holistic patch- to basin-scale evaluation of burning from the perspective of peat hydrology, chemistry, river water quantity and quality, and stream ecosystems, thus providing the balanced knowledge base which is currently lacking. In the longer-term we expect EMBER to act as a major reference underpinning UK moorland burning policy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>623911</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Trudi Entwistle worked with water@leeds to explore how water influences the character of the landscape in and around the uplands of the South Pennines. &amp;quot;Upstream&amp;quot; charts Trudi's changing perspective of this landscape based on dialogue with the scientists who study the upland environment.

Key findings are:
? Prescribed burning on peatlands was shown to have clear effects on
peat hydrology, peat chemistry and physical properties, river water
chemistry and river ecology.
? Burning reduces the organic matter content of the upper peat layers.
The net result is that the peat is less able to retain important particles
known as exchangeable cations. In other words, the peat in burned sites
is deprived of chemicals which are important for plant growth and for
buffering acidic rainfall.
? Lower concentrations of nutrient elements found in peat soils in burned
river basins do not support the idea that burning enriches the peat with
nutrients from ash.
? Rivers draining burned catchments were characterised by lower calcium
concentrations and lower pH relative to rivers draining unburned
catchments. Rivers draining burned sites had higher concentrations of
silica, manganese, iron and aluminium compared to unburned
catchments.
? There was no difference between burned and unburned catchments in
peat nitrogen concentrations or in carbon to nitrogen ratios (high C/N is
considered unfavourable to microbial decomposition of peat), and no
significant changes in peat pH.
? Water-table depth is very important in peatlands for maintaining their
stability and function as a carbon store. Water tables were found to be
significantly deeper for burned catchments than for unburned ones.
Deeper water tables would suggest a greater scope for degradation of
the peat and loss of carbon to the atmosphere.
? Sphagnum is an important peat-forming species. Changes in the
hydrological properties of the peat after fire make the peat less
conducive to Sphagnum moss growth.
? River flow in catchments where burning has taken place appears to be
slightly more prone to higher flow peaks during heavy rain. However, this
was not a conclusive finding.
THE EMBER PROJECT
This document summarises findings of a study into the effects of moorland burning on peatlands, carried out by scientists
working on the EMBER project. The EMBER project was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council with additional
support from Yorkshire Water. The comprehensive five year study assessed the impacts of prescribed vegetation burning by
comparing five burned and five unburned river basins across the English Pennines. The EMBER project compared the hydrology,
water chemistry, soil properties and aquatic ecosystems of these burned and unburned areas.
The uplands of the UK are an important source of river water, form valuable habitats, provide a large store of carbon and deliver diverse environments for recreation
and farming. There has been concern about prescribed vegetation burning in the uplands in terms of its impacts on river waterq uality and flows, river ecology,
peatland hydrology, soil physical properties and carbon storage. There are ongoing debates about the wider environmental impacts of burning, although the evidence
base to date is minimal because there has been a lack of co-ordinated research into how burning affects upland environments. The EMBER project has provided new
integrated understanding across multiple linked river basin processes (soils to streams), using comparable methods at replicated study sites and over a broad
geographical region (Pennines).
? Burning vegetation alters the natural peat hydrology in the upper layers
of the peat affecting the balance of where water flow occurs. Recovery
of many hydrological properties appears to be possible if a site is left
unburned over many years.
? Prescribed peatland vegetation burning leads to significant increases in
mean and maximum near-surface soil temperatures in the years
following burning as well as lower minima (and thus wider thermal
variability).
? Thermal regimes appear to recover as vegetation regrows. This recovery
was also seen in soil hydrology data from burned plots of different ages.
? Macroinvertebrates play a vital role in aquatic food webs by feeding on
algae, microbes and detritus at the base of food chains before they
themselves are consumed by birds, fish and amphibians. The research
found that river macroinvertebrate population diversity was reduced in
burned sites.
? Particulate organic matter (predominantly peat) deposits were
increased up to four-fold in the bed sediments of burned rivers
compared to unburned rivers.
? In burned sites, river macroinvertebrate populations were dominated by
groups that are commonly found in higher abundance in disturbed river
systems, such as non-biting midge larvae (Chironomidae) and
burrowing stonefly larvae (Nemouridae).
? Increases in the abundance of disturbance-tolerant taxa counteract
declines and/or losses amongst some groups (i.e. mayflies) which are
typically sensitive to reduced pH, increased aluminium and deposition
of fine sediments. These changes show that burning increases the effect
of biological stressors compared to unburned rivers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- Education for upland managers
