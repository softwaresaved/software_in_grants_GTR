&lt;p>The research will involve a literature review that includes a series of evidence-based policy solutions to the key policy challenges.

&lt;p>The research will also entail the fellow supporting NIO members in terms of developing their own research capacity and skills. Throughout the six-months the fellow will conduct a series of informal interviews with key stakeholders that are involved in the formulation and implementation of strategies, policies and processes associated with a shared future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The fellow will also produce a series of thematic policy briefs, which will contextualise the issues and outline the key challenges in terms of formulating and implementing suitable policy responses.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>To consider the challenges to building a shared society in Northern Ireland this research project entails a comprehensive literature review and the provision of on-going support and advice to the NIO and UK Ministers. In terms of beneficiaries the applicant envisages the research impacting on a number of individuals and institutions including: 
a) Members of the NIO involved in the development of strategies, policies and approaches around the challenges to building a shared society;
b) UK Ministers with a vested interest and responsibility for social, economic and political issues in Northern Ireland;
c) Public sector bodies;
d) Civil society i.e. clergy, community and voluntary organisations;
e) Peace building and conflict transformation practitioners;
f) Politicians i.e Ministers, MLAs and councillors;
g) Academics across institutions and disciplines engaged in research and study on the challenges to building a shared society. 

Each of these stakeholders will benefit from the project in different ways. Members of the NIO through working with the Fellow will develop and increase their research skills, techniques and capacity as the Fellow will introduce them to different qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. UK Ministers and the NIO will also benefit in terms of an increase in their knowledge and understanding of the challenges to building a shared society through the comprehensive literature review and policy briefs. They will also have current assessments and the most relevant evidence to incorporate into their own positions on various policy options that pertain to building a shared society.

As for local public sector bodies, civil society, politicians and practitioners, they will benefit by having an opportunity to contribute to the literature review and act as 'critical friends' through semi-structured interviews and roundtable discussions. They will be encouraged to contribute to the on-going policy debate and provide examples of successes and challenges of programmes that have attempted to build a shared society at different levels (local and macro). This will provide a strong and robust knowledge base, which will contribute to evidence-based policy development within the NIO and the UK government. 

In terms of the benefits for academia, the research project will strengthen the links between the policy-making process and those engaged in academic research. The Fellow will create an environment which is conducive to collaboration and the sharing of information which will mean that academic research has a pathway to informing policy-makers through critical engagement, and those involved in policy development have access to the most recent and relevant research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39690</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Since the Award concluded a number of internal research briefing papers have been used to support the thinking and discussions within the department around the issues of legacy, parades and identity in Northern Ireland.
