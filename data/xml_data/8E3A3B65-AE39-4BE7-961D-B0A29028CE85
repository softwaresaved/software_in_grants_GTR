Despite its importance, very little is known about the extent of tax evasion and how it depends on enforcement policies such as audit strategies, penalties, and information collection processes. There are several reasons for this ignorance; one of them being that tax evasion by its nature is not observed in the data. Moreover, attempts to estimate the effect of enforcement policies on evasion run into the problem that the observed variation in enforcement is not exogenous but rather an endogenous response to compliance itself. These problems undermine attempts to learn about tax evasion based on non-experimental methods and motivate the use of an experimental approach. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project analyses a unique field experiment carried out in collaboration with Danish IRS. The experiment imposes different audit regimes on randomly selected tax payers in order to estimate the deterrence effect of tax audits on evasion as well as the total extent of evasion. Based on the experimental findings, it will be possible to investigate a number of normative issues pertaining to the optimal design of enforcement policies.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>61977</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Two of the most important advances in the public economics literature are the focus on quasi-experimental variation and the use of large administrative tax datasets. This research project has been the first to extend these advances to a developing country and thereby has started a new research agenda at the intersection of public and development economics. Our research has exploited the unique access to the administrative tax records in Pakistan and estimated behavioural responses by taxpayers (both individuals and firms) to the quasi-experimental variation provided by the Pakistani income tax schedule.

In our analysis of the personal income tax schedule (Kleven and Waseem, QJE 2013) we have found sharp taxable income responses to tax rates, with responses being much larger for self-employed individuals (whose income is self-reported) than for wage earners (whose income is third-party reported and thus harder to misreport). We also find that a large amount of tax payers are unable to respond optimally as their pre-tax earnings are located in a strictly dominated region just above the notches where the average income tax rate jumps. Overall, this work is the first to show that informational frictions and tax literacy may be very important in settings with low human capital. Our analysis of the corporate income tax schedule (Best et al., 2014, forthcoming at JPE) shows that incorporated forms respond sharply to the change between a profit tax base and a turnover tax base implied by the minimum tax regime in Pakistan -- a production inefficient tax policy that is ubiquitous in developing countries. Our analysis indicates that this response is due to changes in tax evasion with non-compliance being much more important under profit taxation (up to 74 percent of the reported tax liability). This study is the very first to provide micro evidence on the compliance effects of switching between production-efficient and production-inefficient tax instruments in settings with limited fiscal capacity. Given the fundamental role of government revenues in supporting growth, this research on the choice of tax instruments highlights the need, where fiscal capacity is limited, to move beyond the traditional, narrow focus on production efficiency in underpinning growth to a broader understanding of the trade-offs between production efficiency and revenue-raising efficiency.

Our research has also introduced new empirical methods based on bunching techniques (see Chetty et al. 2009, Saez 2010). In Kleven et al. (2013), we have developed a method to translate bunching around a tax notch into taxable income responses and to identify optimization frictions. In Best et al. (2014), we have developed a method to translate bunching at the non-standard kink implied by the minimum tax regime into real and evasions responses. These methods have already been taken up in new research papers (see e.g., xx, xx, xx) and are expected to be heavily used in the future.

While the implementation of modern broad-based taxes has played a central role in the debate on economic development and growth based on the experience in developed countries, our work has identified very clearly how the context is very different in developing countries and shown that different circumstances call for different policies. As such our research has laid out a new agenda at the intersection of development and public economics to analyse tax policy and behavioural responses using administrative data in developing countries and identifying the relevant constraints for tax policy in this context.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research project has been based on a tight integration of theoretical and empirical analysis, a key ingredient of frontier research in economics. We expect the research questions, the resources we have opened up and the methods we have introduced to be taken up in new research projects to further expand our knowledge, both in Pakistan (see for example Best 2014, Waseem 2014) and other developing countries.
The ultimate objective of this research project has been to increase the effectiveness of tax policies in developing countries. We have provided a framework and empirical evidence to evaluate the revenue and efficiency effects of taxation. The result of this project will provide a basis for better decision making in the public policy arena and are expected to have a significant impact on current policy making, not only in Pakistan, but also in other developing countries.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5C2F2E0D-1CA9-4FBC-B617-2827C132BE9E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461dd24a317e7.16034792</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G027072/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3241</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
