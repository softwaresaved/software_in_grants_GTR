These companies, supply chains and intermediaries constitute the UK designer fashion industry and consist of a poorly understood complex web of interactions. The British Fashion Council has identified a number of issues that is preventing the industry from reaching its full growth potential. These challenges include lack of a formal R&amp;amp;D culture across the industry, lack of knowledge and contacts within the designer fashion industry and weak knowledge exchange and open innovation practices. 

The FIREup project will address these issues. Specifically, FIREup will focus on the creation of a prototype digital platform that will research new models of knowledge exchange (KE) for the industry and foster open innovation. The platform will create: an accessible knowledge base for academic/B-2-B interactions, integrate research methodologies into the industry creating new collaborations between science and design disciplines, and support the industry to reduce its carbon footprint by sharing best practice. 

The platform will be a research tool that delivers quantitative data identifying knowledge and asset flows. It will also be used to catalyse research collaborations linked to funding calls. New participants will register information about themselves that will provide valuable insight into research needs, cluster formations, existing networks &amp;amp; collaborations and KE models.

Sandpits will shape open research calls to test &amp;amp; validate the platform. Project partners &amp;amp; SMEs will deliver research supported by a voucher (funded from FIREup). Outcomes of research projects will be presented as case studies, showcasing the platform and also used for dissemination activities. The platform will be online, making the data readily accessible to registered participants. It will be easily updateable to take account of rapid changes within the industry.

FIREup will draw upon established networks and existing alumni from fashion focused UK HEIs to ensure initial rapid project development. The University of the Arts London (UAL) will lead the FIREup Project leveraging the social capital vested within alumni networks to engage with small businesses within this sector, particularly those that do not access or take advantage of new research developments.

Research will be practice-led and respond to the need for KE between industry and the academia, including:

- Relationship-building opportunities at different levels within the industry, helping SMEs to access the wider designer fashion ecosystem in order to promote their products, access new contacts and tap into academic/entrepreneurial expertise.

- Exploring research and design processes in academia and industry and how new collaborations between science &amp;amp; textile disciplines can be developed.

- Building communication &amp;amp; collaboration platforms, to enhance KE opportunities, develop R&amp;amp;D consortia and provide new research insight.

A multi-disciplinary research team from across UAL and project partners will leverage their significant expertise and social capital to ensure FIREup is a success. The Centre for Fashion Enterprise (CFE) and Designer-Manufacturer Innovation Support Centre (DISC) will contribute insights into the UK designer fashion economy. Design Against Crime Research Centre (DACRC) will contribute knowledge/experience of award winning practice-led open innovation approaches to design research. The Centre for Sustainable Fashion (CSF) and Textile Futures Research Centre (TFRC) will contribute knowledge focused on innovation and sustainability. Fashion Design Studio (FDS) will support designer fashion enterprises to adopt new digital technologies.

It is anticipated that the open KE platform has potential for significant beneficial legacy to the designer fashion industry beyond the project duration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Data from the digital platform will provide detailed insight into how the designer fashion industry currently operates. This knowledge will help to develop new thinking that will lead to more efficient models of KE that can be implemented, in order to deliver increased collaborative outcomes between academia and industry. Findings from the platform will be shared by online communications within the platform and also by the use of case studies at FIREup workshops and networking events. Capacity will be developed and built by creating new, and sharing existing knowledge, expertise, methods and tools. 

Public Sector

- Academia gains valuable insight into how the designer fashion industry functions, obtaining new research insights into industry needs to inform further targeted research bids.

- FIREup results will shape future educational fashion course content. The platform will identify emerging trends and changing needs of the industry and these can be reflected in degree courses, 
 as they are refreshed. 

- Policy makers recognise the importance economically &amp;amp; culturally of a strong UK Fashion Sector. Results from the FIREup project will help shape &amp;amp; influence policy development that supports the
 growth and competitiveness of the overall sector. 

Private Sector

- Designer fashion enterprises become more knowledgeable of the design fashion ecosystem and are better able to make more informed decisions. The creation of the KE map of the designer fashion
 ecosystem helps to reduce market failures due to lack of information that designer fashion enterprises encounter that currently prevents them from making informed decisions.

- CMT units are able to build their networks and use the FIRE platform to identify and engage in new collaborations that lead to new innovations. This will enable a culture of R&amp;amp;D in CMT manufacturing
 units and other designer fashion enterprises.

- The FIREup project will implement open research innovations and KE practices within the UK designer fashion industry leading to a cultural change that delivers a 'new breed' of designer fashion SMEs
 focused on industrial and cultural innovation.

Wider Public

- The FIREup project has environmental and sustainability goals at the heart of the project. The platform will bring together the designer fashion industry (industry &amp;amp; academia) to share best practice 
 on tackling environmental and sustainability challenges.

- Reducing the UK designer fashion carbon footprint is a priority. Tackling challenges of offshore garment manufacturing vs. local production, mass customisation, and adopting new materials, will
 reduce energy consumption and waste materials, making the industry play its role in reducing carbon footprint and adopting more environmentally sustainable practices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200813</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This 6 minute film documents the initial results of a new collaboration between accessories designer/maker Michelle Lowe-Holder and virtual 3D designer Dr Thomas Makryniotis to realise new prototype bags utilising 3D printing technology - a brand new research and development area for the designer.

One example of impact on a micro business, the accessories designer Michelle Lowe-Holder has independently continued her use of 3D printing in experimental designs, having been introduced to the technology (and learning about designing for the constraints of its production) for the first time via a FIREup catalyst project in 2013. 
Another of the SMEs, Christopher Raeburn, funded by a FIREup Catalyst project in 2013/14 has utilised the research and knowledge exchange undertaken during that project identifying unique brand values and sustainability ethos of the business to launch a new hybrid 'Remade' studio space in East London combining design, retail and production processes and narratives. This allows customers to have interaction with the entire sustainable design, development and making process, demonstrating impact of the original research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BD1E18E3-0489-45CD-BE0C-4BBE6BFE8AB7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Four action research projects led to deep insights into the collaborative process between micro and small designer fashion companies and academics, and the significance of brokering and mentoring roles by academics in knowledge exchange. The difference in time frames within the industry and academia creates one of the signiifcant barriers to collaborative research.
The importance of trusted networks in the designer fashion sector became evident, and insights into the geographical extent of networks of collaborators, clients and suppliers were gained via a pilot study of 12 textile designers. 
Through Catalyst Projects and specific targeted discussion workshops, FIREup developed enhanced capability within a section of the designer fashion community in London, enabling them to think about research and development as a longer term strategy underpinning more than the design of the next collection.
The project tested a variety of means of engagement with the time-poor and resource-poor designer fashion sector: online platform using a Twitter feed of information; online discussion group; small group face-to-face workshops; funding competition to catalyse research ideas, collaborations and knowledge exchange; practice-led action research projects; online survey; interviews. The time invested in face-to-face workshops created a trusted and loyal community and enabled online engagement to follow. The combination of online and offline engagement appears effective in knowledge exchange for the designer fashion sector.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The PI and members of the FIREup team have continued to collaborate on three further funded projects dealing with specific aspects of the original broad research agenda: 1) AHRC FIRE.Digital project has redeveloped the original prototype Fireup web platform to become fire-fashion.uk; 2) CreativeWorks London Networks project developed an interactive online survey to capture the knowledge landscape of designer fashion and textile collaborations and eco system. 3) A workshop for fashion professionals and academics, resources survey and report have been developed on the subject of 'What's Digital about Fashion Design?' funded by RCUK NEMODE Network+ initiative. These materials are publicly availabe via the www.fire-fashion.uk web platform for the benefit of academia and the fashion industry to access information about digital approaches to the fashion design and development cycle. 
Five films representing accessible case studies of academic and fashion and textile designer collaboration and knowledge exchange are available on Vimeo (https://vimeo.com/fireupual/videos) and via the FIRE-Fashion web platform www.fire-fashion.uk.
Academic outputs in the form of journal papers are in development on the collaborative process of knowledge exchange specifically in the designer fashion sector, the implementation of a research and development culture within the sector, and development of innovative business models and production process in the context of sustainability. An academic paper was presented at the biennial Global Fashion Conference in October 2016, Stockholm 'Reconciling Innovation with Environmental and Economic Sustainability' featuring two catalyst project case studies and background research from the FIREup data gathering- survey and interviews.
The PI is developing a further funding bid to AHRC to develop this work in a sector-specific research context.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0A8AE1CD-55ED-41E8-8962-E54622DD5057</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/99883995</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Online platform for the designer fashion community and academia to sign up and connect to enhance research and innovation potential</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F992DB4-74BE-4758-B34C-307B97520C9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public and industry awareness of potential for creative innovation and knowledge exchange in the designer fashion sector, through case study projects</gtr:impact><gtr:title>FIREup (Fashion Innovation Research and Enterprise ) online platform</gtr:title><gtr:type>e-Business Platform</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.fireup.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K002724/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FA25733D-A456-4A1B-9D5C-7119577368D9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufacturing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6A482B09-D749-4443-8AF0-654984FCE91D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufact.
