unpredictable water availability</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/J011851/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Enabling food production to keep pace with population growth in the face of global climate change is a significant challenge. Both high and low extremes in rainfall increasingly limit food production, particularly for the poorest farmers. Furthermore, droughts and floods are predicted to occur more frequently under climate change, whilst the availability of water for agriculture will decline. The &amp;quot;green revolution&amp;quot; resulted in a doubling of rice yields across much of Asia, but demand for rice now exceeds production and UN FAO predictions suggest rice yields will need to increase by 50% by 2050 to meet population growth. A quarter of global rice production, rising to 45% in India, is in rain-fed environments thus at serious risk from climate change. 
 
New developments in modern plant breeding are allowing scientists to address this problem. The use of DNA based molecular markers that predict how adult plants perform under challenging environments such as drought allow breeding to be speeded up and different phenotypes or traits to be combined and transferred from one variety to another. These molecular tools make the selection process much more efficient so that what previously would have taken six generations can now be done in two. However, the loss of genetic diversity during the hundreds of years of domestication of crops such as rice means that the germplasm associated with modern cultivars offers limited scope for the improvements that are needed to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. 
 
The exciting thing about this project is that we will use new technology platforms developed in one of our laboratories at Cornell University, USA, to access valuable genetic variation from ancestral wild species of rice, introduce this to modern day elite cultivars that are widely grown in India and identify new varieties that have increased yields under drought conditions due to the presence of small segments of DNA from the wild species. Field trialling of hundreds of different lines carrying different segments of DNA from the wild species will be conducted by the Central Rice Research Institute in India and in parallel researchers at the Universities of York and Cornell will carry out a range of different experiments to understand what causes increased drought resistance in specific lines. With this new understanding it will be possible to develop new DNA based molecular markers that allow the genetic variation from the wild species to be efficiently transferred to a wide range of commercial rice cultivars. So the outputs during the four year project will not only be improved rice varieties but also new breeding tools for rapid deployment of drought conferring genetic variation to multiple rice cultivars. 
 
However, the adoption of new rice varieties by local communities is dependent on multiple factors in addition to yield performance with grain quality being one of the most important. Cultural and sociological issues such as the role of gender also play a significant part in determining the success of a new cultivar and in order to address this we will perform a socioeconomic study to assess the likely uptake patterns of any new varieties and their impact on farmers' incomes. The impact of new rice cultivars on yield, per unit cost of production, and total production per specific input (land, labour, fertilizers, seeds) will be evaluated and on-farm testing and participatory evaluation will be an integral component of cultivar field trials. 
 
This project will also model the impact of new varieties to quantify how yields are enhanced in drought-prone landscapes currently and in the future as climate changes. This information along with the outputs from our socio-economic studies will inform policy makers in developing countries about the socio-economic benefits of new varieties and thus improve adoption of the most effective strategies to address food insecurity and poverty.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The loss of genetic diversity during domestication means that the germplasm associated with modern rice cultivars offers limited scope for improvements that are needed to meet the challenges of a growing population and changing environment. To address this issue the McCouch lab have pioneered the use of wild genetic resources of rice to enhance performance of elite cultivars. In this project we will perform comprehensive field trials for drought resistance in rain-fed areas of India using two sets of 96 Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines (CSSLs) both in the elite, O. sativa, indica cv. IR64 background, but containing introgressions from two, genetically diverse accessions of the wild ancestor, O. rufipogon. In parallel we will perform elemental, metabolomic, transcriptomic, physiological and water use efficiency analysis of the same material in York and Cornell. Combining the outputs of the field and laboratory analysis will lead to the selection of elite lines for immediate use and drought conferring CSSLs that can be rapidly introgressed into multiple commercial cultivars. Multiple sociological and agronomic factors dictate uptake of new rice cultivars by local communities and to address this issue the work on development of new cultivars will be fully integrated with a socio-economic study to assess from a farmer perspective what influences their likely uptake pattern, their impact on yield and related cost of production. To further facilitate impact promising material selected from field trials and experimental analysis will undergo on-farm testing and participatory evaluation by year 4 of the project. Modelling the impact of new varieties to quantify how yields are enhanced in drought-prone landscapes currently and in the future as climate changes will feed into the socio-economic study and the outputs will be used to inform policy-makers about the benefits to be gained through investment in developing new, locally adapted drought tolerant rice cultivars.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research and how?

We anticipate a number of beneficiaries. 

First and foremost people in poverty in rain-fed areas of India who are dependent on rice for survival are expected to benefit directly through the use of improved drought tolerant cultivars of rice that will be produced either during the lifetime of the project or as a direct result of deployment of genetic resources and tools such as drought tolerance conferring CSSLs that are outputs of the project. The integration of socio-economic and modelling components designed to align both current and future rice farmer needs with plant breeding targets and outputs is a particular feature of this research programme that should maximise translation of the research outputs and impact. The availability of new varieties that deliver reliable high yields under drought and flooding conditions will help alleviate hunger and provide sufficient security for farmers to diversify their activities and seek other forms of income to lift themselves out of poverty. The timeframe for expected benefits in this respect are in the years immediately following the end of the 4 year project since the relevant outputs will take at least 4 years to develop.

The investment of approximately 10% of the total budget of this project in capacity building in India, particularly in the education and training of personnel in topics relevant to the work programme will provide long term benefit to the public infrastructure underpinning agricultural development and extension. A concerted effort to train staff to adopt a multidisciplinary approach that encompasses modern molecular breeding of new rice cultivars with socioeconomic studies that address the barriers that often delay or prevent their uptake should result in a culture change in approach that has a long term impact. Workshops in India and the UK in Years 2 and 3 of the project will focus particularly on this aspect.

In terms of capacity building the project will also introduce the use of high throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays developed specifically for rice to CRRI staff and will enable them to do marker assisted selection as part of this research initiative. This will represent a step-change in through-put of marker assisted selection which can then be applied to other traits and crops in India. This exemplar should therefore lead to further investment in this cutting edge technology in India.

Public Sector Policy Makers will also benefit from this work because it will provide them with information on the impact of developing new rice cultivars that is based on robust socio-economic and modelling studies that take into account current end-user preferences and needs and future climate change predictions. This should represent a powerful information pack that can help inform government policy not only in India and the UK but in other countries as well. Although the current programme of work is focussed on India, the outputs could have wider impact since elite cultivars such as IR64 are used widely throughout Asia. Furthermore, the approach we are adopting could serve as a template and exemplar for other R&amp;amp;D programmes that combine cutting edge science with strategic targets in a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both product development and factors affecting delivery from the outset. 

Academia will also benefit from this work. The PIs involved have impressive track records in terms of peer review publications and cutting edge interdisciplinary research. The combination of robust datasets from comprehensive experimental and field trial analysis of CSSL populations will produce multiple publication quality datasets. The molecular basis of drought tolerance in higher plants is a hot topic of research and we anticipate this work will contribute to that field in particular through top quality peer reviewed publications and presentations at international meetings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1764541</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Colombia, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F24607C-C59F-4D13-8207-68908F03ED4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The McCouch lab is continuing genomics characterisation and tools development for these lines.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr. Lorieux sent seed to Cornell from two populations of CSSLs (Curinga x O. rufipogon and Curinga x O. meridionalis) developed jointly by CIAT and Cornell.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Seeds provided by Dr Lorieux of CIAT were amplified at Cornell by PhD student, Juan David Arbelaez, and aliquots were forwarded to the University of York and to the Central Rice Research Institute (under the standard MTA).

In 2014 a women's focus group meeting was held in Mahendrapur village in Dhenkan district of Orissa, India, attended by members of our research team and 10 women.
In June 2015 eight Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted in Dhenkanal (4 villages) and Koderma (4 villages) districts in Odisha and Jharkhand respectively. A further 11 FGDs were conducted in July 2015 across 4 villages in Koderma. This participatory rural appraisal tool was used to collect qualitative information on the perceptions of changing weather patterns and factors affecting farmers' decisions to adopt new varieties, as well as to analyse farmer's perceptions of constraints to rice cultivation, thus assessing their ability to improve food security and reduce poverty.
 These focus group meetings facilitated discussions and enabled members of our research team from the University of York and the Central Rice Research Institute to obtain key information from the farmers on potential outcomes of technological development.

At the start of the project a general meeting with farmers and focus group meetings took place at the project site in India. During the discussions it became evident that male dominated societal rules and norms, and a complex household environment of joint decisions, multiple objectives and mutual dependence can make it difficult to target or predict the gender-related outcomes of technological development.

Objectives 0 to 3 inclusive have been completed, and the remainder are well advanced. Details below:

Objective 0: Establish optimal experimental and field conditions (Yr 1-2) - OBJECTIVE COMPLETE. Experimental (glasshouse, York) and field (rainout shelter, irrigated field station and rain-fed upland, India) conditions have been established for a combination of drought resistant and drought susceptible lines from CRRI, IRRI and Africa Rice. 

Objective 1: Amplify seeds and genotype two populations of CSSLs at Cornell, ship aliquots of seeds to CRRI and York; amplify CSSLs under favourable conditions and take baseline observations at both CRRI and York (Yr 1) - OBJECTIVE COMPLETE.
Seed amplification of originally proposed set of CSSLs in IR64 background was delayed. Project partners informed funder and agreed to progress with an altered set of CSSLs comprising 48 Curinga X O. rufipogon lines and 32 Curinga X O. meridionalis lines. 

Objective 2: Screen the two libraries of CSSLs under both favourable and drought conditions and identify lines with minimal relative yield reduction (RYR) under drought in field trials at CRRI (Yrs 2-3) - OBJECTIVE COMPLETE.

Objective 3: Select 10-20 most promising CSSLs and evaluate them for yield, drought tolerance, grain quality and stability in advanced field trials at CRRI and for other traits at York (Yr 4) - OBJECTIVE COMPLETE.

Objectives 4, 5, 6 and 7 - these objectives are well advanced as detailed below. A no cost extension to 30 June 2017 was awarded to allow completion and maximise the impact of the programme. 

Objective 4: Introgress drought tolerance and yield traits from selected CSSLs into elite Indian rice genotypes at CRRI (Yr 3-4). The Illumina Infinium 6K SNP has been successfully deployed in India to advance this objective. CSSLs conferring drought tolerance are being introgressed into CRRI (now NRRI) chosen breeding material.

Objective 5: Undertake laboratory-based analysis on CSSLs to characterize the molecular, biochemical and physiological traits that underpin improved performance under drought at York (elemental, metabolomics and transcriptomic analysis) and Cornell (root architecture) (Yr 1-4). Detailed physiological, biochemical and gene expression analyses have been performed on aerial and root tissue. Most significant changes were found in osmolytes. Manuscript in preparation. 

Objective 6: Identify and address the socio-economic barriers to adoption of new drought resistant rice varieties at York and CRRI (Yr 1-4). Extensive farmer surveys and focussed discussion groups (FDGs) in rain-fed rice areas have formed the basis for data collection. All data currently being processed.

Objective 7: Model the impact of new varieties in drought-prone areas in the longer term at York and CRRI (Yr 1-4). A main conclusion from this work is that almost 15% -40% of the existing rainfed rice area in India may become climatically unsuitable for rice cultivation by 2050. Rice growth modelling and the impact of improved varieties are integrated with the breeding and socio-economic components of the programme.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By the end of the project the international team aim to produce improved varieties of rice that maintain their yield in environmentally challenging conditions such as drought or floods, and eventually to have these new varieties accepted and adopted by local communities in rain-fed areas of India. The team also aimed to produce new breeding tools to enable rapid further development of new rice varieties by Indian researchers - this has been achieved, as detailed under the 'Research Tools and Methods' and 'Use of Facilities and Resources, sections of this report. 
Our vision is that the benefits of this research reach those people who need them, not only leading to improved food security for poorer subsistence farmers in India, but also helping to lift them out of poverty.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FEDC7FFD-A02F-4003-AC30-358D2A87E86A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Dr Namrata Singh of Cornell University prepared a step-by-step video tutorial on genotyping analysis using a SNP-calling pipeline, now available on YouTube.</gtr:description><gtr:id>439796F2-9897-426C-980D-32F9D9644C32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The object of the video tutorial was to train people working on the project to process raw Infinium array data, call SNPs and interpret the genotyping results.
