Each of these proteins is specified in the genome, the DNA of the organism. The process of generating a particular type of protein involves copying the relevant section of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then decoded to give rise to the protein. Thus an mRNA can be regarded as equivalent to a video tape, which can be decoded by an appropriate device (video recorder) to give pictorial information, and the DNA can be regarded as an archive of all possible videos, joined together end-to-end. However, in mammals and other higher organisms, the relevant section of the DNA is initially copied into a pre-mRNA which needs to be processed to give the mature mRNA suitable for decoding. In the video analogy, this processing involves splicing out irrelevant parts of the pre-mRNA tape, and splicing the remaining parts together to give a video tape suitable for decoding. Remarkably, most of the pre-mRNA video tapes in mammalian organisms can be spliced in more than one way, resulting in a number of slightly different versions of the final video. This project concerns a protein known as polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) which plays a major role in determining which pattern of alternative splicing will occur. In addition, it also plays an important role in the decoding of certain mRNAs. PTB is a protein which binds to (interacts with) RNA, showing preference for specific RNA sequences. PTB actually has four distinct RNA binding surfaces, so that a single PTB molecule can interact simultaneously with 4 different segments of the RNA. It is thought that this multi-site binding is the key to how PTB can regulate the pattern of splicing, and promote decoding of certain mRNAs. We have developed methods to determine the orientation of PTB binding to any RNA (i.e. which of the four RNA binding surfaces binds to which site on the RNA), and to find out which of these four PTB-RNA interactions is critical for the biological action of PTB. We will use these methods to examine (i) how PTB regulates the decoding of three different mRNAs that are known to require PTB binding in order that decoding can be initiated, and (ii) how PTB regulates the pattern of alternative splicing of three different pre-mRNAs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Under a current BBSRC Project Grant (BB/E004857/1), we have prepared a library of PTB mutants for use in tethered hydroxyl radical footprinting assays to map the orientation of PTB binding to its RNA targets (i.e. which RBD binds to which site on the RNA), and we have validated the approach and the particular mutants by mapping PTB interactions with two picornavirus IRESs. We are also part way through constructing PTB mutants in which the RNA binding potential of each RBD has been inactivated, to enable us to determine which RBD/target RNA interactions are critical for the biological activity of PTB. In this proposed project, these reagents will be used to examine how PTB activates certain cellular mRNA IRESs, and how it regulates splicing of certain pre-mRNAs that are subject to alternative splicing. For each type of RNA target, the orientation of PTB binding will be determined using our library of mutants in tethered hydroxyl radical footprinting assays, and the requirement for each RBD/target RNA interaction for the in vitro biological activity of the PTB will be assessed using the four mutants in which an individual RBD has been inactivated. The cellular mRNA IRESs to be studied will be c-myb, BAG-1(S) and Apaf-1. These have been chosen on the grounds that the internal ribosome 'landing site' has already been mapped, the PTB binding sites are known, and IRES activity is stimulated by PTB in an in vitro system. The pre-mRNA substrates subject to PTB-regulated alternative splicing will be the tropomyosin1 exon 3, FAS exon 6, and, if time allows, the N1 exon of c-src. These have likewise been chosen on the grounds that the regulation of splicing by PTB can be recapitulated in an in vitro system, and potential PTB binding sites are already known. The outcome of this work will be a greater understanding of how PTB activates the selected cellular IRESs, and regulates the splicing of the optional exon in the chosen pre-mRNA targets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>324798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mapping RNA-protein interactions: from IRESs to pre-mRNAs</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76FFAC8D-3678-450A-BFBD-EBCE99FF6D9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presentation at meeting.

Before this RNA can be used to direct the synthesis of a particular protein, various things have to happen to the RNA. Non-coding &amp;quot;intervening sequences&amp;quot; have to be removed and the correct protein-coding sequences joined together by a &amp;quot;splicing&amp;quot; process. The RNA has to be transported to the correct cellular location where it is used as a set of instructions to manufacture a particular type of protein. Most human genes undergo &amp;quot;alternative splicing&amp;quot;, in which different combinations of intervening sequences can be removed. This allows individual genes to encode more than one functionally distinct protein. This is an important process - some human diseases occur when alternative splicing is not properly controlled. The choice between different alternative splicing patterns is controlled by numerous RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that recognise particular sequences in the RNA, usually in the non-coding regions. We have been investigating how one of these proteins - polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) - recognises RNA. PTB has four separate protein domains, each of which can recognise a short RNA sequence such as UCU. Because the RNA binding domains (RBDs) of PTB are connected by flexible linkers it has been very difficult to determine the arrangement of the individual RBDs when they bind to RNA. We have used an approach that allows us to analyze, one at a time, where each of the RBDs of PTB contacts an RNA. We engineer forms of PTB in which a chemical probe is attached to just one of the RBDs. When we switch on the chemical probe, nearby RNA is cut; so by looking at the locations where the RNA is cut when the probe is placed on different RBDs, we can work out the arrangement of the four RBDs on the RNA. We also engineered other forms of the protein in which individual RBDs were altered to prevent them from binding RNA. We also combined these RNA binding mutations with the chemical probes, so that we could observe whether the ability of one RBD to contact RNA affected the ability of other RBDs to do the same. We used this set of proteins to investigate how PTB controls alternative splicing in the human FAS gene. This was an interesting example, because this alternative splicing event influences whether cells live or die. Previous investigations suggested that only a single molecule of PTB contacted the FAS exon. Our results showed that three PTB molecules bound. We also found that the four RBDs are not equal; the third and fourth RBDs are the most important. RBD3 strongly contacts a protein-coding sequence in FAS RNA, while RBD4 contacts the RNA in a number of locations in the intervening sequences, all of them containing a UC or a CC sequence. If we altered the RNA sequence where RBD3 binds, then PTB could no longer control splicing. However, if we altered the sequences where RBD4 usually binds, the PTB could still control splicing. Our results provide a detailed picture of how a protein with multiple RBDs can recognise RNA and control splicing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>i) The &amp;quot;toolkit&amp;quot; of PTB proteins that we have created can also be used by scientists investigating other functions of PTB e.g. in translation, mRNA stability or pre-mRNA 3' end processing.
ii) The single Cys-proteins could be used for other purposes. For example, modification with a bifunctional sulfhydryl and photo- reactive agent might allow for a modified CLIP approach in which the transcriptome wide contacts of individual RBDs could be monitored. This could allow important new insights into how multi-RBD proteins engage with RNA targets.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9AE04305-A0BB-4DF4-B7BD-F9B1259318E8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/18CB3AC0-9949-40B7-8E02-7FA3A9F28DA7"><gtr:id>18CB3AC0-9949-40B7-8E02-7FA3A9F28DA7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9a005c6aa609d22b786ca11c79fda470"><gtr:id>9a005c6aa609d22b786ca11c79fda470</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coelho MB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-62703-979-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:issn>1064-3745</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5C09B3E3-7CD9-4594-A15C-24099EDAE8F1"><gtr:id>5C09B3E3-7CD9-4594-A15C-24099EDAE8F1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Functional interactions between polypyrimidine tract binding protein and PRI peptide ligand containing proteins.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biochemical Society transactions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9a005c6aa609d22b786ca11c79fda470"><gtr:id>9a005c6aa609d22b786ca11c79fda470</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coelho MB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0300-5127</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3859CE2C-0E38-4D0C-8B20-CC0F854567E4"><gtr:id>3859CE2C-0E38-4D0C-8B20-CC0F854567E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Activation of picornaviral IRESs by PTB shows differential dependence on each PTB RNA-binding domain.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>RNA (New York, N.Y.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/af5a5b8f17249758a9c5a4edb720fef2"><gtr:id>af5a5b8f17249758a9c5a4edb720fef2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kafasla P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1355-8382</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B3DFC6C6-9ED1-45A3-8A96-30D9FC3992AF"><gtr:id>B3DFC6C6-9ED1-45A3-8A96-30D9FC3992AF</gtr:id><gtr:title>The organization of RNA contacts by PTB for regulation of FAS splicing.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f11cc514894310a3580c6a2c78a3e65d"><gtr:id>f11cc514894310a3580c6a2c78a3e65d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mickleburgh I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FD6ADF5C-1A4C-4E7A-AD7F-1478608CB4D1"><gtr:id>FD6ADF5C-1A4C-4E7A-AD7F-1478608CB4D1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Decoding muscle alternative splicing.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current opinion in genetics &amp; development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d0448103c15d9a8ea3e8716f47d17ff0"><gtr:id>d0448103c15d9a8ea3e8716f47d17ff0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Llorian M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0959-437X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/24675AC5-0C46-4A49-9041-242408E5C1EA"><gtr:id>24675AC5-0C46-4A49-9041-242408E5C1EA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Defining the roles and interactions of PTB.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biochemical Society transactions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/af5a5b8f17249758a9c5a4edb720fef2"><gtr:id>af5a5b8f17249758a9c5a4edb720fef2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kafasla P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0300-5127</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/H004203/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
