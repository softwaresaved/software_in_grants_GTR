Smart Materials and Design is a strategic proposal aimed at enhancing interactions between academics in Science &amp;amp; Technology, who are strongly supported by EPSRC funded research, and staff in Art &amp;amp; Design who have significant industrial involvement. Its aims are to create a suite of joint feasibility projects taking new developments in materials (super-liquid repellent surface, super-wicking surfaces, transparent and flexible light emitting materials) into product design research for applications of these new materials within areas such as technical textiles (e.g. electroactive/functional yarns/fabrics) and smart packaging. We aim to use the project to create an approach to the generation of cross-disciplinary research projects that will be self-sustaining.So far we have established a cross-University multidisciplinary Masters programme in Smart Design involving joint team projects with students drawn from Art, Design, Science and Technology. We have also prioritized our European Regional Development Fund bids to create a 2M programme, The Future Factory , whose aim is to promote sustainable design by SMEs via design in environmentally neutral technologies and materials, alternative after-life uses, re-use, recoverability, recyclability and sensitive disposal. This cross-disciplinary feasibility account proposal will strengthen the research component of these developments and further develop Smart Materials Design as a cross-University theme. The cross-disciplinary feasibility account proposal is built on the world-leading expertise within the University's School of Science &amp;amp; Technology into the materials and functional properties of extreme water-repellent surfaces and liquid penetration properties of materials (supported by an EPSRC Platform and other grants), and expertise in the application of novel thin film technologies to both print product and security devices and the investigation into novel techniques for fabricating transparent and flexible light emitting devices (supported by KTP and TSB projects). This base of expertise is linked to leading expertise in Art &amp;amp; Design in translational research for medical textiles, electro-conductive textiles, textile composites and fashion knitwear. The work in Art &amp;amp; Design is complemented by product design, industrial, graphic, furniture and packaging design expertise and expertise in the social context and sustainability of consumption arising from human/object relationships.The unifying scientific theme within this proposal is smart materials - the generation of new materials, their processing for applications and the design for acceptability and use within industry and society in a sustainable manner. For focus, the initial research theme of cross-disciplinary activity is around smart packaging, plastic and printed electronics, wearable devices and technical textiles, with an additional theme on development building on outcomes of events, debate and discussion. The three principal themes are:1. understanding the functional properties of new smart materials;2. assessing the methods by which new materials may be processed and incorporated into applications; and3. designing new materials into applications to gain added functionality and to promote sustainability.These themes have been developed with a strong relevance and collaborations across the physical sciences, engineering, technical textiles and product design. The proposal stimulates and implements cross-disciplinary collaboration via the following methods:1. Technology Design &amp;amp; Discussion Workshops2. Buzz Lunches3. Feasibility Projects4. Design &amp;amp; Awareness Events</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Smart Materials - Designing for Functionality seeks to build on the University strategy of cross-school collaboration by establishing a platform for new research directions in smart (functional and electroactive) materials, fabrics and surfaces. By implementing a package of engagement, communication and collaboration mechanisms, the project will foster a culture of multidisciplinarity through internal and externally facing partnerships, which will address research to enable the application of science to the design of new product, innovations and solutions. The project is consequently driven by the desire to realise real-world solutions based on research excellence, where industrial and social impact are inherent in the nature of the work proposed. Who will benefit from the proposed research? In addition to the academic beneficiaries, the user base for the new research collaborations to arise from this project will encompass industry (particularly SMEs), public sector (health and education), and society at large. This will be achieved initially through research to underpin the design and development of new products, such as medical devices, health and performance monitoring systems, wearable electronics and information systems - utilising combinations of materials science, device engineering, yarn, fibre and textile/packaging design. How will the benefits be realised? The potential for impact will be driven by engagement with external stakeholders through the Design and Awareness Events, Future Factory Events, and through participation by the investigators in Knowledge Transfer and UK Trade and Industry Events to publicise the research and to directly interact with the research user base. Feasibility studies will be funded to undertake the research necessary for proof of principle and technical/design demonstration to underpin development of partnerships for full project development. The communication at the heart of these partnerships will be stimulated by the events where external stakeholders will be invited to attend and participate as speakers and delegates, and to help generate the specific themes to be further developed in the feasibility studies. This will also help to generate the partnering for future project applications, which would be particularly relevant for KTP and TSB funded activities, e.g. through Collaborative Research and Development Projects. What will be done to ensure the benefits are realised? Engagement with research users is fundamental to achieving the impact aims of the project. Hence, use will be made of the existing conduits to industry as well as via external dissemination of the project methods and outcomes via presentations at KTN events, publication of research, and presentation at national and international conferences. The investigators for this project have many years of successful research collaborations and industrial engagement across the areas of materials and devices science and engineering, product and graphic design, and technical textiles, so will bring the relevant expertise and project management skills to the project to ensure success. In summary, this project will stimulate and support a new platform of cross-disciplinary research, which will be integrated with the research user base, and hence will have impact as an inherent objective.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202311</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Water: A Tale of two surfaces (Public Lecture UNN, 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>79FB87DC-16B3-4FF8-8CD1-2BE1A05A4C87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TBC</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Smart Materials Innovation Workshop (Nottingham, 2011)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F568A521-AA3F-4A4C-9845-C9D86A608A6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outcomes of various short projects were presented during a Smart Materials Innovation Workshop to an international audience during a session at the first International Smart Design Conference at Nottingham Trent University http://www.ntu.ac.uk/adbe/news_events/smart_design/index.html?campaignid=smartdesign.
