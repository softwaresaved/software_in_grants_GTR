We aim to answer three high-priority scientific and policy questions: To what extent
(a) Does labor outmigration influence (i) agricultural productivity, (ii) women's participation in farming, and (iii) exit from farming?
(b) Do remittances influence (i) farm technology use, (ii) women's participation in farming, and (iii) exit from farming?
(c) Do farm technology use and exit from farming influence subsequent outmigration?
With an estimated 214 million people l--mostly from poor agricultural regions to more industrialized countries-international migration is a key concern in scholarly and policy arenas. This unprecedented phenomenon has wide-ranging consequences both for migrant-sending and receiving locations. This study focuses on one specific, but crucial consequence - the impact of labor outmigration on agricultural productivity in migrant-sending areas. As the agriculture productivity in poor subsistence economies is closely connected with one of the world's epidemic problems: food security. FAO estimated about 870 million people were undernourished in the period 2010-12. The vast majority of these - 852 million live in developing countries. Thus, increased agricultural productivity in poor countries is a key tool for alleviating this problem. This proposed project aims to better understand the relationship between labor outmigration and agriculture, providing crucial information for scientific and policy development of food security concerns.
 Understanding the link between outmigration and agriculture is complicated by the fact that migration does not happen randomly. Additionally, changes in agricultural practices and migration are likely to influence each other. Thus, the empirical demands for adjudicating potential reciprocal relationships are high, limiting the ability of previous research to speak to these questions. To address this complication, we will leverage the Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS), a case control comparison design at the community level with a 15-year panel study of a stratified systematic sample of communities, households, and individuals in Nepal. This unusual panel study enables us to address the non-random selection of individuals into migration. Furthermore, the case control design is particularly powerful for controlling macro-level effects (e.g. climate, prices, and policies) to detect the effect of change and variation in the phenomena of interest: farm labor loss, remittances, farm technology use, agricultural productivity, and women's participation in farming. Despite the wealth of panel data, answering our specific questions requires a modest level of new data collection. Our proposed panel measurement will involve multi-mode mixed methods data collection with appropriate temporal order and timing precision necessary to assess the relationships31. 
This study will generate high quality scientific outcomes that will be widely disseminated around the world. These outcomes are (i) comprehensive panel data with potential to address perplexing methodological problems; and (ii) empirical evidence of the consequences of labor outmigration, agricultural productivity, and its interplay with gender. First the data will be made available through ICPSR and UK Data Service and publications through websites will be provided to broader audiences. Second, the findings will be disseminated among the scientific communities through presentations at national and international conferences and publication of scientific articles, research briefs, and policy briefs. Finally, our capacity building training will also enhance scientific and analytical capacity of faculty and scientists of host country institutions (AFU, NARC and others).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The empirical findings and data generated by the study proposed have high potential to impact both academia and policy at local, national, and global levels.
Impact on academia: The empirical findings will be of great use to a wide range of academic audiences (faculty, students, etc.) for teaching and research purposes. At the local level, these audiences include affiliates of AFU, NARC, and other local colleges and universities. At the national level, the findings will have strong relevance to academic audiences in migrant sending countries in South Asia. Our (UM and ISER-N) joint training program on survey methodology in Nepal has strong collaborative ties with various universities and research organizations in South Asia. Faculty, research scholars, and students from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan regularly participate in the training we offer. We will use this venue to share our findings. At the global level, the publication of findings will improve and stimulate further research in this area by scholars worldwide.
The panel measurement generated by this study with the potential for unraveling perplexing problems of selectivity, simultaneity and causal pathways, will provide researchers with the methodological means to answer high propriety scientific questions. We plan to make these measures available to a wider audience through the public release of the data. This will greatly promote data use resulting in additional publications, PhD/MSc dissertations/theses and other reports. We will further promote data use through display booths at national and international conferences, and the training we propose to offer to faculty and research scientists at AFU and NARC. We expect academic audiences will benefit from this research even beyond the current project period stimulating new research in other areas of science such as migrant health and relationship dynamics among parents, spouses and children.
 Impact on policy: Empirical answers from rigorous science provide crucial information for policy makers struggling to make the best use of scarce resources. First, understanding the extent to which loss of farm labor is associated with agricultural productivity will provide key information for policy makers to formulate migration and agriculture policy. Second, understanding the extent to which remittances from migrants compensate for the loss of male farm labor, if any, through labor-saving farm technology use is crucial for formulating agriculture mechanization policy. Finally, understanding the impact of male labor migration on women's involvement in agriculture is important for the wellbeing of women.
We plan to engage stakeholders in several stages of this program to ensure effective policy influence. The key stakeholders include: local farmers (male &amp;amp; female), women's groups, service providers and entrepreneurs (local level); District Agriculture Development Office, District Development Committee, NGOs, colleges and universities (district level); NARC, National Planning Commission, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare, INGOs, and donors engaged in rural development programs. The findings of this study will also have broader implications for the design of migration and agriculture policy worldwide. Our global target audiences are the IOM, FAO, WFP, IFRI, INGOs, donors and investors engaged in agriculture development worldwide.
Finally, to disseminate the findings we will hold a series of stakeholders meetings at each level. We will also summarize findings from peer-reviewed publications and publish them as policy briefs. At the global level, we will make these available through websites, conference presentations, and publications in scientific journals. We expect that the analysis of these data by the participants of data analysis workshops and others will generate new findings that will impact policy beyond the project period.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>531826</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute for Social and Environmental Research - Nepal (ISER-N)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Nepal, State of</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Institute for Social and Environmental Research - Nepal (ISER-N)</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA249F7C-52A5-4D3C-BC51-08D3A8DFFCA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data was collected in each of the following areas: 1) Monitoring of Population Events; 2) Seasonal Agriculture Survey; 3) Women's Participation in Farming Survey; and 4) Crop Yield Measurement.

The workshop was jointly organized by the Population Studies Center of the University of Michigan, ISER-N, and the Agriculture and Forestry University, Nepal to foster intellectual collaboration among potential consumers of the empirical evidence we will generate through rigorous scientific investigation. It focused on capacity building and receiving feedback on our three substantive research questions, the research design, and the dissemination plan. A total of 36 participants from universities, research institutions, government and non-governmental organizations attended the workshop. The participants represented areas of social science research, agricultural research and extension, policy formulation and program implementation. 

This workshop was a crucial first step in building a foundation of interdisciplinary research, education and public policy. It was attended by local, regional and national stakeholders and successfully engaged all stakeholders in cross-disciplinary discussions of instrument development, refinement, and design of data collection strategies. The workshop was highly beneficial, generating relevant and insightful feedback which has been incorporated into the program.

Notable impacts that arose from this activity include: 
1. Our program of research incorporates a broader interdisciplinary perspective as a result of the feedback provided by stakeholders at the local, regional and national level (i.e., researchers, professional practitioners, policy makers, etc.). 
2. Our program of research will impact a much broader user base as a result of facilitating multidisciplinary discussions and seeking input from stakeholders at various levels. 
3. Our program of research will continue to improve and impact more disciplines through research capacity building and dissemination of research findings as the new data become available. Additionally, we are also receiving requests from other entities in Nepal that wish to become more involved in the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://loaf.psc.isr.umich.edu/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Capacity Building Training - Survey Data Analysis Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B045003-BCEB-4486-8BFE-9E12658561F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To enhance the analytical research capacity of our collaborating organizations (AFU and NARC) and of South Asia in general, a five-day Survey Data Analysis Workshop took place from November 21-25, 2016. In total, 13 participants attended the workshop including participants from AFU and NARC (two participants from each institution). This workshop is a modified version of a standard course regularly offered by Dr. Prem Bhandari (Co-investigator of this study) and Dr. Ghimire (Principal Investigator of this study) to meet the specific analytical training needs of our collaborators. This workshop has proven very effective in enhancing analytical capacity of survey data both within Nepal and across South Asia. This year, Dr. William Axinn (Co-investigator of this study) from the University of Michigan also taught a portion of the workshop via teleconferencing technology.

It is too early to report on the impacts that arose from this activity as it is scheduled to take place on December 20-24, 2015. However, it is our expectation that by helping to enhance analytical capacity of stakeholders (the direct consumers of the empirical evidence) and broadening the data user base, we will greatly maximize the impact of this program of research at the national level.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://loaf.psc.isr.umich.edu/news</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research highlights the diversification of labor migration destinations originating from Nepal and the financial impact of inbound remittances. Poverty, unemployment, fragile livelihood strategies, and sparse economic opportunities are the main catalysts of migration-domestic and international-in Nepal. Findings from Bhandari (2016) reveal that migration destination is a strong predictor of remittance amount received and that remittance amounts are largest from destinations in South Korea, Malaysia, and Japan, followed by America, Australia, Europe and Persian Gulf countries. The Nepali labor migration sector indicates potential as an important driver of domestic economic development.

Additionally, findings from Bhandari and Ghimire (2016) reveal that net of other factors, household use of farm technology-particularly use of tractors-significantly increases out-migration; individuals living in households that used a tractor migrated 24% more than those in households that did not use a tractor. Other farm technologies are not statistically significant in the out-migration decision-making process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will help members of Nepali farm households make more informed migration and agricultural decisions to improve farm productivity and household economies in the short term, and the local economy more broadly in the long term. Deciphering which migration destinations provide the largest remittances arms household members with knowledge to more accurately plan approaches for maximizing remittance amounts. This will impact farm households more immediately, but eventually the local economy which leads to opportunities for policy makers to design meaningful, evidence-based programs to improve agricultural practices and creative economies (through remittances). Additionally, having data to inform members of farm households regarding which farm implements, tractors, improved varieties of crop seed and pesticides are worthwhile investments allows for more informed decision making and better economic outcomes. These findings are an important first step in providing policy makers with empirical evidence to begin improving agricultural practices, local economies and shaping policies not only in Nepal, but hopefully throughout many other LICs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6C46EC83-F50E-4248-8619-A0F414BB9BDF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://loaf.psc.isr.umich.edu/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>To create measures of agricultural productivity and to validate data collected from farmers' responses in the Seasonal Agriculture Survey, we measured yields of seasonal principal crops (such as paddy, wheat, maize and mustard) grown by farm households in each season. Our standard sampling procedure involves a 30-50% random sample from the households who have grown the specific crop. Based on our sampling strategy, we conducted mustard crop yield measurement from February-March 2016. Out of 222 randomly selected sample plots from 546 mustard growing households within the 151 sample CVFS neighborhoods, the mustard crop cutting measurement was completed in 196 sample plots, with a measurement completion rate of 88%. Wheat and lentil crop cutting measurement was conducted from March-April 2016. Out of 134 randomly selected sample plots from 350 wheat growing households, the wheat crop yield measurement was completed in 114 sample plots with a measurement completion rate of 85%. Out of 165 randomly selected sample plots from 552 lentil growing households, the lentil crop yield measurement was completed in 149 sample plots with a measurement completion rate 90%. Maize crop cutting measurement was conducted from June-August 2016. Out of 262 randomly selected sample plots from 853 maize growing households, the maize crop yield measurement was completed in 241 sample plots with a measurement completion rate of 92%. Maize crop cutting measurement was followed by a second wave of paddy crop yield measurement. Paddy crop yield measurement was conducted from October-November 2016. Out of 673 randomly selected sample plots from 1,351 paddy growing households, paddy crop yield measurement was completed in 486 sample plots with a measurement completion rate of 72%.
