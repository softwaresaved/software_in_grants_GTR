But while different generations of directors are being drawn to explore Italy's changing socio-economic realities; 'A New Italian Political Cinema?' will ascertain whether their depictions of Italian society are merely motivated by a desire for fresh appearance forms and stark local colour, or by a radical impulse for change. The network will also investigate phenomena that are instrumental in obstructing or facilitating the production and diffusion of radical film projects in Italy, factors ranging from state and self-censorship to distribution oligopolies. In theoretical terms, the project will revisit the writings of cultural scholars such as Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson to consider whether Italian cinema - and, by implication, UK and other national cinemas - has become a locus where the ideological and political hegemony of dominant socio-economic groups is realistically depicted and challenged. Conversely, is this new wave of cinematic work merely producing imaginary resolutions to the social antagonisms that it portrays, for example by repressing problematic social content via mythical narrative reconciliations? In recent Italian films, which signs or ideologemes - Jameson's term - have become the focal point of antagonism between conflicting class interests? For example, in the films of Gabriele Salvatores, mass culture and virtual reality technology have both functioned as loci for conflict between progressive, emancipatory impulses and dominant, hegemonic forces. \n\nThe network will initially centre on three workshops and film screenings in London (November 2010), Adelaide (January 2011) and Conegliano/Venice (July 2011). It will pool the expertise of cinema scholars, film directors, members of Italy's immigrant communities, trade unions, environmental groups, and representatives of the Partito di Alternativa Comunista, the party emerging in 2006 following a schism within the Partito della Rifondazione Comunista. Input from the Oscar-winning director Giuseppe Tornatore, via recorded interviews, will also inform the project. At each event, the ongoing work of researchers in the field of modern Italian cinema will be integrated with the personal testimonies and individual experience of the workshop facilitators to form a group analysis of the socio-political issues that have characterized a range of contemporary Italian films, many of these questions also being relevant to the UK and other film-producing nations. These questions include: the problematic integration of immigrants in post-industrial society; the vulnerability of both the bourgeoisie and working classes in a context of declining job security; the social repercussions of profit accumulation prevailing over environmental protection; the implications of Berlusconi's political, economic and cultural influence upon society as evidenced both directly and indirectly through the medium of film. The workshops will be open to all and their different locations will facilitate access to the project for its participants. and reduce their travel costs. Subsequently, an international conference at the University of Salford (January 2012) will advance the network's research within a more structured context. Research findings will eventually be disseminated via the University of Salford's Working Papers series, a published volume of essays in Italian, a monograph in English, and a dedicated, open-access website in English. There will also be further bi-annual events during the subsequentphases of the network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. The wider public will benefit from the network's findings as the events and publications will sensitize individuals to: the manner in which socio-economic and political issues are articulated on screen; the problems faced by radical film-makers and producers in accomplishing their projects; the ways in which cinema is conditioned by political and economic factors. The network's open-access website, containing key material from the workshops and conference, will be publicized during its events and may be consulted by the general public. \n\n2. Associations such as immigrant welfare groups, trade unions, environmental groups, and organizations for the protection of free speech will benefit from research detailing the way in which socio-economic and political issues are being a) portrayed in a mainstream medium such as cinema, and/or b) conditioned by state institutions and influential economic interests. The findings of the network will be relevant to such groups both in Italy and in countries across the developed world. \n\n3. Independent film-makers and producers, not just in Italy, will derive useful information from the network's events and publications, which will ascertain the ways in which the production and distribution of radical film projects in Italy is currently being hindered, and outline strategies to bypass these problems. \n\n4. Journalists from the Italian mainstream press who have reported on Italy's socio-economic problems and abuses of political power, e.g. the newspaper Repubblica, will be invited to attend the workshop in Italy and report on its findings as a first stage of information dissemination. Given the correlation between the investigations of newspapers such as Repubblica and the thematic remit of the network, it is envisaged that a beneficial synergy will be created. \n\nThe research will impact on the culture of all nations with an active film industry; \na) by identifying patterns and even prejudices in the way sections of Western society such as ethnic minorities and the economically vulnerable are depicted on screen; \nb) by establishing how socio-economic and political issues are explored - or deliberately overlooked - within the particular context of Italian cinema; \nc) by ascertaining the impact of factors that facilitate or hinder the elaboration of 'radical' film projects. \nThis research has implications for the UK and its film industry, for other film-making countries, and also for policy makers in all these countries, since it will identify how vulnerable groups such as asylum seekers and uncontracted workers are represented in the medium of cinema and, by implication, how they are perceived within the public imagination. Two years is a realistic timescale to organize the initial stage of public events, establish the open-access website, and publish the first written outputs. During this period, academics working on the project will develop a greater awareness of the socio-economic and political realities behind the films being analysed, and the professionals participating in the network will acquire a more global awareness of mainstream media representations of their specific area of expertise, e.g. the environment, employment rights. To maximize the impact of the network's research, it will be made available via: a) electronic resources (dedicated website in English); b) low-cost printed resources (University of Salford's Working Papers series); c) scholarly publications such as the projected edited volume and monograph. The Principal Investigator will be responsible for organizing and editing printed research outputs ranging from Working Papers to full-length monographs. To date, he has successfully negotiated five projects with three different publishers (Troubador, Peter Lang, Cambridge Scholars Press). Organization of the network's events will also be overseen by the P.I., who</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25948</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Flinders University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>A New Italian Political Cinema?</gtr:description><gtr:id>EC2AAE0C-E979-41C2-B3B7-F0190F9EFC87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Un nuovo cinema politico italiano', volume 1, ed. by W.

In particular, they have noted the sanitized and selective media/cinematic representations of issues on which they campaign - such as (im)migration to Italy - and have changed the emphasis of their campaigning to underline to a greater extent the unseen and lesser known factors affecting migrants' lives in Italy.

In turn, the PdAC and C.U.B. have brought several lesser known issues, such as the forced adoption of children who are sometimes removed from migrant families soon after they reach Italy, into the academic sphere. This has been achieved by writing essays on such themes for interdisciplinary volumes such as &amp;quot;Un nuovo cinema politico italiano?&amp;quot; Vol. 1.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D7E09CE1-C948-41F5-B8A6-4422DA33CC8C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>? Unlike political cinema in Italy forty years ago, Italian cinema today is an orphan of the political ideologies that animated the protest movements of the 60s/70s, and while a cinema predicated on socio-political themes can still be said to exist, it functions primarily at an intimate, personal micro level (this is the case for feature-length fiction) and often fails to connect the individual realities of people to broader macro-level political, social and economic phenomena.



? Political films and documentaries, particularly during the Berlusconi era, have often proved to be more effective in terms of political denunciation and what would traditionally be termed &amp;quot;investigative journalism&amp;quot; than the Italian press and news outlets (e.g. Sabina Guzzanti's 'Draquila', concerning state corruption in the aftermath of the Abruzzo earthquake).



? There is an evolving body of internationally recognized prize-winning Italian cinematic work - notably shorts and medium-length work - which is predicated on 'unfashionable' socio-economic issues; the socially marginalized in Italian society, the 'reception' (detention) centres for migrants, etc. Such projects never receive the finance to become full-length, commercial projects but play a role in raising public awareness of certain issues.



? We have identified several cases of films being made by certain individuals who are themselves directly affected by socio-economic problems and political events. One example is the short film 'A zupp &amp;egrave; fasul' made by the Ferrari car workers in Modena to highlight their battle against their management's attempts to impose less favourable working conditions. Should this evolve into a discernible tendency, it represents a fascinating development within film-making - with real-life individuals, in the middle of their own ongoing 'narratives', recording their experiences in a cinematic form.

 

? Within mainstream, commercial film projects, there is a tendency to focus on the more 'spectacular', visible aspects of socio-economic problems and to neglect issues which, paradoxically, affect far greater numbers of people. A key example is the issue of migration to Italy. Films tend to focus on the traumatic arrival of the migrant (e.g. Crialese's 'Nuovomondo') or the marginalization/exploitation of the migrant once s/he has entered the country. By contrast, issues such as the plight of tens of thousands of people of African origin who are born in Italy, individuals who are highly educated but who are denied Italian citizenship, are rarely publicized.



? The limited access and, indeed, exclusion of groups of film-makers from access to funds and resources is a more profound problem that is commonly imagined. Several workshop presentations and personal testimonies highlighted the ongoing difficulties faced by film-makers of non-Italian ethnic origins and by film-makers with political projects in gaining access to the Italian film industry's funds, resources and collaborative opportunities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research findings demonstrate the following points and can be referred to by policy makers in the following areas:



The relative autonomy of cinema as a means of communication and of diffusing information - particularly in an era during which media and news outlets have fallen under the control of political and entrepreneurial elites, not just in Italy, but elsewhere - must be acknowledged, protected and enhanced.



The results of the project indicate that there must be greater transparency in the allocation of film industry resources and increased access to such resources. This principally applies to Italy, but is also relevant to other countries.



Findings, based on personal testimony and analytical presentations during the project's events, suggest that increased resources within the arts should be dedicated to the creation and distribution of short and medium-length films. This is because their subject matter, particularly in socio-political contexts, tends to highlight issues that mainstream, feature-length work rarely explores.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E947CB99-43E1-4337-BF25-6E03D84EDDE0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://italianpoliticalcinema.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E3AFA7D6-00C4-4887-B541-6AB7A06C9ACD"><gtr:id>E3AFA7D6-00C4-4887-B541-6AB7A06C9ACD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Un Nuovo Cinema Politico Italiano?: Volume 1: Lavoro, Migrazione, Relazioni di Genere</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/75e2a873e166af6fbcab09390d07c52e"><gtr:id>75e2a873e166af6fbcab09390d07c52e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hope, William; d'Arcangeli, Luciana; Serra, Silvana</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-78088-541-4</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0724AA3E-EA67-4DA3-B835-8C21CE2B865F"><gtr:id>0724AA3E-EA67-4DA3-B835-8C21CE2B865F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Un Nuovo Cinema Politico Italiano?: Volume II: il passato sociopolitica o, il potere istituzionale, la marginalizzazione</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2d7d064c8505aabdaa4e660c9c315c1c"><gtr:id>2d7d064c8505aabdaa4e660c9c315c1c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hope William</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781783065318</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H033785/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E7378EED-C28D-4F1E-9E28-5D9E75964912</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Italian studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
