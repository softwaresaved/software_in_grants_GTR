These cells give rise to the three major cell types of the CNS: neurons (cells that process the information we receive from the outside world and control our behaviour), astrocytes (cells that provide support to the neurons) and oligodendrocytes (cells that form the insulating fatty myelin sheath around the neurons that ensures rapid electrical transmission of electrical impulses). Amazingly, all NSCs are endowed with identical genetic material (DNA), yet they generate many different types of neurons, distinct from each other in their physiological properties and wiring diagram, as well as an unknown number of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte subtypes. How is such cellular diversity achieved from a common set of precursors? The key mechanisms that control NSC differentiation (the generation of specialized cells from immature NSCs) are referred to as epigenetic mechanisms. Such mechanisms do not change the genetic material within the cells, but rather ensure that the right sets of genes are turned &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; or kept &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; within the differentiated cells. These different gene sets comprise the genetic programs that make the cell a neuron, oligodendrocyte or astrocyte. Understanding the epigenetic mechanisms that govern the process of differentiation will provide us with the possibility of manipulating NSCs to form specific cell types that may be required for future stem cell-based
therapies for neurological diseases - e.g. multiple sclerosis, injury, stroke and other neuro-degenerative conditions. We have recently discovered a novel protein, called Schwann cell factor 1 (SC1 or PRDM4) which is an epigenetic regulator of gene expression in developing NSCs. The levels of SC1 must be lowered in order for differentiation to begin. Therefore, SC1 might provide a novel target to direct differentiation of NSCs. However, we first need to understand how the activity of SC1 contributes to development in vivo. We found that SC1 binds to and acts in partnership with another protein, PRMT5, which is an enzyme that modifies chromatin (the complex of DNA and its protein wrapper) in an unusual way. This gives us a handle to start unravelling the mechanism of action of the SC1:PRMT5 complex and its biological consequences. Ultimately, we hope to gain information on how SC1:PRMT5 might be used in re-programming NSCs to adopt specific cell fates for cell replacement therapies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Recently, we provided evidence that a protein from the PRDM family of transcription factors, SC1/PRDM4, recruits a chromatin modifier, the histone arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, to maintain the undifferentiated cellular state of neural stem cells (NSCs). SC1 and PRMT5 protein expression is high in NSCs and proliferating glial (oligodendrocyte) precursors (OLPs). SC1 is down-regulated at the onset of neuronal or glial differentiation suggesting that control of the &amp;quot;stem-like&amp;quot; state of NSCs might be regulated by activity of the SC1:PRMT5 complex. This further suggests the possibility that the specific histone modification mediated by SC1:PRMT5 (H4R3me2s) forms part of the histone code &amp;quot;signature&amp;quot; of multipotent NSCs and that this modification might be inherited asymmetrically during neurogenic divisions of the NSCs. 
The aim of this investigation is to test this possibility in an in vivo animal model in which SC1 is conditionally ablated (SC1flox/flox) in the developing CNS. This conditional knockout will be used in combination with region- or cell type-specific Cre lines to ablate SC1 in specific populations of neural precursors in vivo, in order to investigate the downstream genetic and phenotypic consequences. Our main aims are:
1) to ablate SC1 in all cortical progenitors, by crossing SC1flox/flox mice with Emx1-Cre mice
2) to ablate SC1 in developing OLPs, by crossing SC1flox/flox mice with Sox10-Cre mice
3) to uncover cell type-specific gene networks defined by SC1:PRMT5-mediated deposition of H4R3me2s on a genome-wide scale. We will achieve this by Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) with anti-H4R3me2s antibodies, and RNA-Seq from SC1 null and wild type animals. The combined information from these screens will be used to test direct regulation of candidate genes by performing ChIP with anti-PRMT5 and anti-H4R3me2s antibodies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Regulation of gene expression underpins all biological processes in health and disease. Gene expression is controlled by 1) DNA sequence-specific binding proteins (transcription factors) and 2) chromatin folding and accessibility of DNA (epigenetics). Transcription factors modulate the activity of the basal transcriptional machinery upstream of genes. By binding to and recruiting chromatin modifier, they can also target epigenetic modifications to specific genes. Epigenetic mechanisms that influence the global structure of chromatin can affect many genes simultaneously. Both things go on in parallel with substantial cross-talk between these two levels of control. How a given programme of gene expression is established is therefore a complex genome-level problem and systems-level approaches are required to make progress in understanding the problem. 
Our research will cast light on how a novel histone modification - arginine methylation - is targeted to specific genes during NSC development, what genes are targeted and how the different patterns of gene activity are inherited (or modified) from one cell generation to the next. This impinges on the BBSRC priority area &amp;quot;Systems approaches to biological research&amp;quot; and will add substantially to our understanding of how patterns of gene expression are established and controlled, with far-reaching implications across biology and biomedicine. 
A major goal of stem cell research is to learn how to direct production of specific cell populations for regenerative medicine, e.g. to replace dying dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's, or myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). A thorough understanding of how programmes of gene expression are established is essential if we are to make strong progress towards this goal. Much effort is going into generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells for this purpose, but it is becoming clear that iPSCs do not regain the epigenetic state of genuine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This is likely to limit the therapeutic value of current protocols for iPSC production. By throwing light on how a potentially crucial form of epigenetic modification is controlled and by clarifying its role during NSC division and differentiation, our research will make a substantial and lasting contribution towards the common goal of stem cell-mediated regenerative medicine. Our proposed project therefore fits into the BBSRC priority area &amp;quot;Ageing Research: Lifelong health and well-being&amp;quot;, with special emphasis on &amp;quot;Developmental factors and health during ageing&amp;quot;.
The research is at the &amp;quot;basic science&amp;quot; end of the translational spectrum. However, it is directed to the heart of a crucially important biological problem that is bound to have a major influence on clinical practice. Immediate beneficiaries of our research will include the wider biological and biomedical research communities and charitable organizations dedicated to finding treatments for particular neurological disorders e.g., the MS Society, Autism speaks, Rethink, the Alzheimer's Society. These charities will communicate this to their stakeholders (patients, carers and medical professionals) who are eager to hear of advances in stem cell research and its potential applications. By opening up avenues for future drug discovery our work will also be of interest and benefit to the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, a new Research Assistant will be trained in the course of the project.
Stem cell research is a topical area of great interest to the public. Therefore, Dr Chittka runs a series of popular public seminars at a local secondary school to explain our research and help them appreciate the medical potential of stem cell research generally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>493584</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>493585</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC Project Grant (Histone arginine methylation and the control of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation)</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/J006602/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>FB666AC4-06DF-4911-A66A-89A1D23524CC</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Wellcome Trust Seed Award</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>The Wellcome Trust Ltd</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>201941/Z/16/Z</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6BC129C4-4F7F-484C-A40B-0E6E384D3BB9</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>At present, our research findings are at basic science end of the translational spectrum. However, we might have uncovered a new mechanism (protein arginine methylation, R-Me) that regulates neural stem cell (NSC) re-programming and this could have a major impact on the development of stem cell technology, including therapeutic applications of stem cells - for example, for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. 
During this research, Dr Chittka has engaged in a variety of public outreach activities:

1. She delivered lectures about her research to &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; level pupils at a London secondary school to introduce them to the highly topical issues surrounding of stem cell biology and re-programming for therapeutic purposes and in regenerative medicine. Following from these lectures, several pupils came to UCL to try their hand at laboratory benchwork.

2. She hosted a secondary school pupil as part of the UCL-run &amp;quot;in2science&amp;quot; outreach programme, which allows able pupils from underprivileged backgrounds to gain first-hand experience of laboratory-based research.

3. She hosted a Biomedical Sciences BSc student from Anglia Ruskin University during Summer 2014 for a research project, which ultimately helped the student make a successful application to the MSc Regenerative Medicine programme at Imperial College.

4. She trained an intern, Ms Hale Tunbak who volunteered in the lab for approximately 6 months before being employed on the project as a technician. Ms Tunbak is currently applying for PhD positions at UCL and elsewhere.

5. She helped train a technician, Ms Christiana Georgieu, in molecular cell biology.

Together, these outreach activities are likely to contribute the economic competitiveness of the UK insofar as they serve as a platform for educating young people in the STEM fields necessary for competitive edge in the modern day economy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5B12E65B-6AEC-41D6-9F29-F631B021C768</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our goal was to test the idea that a protein complex between the transcriptional regulator PRDM4 and a chromatin modifier, protein arginine methyltransferase-5 (PRMT5), maintains the &amp;quot;stem-like&amp;quot; state of neural stem cells (NSCs) during brain development in vivo. We set out to test this idea, using mice in which the PRDM4 gene can be conditionally deleted (&amp;quot;knocked out&amp;quot;) from all cortical NSCs by crossing PRDM4(flox) mice with the Emx1-Cre transgenic mouse strain. We analyzed changes in 1) the expressed genes (transcriptome) and 2) arginine-methylated (R-Me) proteins of the conditional knockout (cKO) mice by high-throughput approaches. Analysis of the transcriptome data is in progress. The R-Me screen identified a number of candidate proteins with &amp;gt;2.5-fold changes in the levels of different classes of arginine methylation. Intriguingly, we found a reciprocal relationship between the numbers of mono-methylated substrates (higher) and di-methylated substrates (lower) in the PRDM4 cKO mice, strongly suggesting that PRDM4 targets PRMTs to specific proteins to mediate di-methylation of those proteins. Unexpectedly, the majority of proteins with significantly changed levels of R-Me are implicated in various aspects of RNA biology, which is known to be important in certain neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, our initial characterization of embryonic cKO mouse brain indicates that the layering of cortical neurons is disturbed, suggesting that R-Me is important for normal brain development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research is uncovering novel regulatory pathways in neural stem cell (NSC) biology, with potential implications for both normal neural physiology and for a variety of neurological diseases. Our proteomic screen, aimed at identifying proteins with significant changes in various types of arginine methylation (R-Me) as a result deleting PRDM4 in NSCs, unexpectedly provided evidence that R-Me might control various aspects of RNA biology in the brain. We have also obtained preliminary evidence that R-Me impacts the normal development of cortical neurons, resulting in an altered layered structure of the cerebral cortex. If confirmed, these findings will have a major scholarly impact since we are still largely in the dark about the functional role R-Me during development. We are currently continuing to analyze the proteomic data with the aim of identifying potential mechanisms of PRDM4/PRMT5-mediated control of NSC &amp;quot;stemness&amp;quot; and differentiation. Dr A Chittka has initiated a number of collaborations with specialists in neurodegeneration and will continue with these collaborations in her future work, which we anticipate will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease and, in the longer term, to the identification of therapeutic drug targets for these diseases.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0265F23C-CBCB-4A56-A8F5-87DB3FFBBA57</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5648241D-CE34-4956-BE65-9CB9FE077743"><gtr:id>5648241D-CE34-4956-BE65-9CB9FE077743</gtr:id><gtr:title>Combining Double Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization with Immunolabelling for Detection of the Expression of Three Genes in Mouse Brain Sections.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d26c16af45fb9bb9f24cf4a8618126ce"><gtr:id>d26c16af45fb9bb9f24cf4a8618126ce</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jolly S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1940-087X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/20735367-445C-42D3-8848-121C1A562931"><gtr:id>20735367-445C-42D3-8848-121C1A562931</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evolution of the CNS myelin gene regulatory program.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Brain research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/08e3e9b152d63bb3495d9a000cd75f74"><gtr:id>08e3e9b152d63bb3495d9a000cd75f74</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-8993</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9525F7EF-4ADF-48EB-AB6A-03652372F853"><gtr:id>9525F7EF-4ADF-48EB-AB6A-03652372F853</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identification of Prdm genes in human corneal endothelium.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experimental eye research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e2fabc5d74a0d2656f66de03668d752e"><gtr:id>e2fabc5d74a0d2656f66de03668d752e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rolev K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0014-4835</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2C38F12F-E593-4A16-8EB7-D6E0C97C44A5"><gtr:id>2C38F12F-E593-4A16-8EB7-D6E0C97C44A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Zinc fingers 1, 2, 5 and 6 of transcriptional regulator, PRDM4, are required for its nuclear localisation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bb3c7a209d579a28fd2cf352ce82b94f"><gtr:id>bb3c7a209d579a28fd2cf352ce82b94f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tunbak H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-291X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A0385F26-481A-4D52-A5A2-3F2AACCE646D"><gtr:id>A0385F26-481A-4D52-A5A2-3F2AACCE646D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transcription factor positive regulatory domain 4 (PRDM4) recruits protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) to mediate histone arginine methylation and control neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/015f534caf5ff87f852f28d6416cfde5"><gtr:id>015f534caf5ff87f852f28d6416cfde5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chittka A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/J006602/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CF8D454F-63BF-45A6-8974-473A3150758A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stem cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
