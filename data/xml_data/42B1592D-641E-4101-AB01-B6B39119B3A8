This often involves the use of long-established strains, because it has proved difficult to produce new, improved strains for many species. However, we have developed a technology allowing us to sexually cross certain fungi used in the food industry and shown that this results in the generation of offspring with enhanced properties for use in food production. This includes production of strains with pleasurable novel flavours and appearance, and lowered toxin content. We now plan to take these strains and screen and develop them for commercial exploitation. We also plan to make more crosses to generate offspring with other favourable features, such as higher enzyme activity and growth rate that might reduce manufacturing costs. All the novel strains will be screened in food production trials in collaboration with food industry partners, with taster panels used to test and confirm the appeal of the new strains and related food products.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>211186</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>New Food Innovation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Industrial and academic collaborations to test and manufacture novel fungal strains</gtr:description><gtr:id>77F761AC-C9E6-4EB6-9097-A53151374A45</gtr:id><gtr:impact>(1) Full-scale production trials have been performed with a sub-set of novel fungal strains previously identified.

The patent related to the invention of novel Penicillium strains, the production of novel Penicillium strains, and the use of novel Penicillium strains, in particular in the production of cheese. The application covered 22 pages including text and supporting scientific data. The patent had two main claims:
(1) The invention provides a method of producing strains of Penicillium by sexual reproduction. Specific methodology relating to sexual crossing methods was claimed, and the outcome that preferably the strain produced by sexual reproduction has a novel flavour profile; preferably this flavour profile is different to that of either parent used in the sexual cross. Biochemical methods to distinguish the novel strains were described. Strains produced by the crossing method might be used in the production of foodstuffs and cheese in particular. Alos the production of other useful metabolites wuth possible health beneficial properties, lower mycotoxin content and altered enzymen activity.
(2) A method of producing a novel fungal strain with change in the colour of the spores produced was also claimed, using strains derived from sexual crossing. This comprised the step of mutating the strain to a novel colour, with examples provided.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E4E650F-7BFF-44C2-8443-092F35DE6A55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Have ongoing discussions with commercial partners about a possible spin-out company or technology translational partnership.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:patentId>1520209.6</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Novel Fungal Strains for Cheese</gtr:title></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research project is still ongoing so only key findings to date are recorded below, with more to follow. Work concerns the development and screening of novel strains of the fungus Penicillium roqueforti for use in the cheese industry.
(1) Strain development. Have screened 60 sexual progeny of fungus Penicillium roqueforti from Stilton x Roquefort and Gorgonzola x Roquefort crosses. Through lab work (GC-MS) and cheese taste trials using cheese made with partner Highland Fine Cheese, have identified 3 strains so far (A7 mild, A22 strong, B20 sweet and mild) with novel flavours for possible commercialisation. All ranked above almost all current production strains, and one (B20) won silver medal (and top blue cheese in Scotland) when entered 'unofficially' in the national cheese awards summer 2016. Toxin tests are underway, preliminary analysis suggest all 3 strains have minimal mycotoxin levels i.e. safe for cheese consumption.
(2) Strain screening. Are currently screening a further 90 sexual progeny from Stilton x Roquefort and new Gorgonzola x Stilton crosses. Have so far identified 2 further novel strains (C6 classic Stilton but less pungent, C16 unusual camembert like) from taste trials for possible commercialisation.
(3) Strain isolation. Shropshire field isolations. Isolated at least 6 Penicillium roqueforti strains from field site in Shropshire. Keen for use by local cheese manufacturer but requires mycotoxin and taste testing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The strains that have been, and are being, developed might be used for future commercial production of novel cheeses.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FF6240D3-5157-4A85-9FD1-4575F383577D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/162DC0BC-3C32-4CEB-9A6F-B5E5897CDF1B"><gtr:id>162DC0BC-3C32-4CEB-9A6F-B5E5897CDF1B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparative genomics reveals high biological diversity and specific adaptations in the industrially and medically important fungal genus Aspergillus.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Genome biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1af57948b4203246f7d38c3a3db538b8"><gtr:id>1af57948b4203246f7d38c3a3db538b8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>de Vries RP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1474-7596</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N012631/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
