DC that are grown in culture can be readily used to protect mice against transplanted tumours, and have shown some efficacy in clinical trials for treatment of human cancer. However, it is now essential to refine our current suboptimal approaches in animal models that more closely resemble the human situation. This project will investigate DC-based therapies in a mouse model of breast cancer that is also relevant to other types of cancer. Specifically we will identify combinations of chemical agents that will make the DC more efficient at triggering anti-tumour responses; find ways of overcoming cells that may normally inhibit them, and of stimulating others to help; and investigate how we can encourage potentially beneficial cells to enter the tumours in order to destroy them and give long-lasting protection against recurrence of cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Dendritic cells (DC) induce and regulate many types of immune response, and there is considerable interest in their potential use for immunotherapy of cancer. DC grown from progenitors and exposed to tumour antigens can be used for prophylactic vaccination of animals against transplanted tumours, and the first clinical trials of DC-based immunotherapy have yielded promising results in some patients with advanced cancer. However there is a pressing need to refine these currently suboptimal approaches in animal models that more closely resemble the human situation, particularly for therapeutic vaccination against more advanced spontaneous tumours. 

This project focuses on immunotherapy of HER-2-transgenic Balb-neuT mice that develop spontaneous, highly aggressive mammary carcinomas that closely resemble many breast cancers. This presents a formidable challenge because of powerful mechanisms of self-tolerance against the oncogene that include apparent deletion of high affinity CD8 T cell clones, and emergence of regulatory T cells (Treg) as disease progresses. Vaccination of younger mice with, for example, adenovirally-transduced DC that express HER-2 can prevent carcinogenesis, but has little effect in mice with more advanced disease. Depletion of Treg unmasks a natural (low affinity) CD8 T cell response against HER-2 that could have therapeutic potential if these clones could be efficiently stimulated to develop into CTL and/or memory T cells, and be recruited into the tumours. 

Our goal is to develop DC-based or other immunotherapeutic strategies that can be used successfully to treat Balb-neuT mice with more advanced disease. We hypothesise that the efficacy of immunotherapy may be enhanced by a) optimising the vaccine such that tumour-specific CTL with full cytotoxic activity and memory CD8 T cells can be effectively induced; b) eliminating Tregs that are generated during disease progression, and which may otherwise inhibit anti-tumour responses; and c) promoting better access of effector and/or memory cells into the tumours. 

Our aims are to i) treat DC in vitro with combinations of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and/or other agonists and evaluate their capacity to induce CTL and memory CD8 T cells in vivo and to assess their therapeutic potential in Balb-neuT mice; ii) treat mice with agonists in vivo with antigen alone or as adjuncts to DC-based immunotherapy to overcome Treg activity and/or activate iNKT cells to enhance anti-tumour responses; and iii) modulate the tissue-homing properties of effector and memory CD8 T cells, and trace their homing into mammary tumours of pseudopregnant or hormone-treated mice, before and after delivery of chemokines.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>543481</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Transgenic mouse strain that spontaneously develops mammary carcinoma with early metastes</gtr:description><gtr:id>AD672BE1-52F9-43E0-9308-8CF25B24088E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We understand research is in progress using this model</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Model of Breast Cancer Metastasis</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0700072</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>DD81206B-5EB4-4BCC-AEF7-808A64606E0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.2  Cellular and gene therapies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
