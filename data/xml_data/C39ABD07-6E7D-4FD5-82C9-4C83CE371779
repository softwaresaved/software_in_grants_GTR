design</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N005880/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project will investigate if crowdsourcing can be used to aggregate the content of disparate, open-data sources across the internet to determine which patents underpin commercial products, and organise and present these according to technical criteria in a visual &amp;quot;gallery&amp;quot; form appropriate for engineering design.

Patents are frequently used to quantify levels of innovation associated with specific regions or companies. However despite the development of sophisticated data mining tools to support the analysis of over 50 million online patent records, little is known about which patents are actually &amp;quot;commercialized&amp;quot; and how they are embodied in commercial products. Because of this &amp;quot;patent informatics&amp;quot; has been inherently limited to the study of the records, rather than the use, of Intellectual Property (IP). This information gap inevitably reduces the accuracy of academic and commercial analysis that use patent data for applications such as innovation research, R&amp;amp;D fore-sighting, and IP portfolio valuations. Furthermore, the presentation of existing data maps is not in a form that is useful for engineering designers when conceptualising and embodying products: it is predominantly text-based (and often deliberately obfuscated) when more visual presentation with exemplars and appropriate technical taxonomic terms would greatly enhance utility when undertaking engineering design development.

Crowdsourcing utilises large networks of open people to compete discrete tasks. Virtual tools are used to co-ordinate the distribution, payment and co-ordination of results, resulting in a labour market that is open 24/7 and a diverse workforce available to perform tasks quickly and cheaply. The distributed network of human workers provide on-line, &amp;quot;black-box&amp;quot;, reasoning capabilities that could far exceed the capabilities of current AI technologies (i.e. genetic algorithms, neural-nets, case-based reasoning) in terms of flexibility and scope. 

This project proposes that crowdsourcing can be utilised to access open data sources such as user manuals, product labelling, court proceedings and company web pages to understand which patents are actively used in current products and how they have been embodied. With a more accurate representation of innovation commercialisation, technical metadata (labelling), and utilisation, we envisage patent searches not as a stage-gate check but as a revitalised source of design inspiration. Indeed, if crowdsourcing proves a cheap, scalable way of collating this information and applying appropriate taxonomic and visual engineering information, it could fundamentally alter the early phases of engineering design. To this end, the project will result in a visualization tool that can be used to both guide and inspire design conceptualisation and embodiment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's results will deliver impact to engineering designers, innovators, government policy and academic researchers in the following ways:

1. Engineering designers - The project will result in improved performance during the conceptual phase of engineering design. This will be achieved by delivering technical patent visualisation maps/galleries that designers can utilise as a reference and source of inspiration when undertaking design work. This will increase competitiveness by shortening the development cycle and producing better design solutions. We will share the results of the research through academic journals and conferences to allow other groups to implement similar crowdsourcing techniques to extract the maximum value from the current patent databases. The formulation of visual galleries and maps to support technical problem solving, however, could be an aspect to the work that can be packaged as a tool with commercial value. This will be assessed at the end of project Phase 3. 

2. Innovators - Innovators in general will be able to identify the strengths and limitations of existing patents more easily by investigation of the physical products that embody them. The members of the project's steering committee who are all professionally involved in the effective use of IP support of innovators will facilitate this on a practical level with the research team presenting the principles of crowdsourcing and patent visualisation to the wider academic community. 

3. Government policy - The results have the potential to significantly impact on policy and procedure in regards to patent management. As we have outlined in the case for support, there have been recent moves in the US to assess how crowdsourcing can be used to derive more meaningful information from the existing patent databases. If the proposed protocol proves successful, this could be applied to areas beyond engineering design and influence how governments and patent offices utilise data information as a means of innovation measurement. The project steering committee includes representatives from an executive agency (Intellectual Property Office), a public body (Scottish Enterprise) and a commercial patent attorney (Marks &amp;amp; Clerk). Ensuring the voices of all these groups are heard during the development and formulation of the crowdsourcing protocol is critical in ensuring the proposed approach is viable. The four steering committee meetings will act as a forum to review state-of-the-art and trends in patent policy, and also provide access to end users (patentees). By applying the initial results of the research within the steering committee members' organisations, we can assess reaction and effectiveness of the work, and inform our wider approach to impact.
 
4. Academic researchers - Those investigating the economic impact of patents will have quantifiable data on the products associated with particular patents. The data set generated through project Phase 2 (Scale up and benchmark) will be made available through the project website for others to download and utilise. Dissemination on the application of crowdsourcing process will be via conference presentations and specialist journal papers (e.g. World Patent Information). Similarly, the presentation of the patent visualization method and its implications for the design process will be presented to engineering design researchers via high impact journals such as Design Studies and Research in Engineering Design. Publication activities will be led by the PI with support from the RA and the rest of the academic team.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183254</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mines ParisTech</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Emerging collaboration with MINES ParisTech to explore the use of alternate design theories in the crowd platform to extract patent knowledge</gtr:description><gtr:id>D87AAB18-4C1E-409F-B28A-98EB2CCFC723</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Initial experimentation work completed, planned joint publication in 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Expertise in C-K Theory.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Emerging collaboration to explore the use of alternate design theories in the crowd platform to extract patent knowledge.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project steering group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3F8A81B-C6CA-4956-89A1-848124634FC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project steering group consists of representatives from Scottish Enterprise, the Intellectual Property Office and HGF patent attorneys.

The project was innovative in utilising crowdsourcing as the means to identify and organise relevant patents for use in the engineering design process. Given the potential advantages of aggregating human insight to overcome the limitations of computer algorithms and experts, the aim was to establish this as a cheap, scalable way of finding, collating and applying appropriate taxonomic engineering information via patents. The project has:
? Identified a 'search, cluster, utilise' thematic structure for the exploitation of patents
? Developed a new research platform with appropriate crowd workflows 
? Evaluated clustering protocols for the crowd to effectively group and prioritise patent sets 
? Identified 'collaborative tagging' as a novel means to facilitate patent searching
Thematic structure The project began by identifying key themes: finding relevant patents (searching), organising groupings in relation to particular problems (clustering), and applying these in engineering design activities (utilising). It is clear that although computational algorithms are maturing, human intervention remains essential to develop appropriate search strategies and to bring insight to patent clusters. Additionally, while there are various procedural approaches for the use of patents in the early phases of the design process (e.g. TRIZ, forced analogy, relational words), there is limited guidance on how unabstracted design knowledge can be extracted and applied. Four engineering activities across the development process have therefore been identified as a basis for exploration: scoping (opportunities and constraints), generation (inspiration and functional coupling), embodiment (context and object-oriented views) and testing (checking and commercialisation assessment).

Research platform A major output of the feasibility study is the creation of a software interface to manage the distribution, execution and aggregation of patent-related tasks to the crowd. The system allows online workers from established public platforms (e.g. Amazon's mTurk and Crowdflower) to engage in tasks much more complex than their normal work. It features visually-orientated assessment and organisation, the ability to filter crowd workers based on performance, and integration with appropriate payment systems. The basic architecture has been constructed using open source applications. The software has allowed the effectiveness of different approaches to clustering to be tested while also proving support for search, back-end processes and presentation of results. The platform will allow future experiments to be quickly implemented and trialled. 

Clustering Patent clustering helps identify meaningful patterns for forecasting technological trends, detecting infringement, and identifying technological vacuums. It has, however, consistently proved difficult to develop useful and consistent groupings, and is resource intensive. We therefore performed comparative analyses of the crowd with design experts, computer algorithms and commercial landscaping software within a 45-patent subset to assess its benefits. This included the use of data from previous research published by Fu et al. on computationally structured databases. The results for the 45-patent benchmark showed that the crowd workers created distinct and functional cluster labels with speed and cost benefits. Collaborative tagging We have identified a novel approach to the sourcing of patents - what we have termed 'collaborative tagging'. This provides the crowd with diagrammatic layouts or assemblies that describe the problem or product in question, with patents then sourced and mapped as shown in the Figure 1 'Search' theme. We anticipate combining this with wider, 'blue sky' searches and articulating it with the cluster protocols described above. 
Conclusions and initial impact The project has had allowed us to demonstrate the economic and intellectual viability of a crowdsourcing approach to the organisation of patents. The emergent themes have assisted the Weir Group in understanding patent management issues (mapping to products, unused patents, cross-domain applications) as well as demonstrating the cost benefits of crowdsourcing in comparison to using IP consultants and bespoke software platforms. It has highlighted a number of other industrial tasks such as patent status monitoring, geographical spectrum expansion, and technology scanning which Weir Group are currently following-up internally. In terms of outputs, a research tool (i.e. the software platform) with significant potential for expansion has been constructed, allowing patents to be utilised more effectively in a range of engineering design activities. The economic and time benefits in relation to clustering activity have been benchmarked for a given data set, and a potentially innovative approach to searching identified for further development. Other project impacts include:
? Staging of four project steering committee meetings which have provided a platform for discussion and developed relationships across the partner organisations.
? Dissemination at two international conferences (IPDMC Glasgow and DCC16 Chicago).
? Facilitation of MSc group project for Weir Group entitled 'Managing IP for Innovation'. Subsequently Weir funded two of the group as interns to further develop the findings.
? Employment of a summer intern who explored 'search by image' strategies, producing a workflow for better patent searching and fed into the collaborative tagging research theme.
? Inclusion in the University's 'Images of Research' photographic exhibition, with accompanying video and literature on project aims.
? Participated in Strathclyde Institute of Operations Management showcase event around the manufacturing themes of productivity, sustainable business models and leadership.
? Emerging collaboration with MINES ParisTech to explore the use of alternate design theories in the crowd platform to extract patent knowledge.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D337F99C-7361-48BE-9188-5258F2F2E62F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Today although there are over 50 million online patent records instantly available, understanding of their impact on innovation has never been harder. The volume and language of patents combine to make interpretation of their contents and assessment of their significance in the context of any given project a laborious process. The problem is exemplified by so called &amp;quot;patent thickets&amp;quot; defined as &amp;quot;a dense web of overlapping intellectual property rights that a company must hack its way through in order to actually commercialize new technology&amp;quot; (Shapiro, 2000). Given this designers need new tools to allow them to quickly and accurately understand the &amp;quot;patent landscape&amp;quot; in the context of a new design or innovation. 
This research investigates the feasibility of using a crowdsourcing process to cut through the patent jungle and deliver concise summary of the relevant Intellectual Property and its applications in an area of interest. Key components in crowdsourcing workflows are repletion (i.e. multiple, parallel tasks to generate sets of &amp;quot;answers&amp;quot;), peer review and merger, iteration, and the linkage of payment to quality assessments. This proposal seeks to quantify how well these techniques could be used to locate relevant patent records, summarize their contents and collaboratively construct infographic that shows the relative strength of clustering around topics. In other words the project will focus on the use of the crowd to provide the designer with two specific areas of functionality: 1) Patent Landscape Visualisation; 2) Patent usage assessment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work is cross-disciplinary and while the output of the research is aimed towards the engineering design community, the results will be of interest to researchers in a number of different fields. Firstly, the construction of an appropriate task template for distribution to the crowd will be of interest to researchers in the growing field of crowdsourcing. Framing of tasks, identifying reliable crowd members, setting an appropriate reward structures are all challenges that beset crowdsourcing activities, irrespective of the field of application. Secondly, this work has implications for researchers in patents and innovation, particularly in relation to informatics. Patents are widely used as a means to assess innovation activity but the clearer visibility of commercialisation patterns proposed by this research will introduce a new layer understanding. Finally, the project output in terms of patent visualisation will be presented for the engineering design community. Work on design methods through design conceptualisation and embodiment has highlighted the challenges of understanding competition and utilising relevant examples. The patent visualisation map/gallery will be aligned with current methods and presented as a new model for assessing the innovation landscape and facilitating concept generation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CBC88F50-6143-42FD-94FC-AB3E297354FD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed workflows that allow the task to effectively undertake clustering-related activity for patent analysis.
