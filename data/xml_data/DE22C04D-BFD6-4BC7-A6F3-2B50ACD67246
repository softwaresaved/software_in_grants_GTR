It does this using two major studies of children and young people, which have followed their experience through early childhood and adolescence. 

The Millennium Cohort Study has traced children born in 2000-2001 since they were nine months old, surveying their families when they were babies and visiting them again when they were aged 3, 5 and 7. The Longitudinal Study of Young People in England first surveyed a cohort of children in year 9, when they are were aged 13-14 and revisited them annually up till the age of 20/21. This analysis focuses on the surveys either side of the end of compulsory schooling, i.e. at age 14/15 and at age 16/17. 

The research has four main aims. First it engages with the question of what constitutes child disability looking at different definitions and measures, including children defined as having special educational needs (SEN). It looks at the overlap between different measures as well as at how much variation there is between children classified as disabled. It uses this information to group children by disability status, which is used in the rest of the study. It will also investigate the extent to which disabled children are adequantley represented in nationally representative longitudinal cohort studies. This element will enhance our understand the prevalence of disability at different ages, and according to different measures, which is informative for policy. It will also reveal the suitability of existing studies for disability research and how that might be improved. 

Second, the study explores the family backgrounds of disabled children, how these differ from non-disabled children in terms of risk factors such as living in a workless family, living in poverty and so on, and how this varies at different ages, both within and between the two studies. This helps us to understand the extent to which disabled children are more likely to be in disadvantaged families and the extent to which that increases (or decreases) as they grow older. This can inform identification of the circumstances of disabled children and hence potentially their support needs.

Third, it looks at trajectories of cognitive ability, given that disabled children and non-disabled children typically have different starting points. It investigates whether disabled children experience patterns of development that are comparable to those of non-disabled children, or whether their difficulties increase over time, and, indeed whether there are typical trajectories, given the varied nature of the disabled group of young people. This helps to identify the extent to which policy for and practice in support and intervention for disabled children facilitates their development or whether they are at risk of falling behind during the school years relative to how they start off.

Finally, it examines the extent to which disabled children have different educational outcomes and aspirations for continued participation in education following the end of compulsory schooling compared to non-disabled children, given the point they have reached by year 10 and their performance at key stage 3. It looks at factors which make a difference to their post-compulsory outcomes and that may be supportive of greater participation or better post-compulsory school outcomes. 

The project will be informed by the perspectives of disabled young people themselves, both in the design and interpretation of research and will be disseminated in policy briefings and an open meeting as well as through more academic routes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will generate impact among academics, disabled children and young people, practitioners, policymakers and funders. The research findings have the potential to change our conceptual understanding of what supports, experiences and environments affect disabled children and young people's lives, and will be instrumental in influencing policy and practice development. The findings may also build capacity among funders of research to consider new ways of including disabled children and young people in large surveys.

It will do this through the collaboration between the Institute of Education and National Children's Bureau (NCB), with NCB leading on most of the dissemination and impact activity. Specifically, in addition to the academic beneficiaries discussed above, the research will impact on a range of non-academic beneficiaries. It will impact on disabled children and young people directly through their participation in the research process, which will involve the two sessions with young people from NCB's Young Research Advisors (or a comparable group); and indirectly through the implications of the findings. The Young Research Advisors will also co-produce (with members of NCB) a young person's research summary and will assist in its dissemination. We will also provide accessible research updates to inform disabled children and young people of the project's progress.

It will impact on organisations and practitioners working in universal and specialist services through their increased knowledge on disabled children and young people's development and what supports maximise their development. They will be reached in a number of ways including: 
-The NCB members newsletter, which reaches 10,500 member contacts across the children's sector
-The Council for Disabled Children (CDC) Digest, which reaches over 800 member contacts and CDC's 50 member organisations
-NCB's member organisations' existing communication channels and information updates, such as the -Children's Society Disability Update, MENCAP Viewpoint, Allfie - Inclusion Now and Participation Works
-Press releases and social media updates from IOE's and NCB's communications officers
Research outputs will include a roundtable with senior CDC Council members. 

It will impact on policymakers through their increased knowledge on disabled children and young people's development. This will be achieved through a research briefing aimed at ministers and policymakers highlighting the policy implications and recommendations stemming from the research. CDC is Strategic Partner for SEN and Disability to DfE, which includes developing capacity and support within the sector and providing expert, professional advice to DfE. Using this link, we will ensure that DfE receive regular updates on the research and they will be invited to attend and speak at events and the roundtable with senior CDC Council members. We can provide a bespoke seminar to key DfE officials; and can feed in directly to DfE via the DfE-funded Centre for the Analysis of Youth Transitions (CAYT).

It will impact on funders through better understanding of the limits and possibilities of general purpose research studies to understand disabled children and young people's development. This will be achieved through reporting mechanisms currently in place that will be used to report back to funders on the research and its implications. Stakeholder events relating to future sweeps of the MCS and to other funded data resources will also provide an opportunity to discuss the implications of the research for instruments and for the future conduct of longitudinal data collection. The impact on funders is likely to be in the longer-term vis-a-vis the availability of funding for new surveys of disabled children and young people or more consideration of how to minimise attrition for families of disabled children and young people.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>88952</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Trajectories and Transitions Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E7D571A2-DF1C-420C-8E02-3B4149B59165</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Substantial questions after the event and some follow up as well as considerable taking-away of briefing papers and working papers.

The project findings were cited in a Government of Office Science PostNote on the new provisions relating to disabled children and young people coming in under the Children and Families Act 2014, and the project PI also contributed to the reviewing that PostNote. 
A 'round table' seminar to discuss the findings was held with practitioners and some policy makers in September 2014. This was held under the auspices of the Council for Disabled Children and informed their use and interpretation of the findings in future work and engagement with policy makers. 
A further seminar was given at the London School of Economics in November 2014, which was attended by policy-makers, academics and practioners working in the fields of disability, education, bullying etc. (e.g. SCOPE, Department of Health, DCLG, Nuffield Trust, Work Foundation, DWP, Alliance for Inclusive Education, Universities of Warwick and East London, UCL IOE etc.) and provoked substantial debate. 
The Department for Education requested and organised an internal seminar from the research team specifically for senior analysts and those in policy in relevant areas, including bullying as well as Special Educational Needs in January 2015. The DfE requested a further seminar presentation which took place in February 2017 and was attended by around 20 people from different departments of the DfE, including those working on social mobility and those working on SEN. The presntation contained updated findings from two strands of the project relating to educational development of children up to age 11 and from age 13/14 to age 19/20. 
The bullying research was presented at a Festival of Social Science event organised by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies and the Anti-Bullying Alliance in November 2015. This event attracted 130 people, mostly from the voluntary sector and provided considerable material for discussion and debate. The Anti-Bullying Alliance have taken the findings to heart and wish to repeat the event in future years, given how important is to share the evidence and how much appetite there is to know more about this area. 
Findings from the project overall were presented in a plenary talk at a one-day workshop in Cardiff on Promoting and Empowering the Rights of Disabled Children and Young People. THis event, which attracted around 120 policy makers, practitioners and representatives from voluntary sector organisations also involved disabled children and young people themselves. It provided the opportunity not only to share evidence on the various impacts of disability, but also to discuss their implications for practice and for the development of policy. 
The bullying results were the subject of a talk at a widening participation event to around 100 schoolchildren, which took place in Warwick and provided the opportunity to demonstrate in simple terms how quantitative analysis of (longitudinal) surveys can treat topics that are very gemane to students' lives - and facilitated them thinking about the role of research as well as the findings. 
The reach of the project and the findings is also demonstrated in an invitation to one of the team members to chair an Inside Government one-day event on Preventing and Tackling School Bullying. This event (which is taking place in December 2015) is targeted at head and deputy headteachers, heads of behaviour, anti-bullying co-ordinators, directors of education, education welfare managers, principals, heads of year, teaching assistants and e-safety co-ordinators from local authorities, schools including primary, secondary, independent and free and also the voluntary and private sectors. Dr Chatzitheochari, as chair of this event, will be responsible for chairing a panel of speakers, and also organising disucssion points and indicating the conclusions for those working in the field. 
There was substantial media coverage of both the findings relating to bullying and those relating to the development of behavioural problems. This stimulated contacts from policy and practitioner organisations across the UK, as well as from parents of disabled children. And many copies of the papers were requested or downloaded. 
Blogs e.g. on Society Central and dedicated coverage in other online 'magazines' stimulated further interest and contacts. 
Academic impact has been achieved through the above activities but also through a conference presentation at a conference on Social Stratification in Edinburgh in September 2014, and at invited seminars at the University of Oxford, the Institute of Education and the London School of Economics and Political Science, all in 2014. A poster of research from the project was presented at the Population Association of America annual conference in San Diego in 2015 and attracted some discussion. Working papers and articles continue to be downloaded; and, while the publication time lag means that papers in 2014 are not likely to be cited in any numbers, google scholar shows that our working papers are already being cited in other academic work.

The research was concerned to address whether childhood disability was linked to family socio-economic disadvantage, and whether, given differences in family background and context disabled children and young people faced different patterns of progression through education, even given that they were likely to start from different points. That is, it set out to investigate disabled children's eduational Trajectories and their educational Transitions. In addition, through the progress of the research, and prompted by discussions with our research partners, the Council for Disabled Children and with input from groups of disabled young people, we also investigated bullying risks among disabled children and the development of behavioural difficulties in the early years. We therefore ended up meeting more research objectives than we had originally specified. 

Focusing on England, we used two large-scale nationally representative longitudinal studies, the Millennium Cohort Study, covering ages nine months to 7 years, and the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, covering young people aged 13/14 to age 19/20. 

In discussion with the Council for Disabled Children, we developed and employed three broad overarching measures of disability, which showed some degree of overlap, but also identified different children. These were developmental delay measured at around nine months, long-standing limiting illness, which approximates to the legal definition of disability and special educational needs (SEN) with or without a statement of needs, which provides an indicator of severity fo their needs. Our key findings were as follows: 

Socio-economic disadvantange
Disabled children come from more disadvantaged backgrounds than non-disabled children. There is also some evidence that disadvantage increases among families with a disabled child.

Bullying
Disabled children and young people are more likely to be bullied than non-disabled children. These greater risks of bullying victimisation are partly accounted for by other characteristics than disability that also put the the child at higher risk of being bullied and which are more common among disabled children. However, disabled 7-year-olds remain more likely to be bullied than their otherwise similar non-disabled peers, and disabled teenagers are also more likely to suffer relational (i.e. non-physical) forms of bullying than their non-disabled peers. Morever, teenagers with or without a statement of special educational needs are also more likley to suffer physical bullying than their otherwise similar peers. 

Behavoural problems
We looked at four domains of behavioural problems measured across ages 3 to 7 using a recognised scale. These problem domains were conduct problems, peer problems, hyperactivity and emotional symptoms. We found that disabled children have more behavioural problems at age 3 than non-disabled children across these four domeains and these heightened behavioural problems can only partly be accounted for in terms of differences in family context. In addition, for peer, hyperactivity and emotional symptoms, problems seemed to get relatively worse for disabled children over the ages 3 to 7 for disabled children, while the gap for conduct problems between non-disabled and disabled children remained constant. These differences in the development of behavioural problems could not be explained in terms of differences in family charactersitics, parenting practice or home learning environment between disabled children and non-disabled children.

Educational development 
We explored cognitive and educational progress among young disabled children bewteen the ages of 3 and 5 and between the ages of 5 and 7. We used multiple measures of cognitive and educational attainment collected at the various ages. We started by ascertaining the extent to which disabled children have lower cognitive scores than non-disabled children prior to school entry at age 3; and found that disabled children have lower scores in cognitive tests on average at age 3. We then looked at their progress relative to childre who started from the same points as them. We found that, compared to children with similar scores at age 3, disabled children made less progress by age 5. Similarly, compared to children with lower educational and cognitive scores at age 5 they made less progress betwen the ages of 5 and 7, and, to a lesser extent between ages 7 and 11 This findings held even after controlling for family and individual background characteristics and whether or not we included children with cognitive disabilities in our overarching measures of disabled children. 

Educational transitions in the teenage years
Following on from some debates in current researcher, we explored whether disabled children had similar or reduced educational expectations compared to children who had similar educational attainment to them immediately prior to secondary school entry. We found that disabled young people had less ambitious educational expectations relative to non-disabled children with similar prio academic performance and controlling for socio-economic background. However, neither their lower educational expectations nor their earlier educational attainment explained their much lower chances of achieving 5 A*-C GCSEs at age 16. Moreover, even among those who did achieve the 'threshold' level of GCSEs at age 16, usually necessary for continuing into post-compulsory education, we found that disabled children had lower expectations of continuing into tertiary education than their non-disabled peers. Conditioning on GCSE attainment and on staying on in secondary school. Disabled young people were no less likely to continue into higher education than their non-disabled peers. Those who did so were highly selected, including in terms of SES background.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have already been used in a Government Office of Science POSTnote on the Special Educational Needs (SEN) reforms. 
They have also been shared widely among academic and policy and practitioner audiences.
The DfE has shown interest in the findings and continues to express in the latest results. 
Disabled parents and disabled children's organisations have expressed interest in and welcomed the results. 
They are being taking up by organisations addressing bullying among children and by organisations working with disabled children. They have potential to be of use to Educational Departments and may also be of value to parents of disabled children.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>40E7EE4F-D6B1-4964-A644-52C67B244684</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/childhooddisability</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/016FC229-9981-46B2-8466-364C682A03D4"><gtr:id>016FC229-9981-46B2-8466-364C682A03D4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disability among young children: Prevalence, heterogeneity and socio-economic disadvantage</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c2f00295e30fd936072a97767eee7708"><gtr:id>c2f00295e30fd936072a97767eee7708</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parsons, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/212EDAE7-8DC6-444A-8135-E34C39D5ACC7"><gtr:id>212EDAE7-8DC6-444A-8135-E34C39D5ACC7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disabled children's cognitive development in the early years</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/303a7b25235de0f1e35e6d6ee3b39c8d"><gtr:id>303a7b25235de0f1e35e6d6ee3b39c8d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parsons, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A666F554-A301-42F0-8A90-5043252B4FB5"><gtr:id>A666F554-A301-42F0-8A90-5043252B4FB5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Convergence or divergence?
