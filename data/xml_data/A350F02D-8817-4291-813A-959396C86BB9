This contains linked census records for over two million people in Britain between 1971 and 2011. The longitudinal structure of the LS will enable us to track people from childhood to adulthood, comparing the occupations they end up in at different points in their lives, to those of their parents decades earlier. We will use the LS to calculate and compare 'mobility rates' for cohorts of people born between the mid-1950s and the mid-1990s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The LS? very large sample size means that we will be able to draw very fine-grained and robust conclusions about trends in social mobility, not just for the population as a whole but for sub-groups defined by year of birth and type of social origin.&amp;nbsp; We will calculate mobility rates along three different metrics: occupational status, social class and income, in order to ensure that our findings address the key dimensions of people's social and economic position rather than focusing on only one, as has generally been the case in existing studies.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?

We anticipate that two main groups will benefit from this programme of research:

GROUP 1: Academic social scientists with substantive and methodololgical interests in intergenerational social mobility. This primarily comprises sociologists and economists but also includes demographers, social policy analysts, social statisticians and anthropologists. We expect that the approach we adopt in this research, which integrates econometric with more traditional sociological approaches to the estimation of mobility rates and trends, will serve to bring researchers from these disciplines into closer contact and to promote inter and cross-disciplinary reserach. The research will also highlight to academic researchers the utility of the ONS Longitudinal Study as a unique and under-utilised resource for longitudinal secondary analysis, including the addition of the 2011 data.

GROUP 2: Researchers and policy-makers in central and local government and third sector organisations with an interest in understanding and promoting social mobility in the United Kingdom. Because social mobility is a key focus of recent and current government policy, the findings of our research will be of interest to many government departments and ministries. In particular, our findings will benefit the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Office for National Statistics, who are both gathering evidence on social mobility to underpin the development of policy in this area. Our research will also be of benefit to third sector organisations such as the Sutton Trust. We have developed this proposal in light of discussions with both departments and with the Sutton Trust and all three have agreed to participate in the policy impact seminar, which is the key dissmination event for the project. We anticipate participation from additional government departments as well as researchers in local government and third sector organisations. Letters of support from the ODPM and the Sutton Trust are included as attachments to this proposal. 

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT?

GROUP 1: Our research addresses the acknowledged limitations of much of the existing literature on recent trends in inter-generational social mobility in the United Kingdom. In doing so, we hope to shed light on some key questions in this important field of study, which will be of benefit to all academic disciplines with an interest in social mobility. For example we will assess whether mobility rates and trends differ across measures of income, class and status. At present, the limitations of existing data sets mean that it has not been possible to adequately differentiate methodological from substantive variation. We will also, for the first time, be able to evaluate inter-cohort trends in mobility, with successive cohorts defined by year of birth. In turn, this will enable us to better understand the relative weights of period and cohort change underpinning mobility trends. 

GROUP 2: policy-makers and third sector organisations will benefit from this research because our goal is to resolve fundamental questions about the actual direction of social mobility in England over recent decades. The inconsistent and contradictory state of the existing evidence base makes it difficult for policy makers to understand the sorts of strategies that might or might not be effective in promoting social fluidity. Our research will, therefore, provide a firm base upon which to formulate future social policy in this area. Although our research is, by definition, backward-looking, we believe it is likely to provide insights into the effectiveness of potential policy interventions due to our ability to pinpoint changes in mobility rates at the level of annual cohorts; the points at which mobility rates increase or decrease between cohorts (if they do) will indicate likely locations of policy and other macro-level changes that exerted a causal influence on mobility.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98603</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobiliy</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B5525E01-6E41-40DA-B39F-072B62157B5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Patrick Sturgis gave a presentation on the findings of the project relating to trends in social mobility in England and Wales</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>presentation to House of Lords Select Committee on Social Mobility</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E0C0AA90-3563-4117-9425-2CA2DE9BF6C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>patrick Sturgis gave a presentation to the House of Lords select committee evidence gathering seminar 1 July 2015 on the findings of the project relating to trends in social mobility in England and Wales</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Our findings featured in a Radio 4 programme 'Analysis' on downward social mobility (8p, 16 February)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>471BD6C5-9587-4E29-AC28-6FA6639002B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our findings featured in a Radio 4 programme 'Analysis' on downward social mobility (8p, 16 February)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social Mobility Grinding to a Halt?

Yet the evidence underpinning this contention is, at best, weak. This is because the requirements for producing robust and accurate estimates of intergenerational social mobility are rarely met in most existing data sets. This symposium presents findings from two ESRC funded projects which make use of the UK's unique longitudinal data resources to provide new evidence on recent trends in social fluidity in the United Kingdom.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings featured in a Radio 4 programme 'Analysis' on downward social mobility (8p, 16 February). 

Our findings also contributed to a proposal by Baronness Claire Tyler for a House of Lords Select Committee on Social Mobility. The proposal was accepted and there is now a select committee. Sturgis gave evidence to the committee, drawing on the findings of this project, on 1 July 2015. Sturgis also gave evidence to the all party parliamentary group on social mobility 9 December 2015. Our project findings were cited in the annual report of the Commission for Social Mobility and Child Poverty, 'State of the Nation 2015: Social Mobility and Child Poverty in Great Britain'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B609376C-5DC7-4DDA-B39E-539BD320C162</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have found that, counter to popular belief, social mobility in the United Kingdom has not been slowing down or 'going into reverse'. In fact, we have found some evidence to suggest that social fluidity - the extent to which our life chances are determined by the socio-economic conditions we are born into - increased somewhat from the late 1950s to the late 1980s. 
We have also found evidence which shows that 'upward mobility' has declined somewhat amongst men but increased by about the same amount for women. Our results do not change appreciably when we used different measures of socio-economic position. 

We have also found that simply increasing the amount of education undertaken by the general population does not seem to increase social mobility. We did this by comparing the rates of social mobility by cohorts entering school before and after the compulsory school leaving age was increased from 15 to 16 in 1973. Although the later cohort received more education and achieved higher qualifications, we found no evidence to suggest that this improved social mobility.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings suggest that simple policy interventions which seek to increase educational participation are unlikely to have any effect on social mobility. For an education policy to have any chance of increasing social mobility, it is necessary for it to weaken the association between socio-economic origin and educational achievement. That is to say, it must reduce disparities in educational achievement by parental background. Even then, it is far from certain that social mobility will increase.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CC830C36-D8D4-42DF-9F13-50DE587D3380</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.intime.soton.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7BFC4316-F77E-4701-BACC-8359ECD59B56"><gtr:id>7BFC4316-F77E-4701-BACC-8359ECD59B56</gtr:id><gtr:title>Increasing inter-generational social mobility: is educational expansion the answer?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British Journal of Sociology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9e86aebf1bf4871171a176fad37d6bd5"><gtr:id>9e86aebf1bf4871171a176fad37d6bd5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buscha, F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E310EE0E-0BE9-4E62-A1E5-6AAC37353330"><gtr:id>E310EE0E-0BE9-4E62-A1E5-6AAC37353330</gtr:id><gtr:title>Buscha, Franz and Sturgis, Patrick (2015) Declining Social Mobility?
