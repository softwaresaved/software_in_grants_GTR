Trying to discover how this ability evolved is an extremely difficult challenge and it is a problem focussed on by scientists from a large number of disciplines. Recent genetic evidence indicates that we only developed the fine motor control necessary for spoken language in our very recent past. Given the extremely complex nature of language it therefore seems very likely that many of the elements of language and their underlying mental processes evolved much earlier in our evolutionary past. Examining the mental and communicative abilities of non-human primates allows us to identify elements of language that are evolutionarily old and shared with other primates and those which are novel inventions that are unique to humans. In any communicative act there are signal producers and receivers. To date, virtually all work in this field has concentrated on the receiver of signals and has been conducted with monkey species. Thus, we know very little about the signal producer and in particular, almost nothing about natural communication in great apes. In order to understand how language evolved we need to understand the mechanisms driving call production in non-human primates and specifically in the great apes. We propose a three-year research programme designed to probe the complexity of call production in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee. We shall do this by combining experimental and observational work with both wild and captive chimpanzee populations. We will firstly test whether wild chimpanzees have voluntary control over their calls and whether they choose to produce or suppress them in tactical ways. This will be achieved by playing the calls of a group member to simulate the arrival of that individual within the caller's vicinity and examine if the arrival of this individual affects the subject's decision to produce calls. These experiments build on substantial observational work that suggests some calls are produced in order to decrease threats from key individuals or strengthen social relationships with certain group members. Secondly, we will examine whether wild chimpanzees produce calls to inform others and whether these calls are recipient-directed signals. Chimpanzees travelling in different positions within a group will be presented with model snakes. This will allow us to determine the motivation underlying the production of alarm calls and the extent to which vocal behaviour is modified according to the behaviour of recipients of the calls. Lastly, we will investigate the flexibility and control captive chimpanzees have over the acoustic structure of their calls, in the context of matching their calls with others' for a specific event. Previously we found that captive chimpanzees produce distinct calls for specific types of food. This study will investigate how a group converges on a 'label' for a particular food by introducing a novel food to the group. This will enable us to chart how call structure changes as individuals hear the calls others produce to the novel food. Our results will indicate whether chimpanzees share any of the key hallmarks of human language production: voluntary control, production of recipient-directed signals, adjustment of vocal production according to the behaviour of the audience, modification of the acoustic structure of vocalisations to conform to a group norm. This could have profound implications for the debate on the evolution of language as it would show chimpanzees share crucial elements of vocal communication with humans.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The evolutionary roots of language are of enduring interest. Given its complexity, one powerful premise is that the cognitive underpinnings of language have their phylogenetic roots deep in the primate lineage. Previous research into primate vocal communication has focussed on monkey species and signal receivers. Consequently, we know little about (i) the natural vocal communication of great apes; species pivotal for theories of language evolution, or (ii) the cognitive mechanisms underlying primate call production. Are vocalisations individualistic emotional responses to events, or are they intentional communicative signals? We propose a three-year experimental and observational research project to investigate whether chimpanzees produce voluntary, recipient-directed signals, if these calls are given to inform others about external events and if they can be flexibly modified to conform with group conventions. Experiments will be conducted with wild chimpanzees in Budongo Forest, Uganda, producing results of the optimum kind: rigorous yet ecologically valid. To explore the voluntary and tactical production of vocalisations we will simulate the arrival of individuals into the subject's vicinity with a playback paradigm and monitor how this affects subsequent vocal behaviour. To test if chimpanzees can produce intentional, recipient directed calls, to inform others of external events, chimpanzees in various spatial arrangements will be presented with model snakes. We will film the individual discovering the snake, focussing on whether the behaviour and attentional focus of call recipients is monitored and if the audience's behaviour influences vocal production. Lastly, to assess how individuals converge on a group call for particular events, we will conduct a captive observational study. This project as a whole will be the first to systematically test the mechanisms underlying call production in apes. Results will significantly impact on language evolution theories.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>291022</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Creation of teaching resources</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E14B7CB-A5B9-4FBA-86D4-B44D665B7195</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2012 I worked with colleagues at the Living Links to Human Evolution Research Centre at Edinburgh Zoo to produce a teacher resource pack on primate vocal communication.

Although a gestural origin of language has been supported by evidence of great-apes producing gestures intentionally, comparable evidence for-great-ape vocalisations was lacking. We addressed this with two field-experiments: (1) Playback experiments revealed that chimpanzees direct their food-associated calls at high ranking friends, indicating these calls are selectively produced and socially targeted, rather than reflexive responses to food, and (2) Presentations of python models demonstrated that chimpanzee alarm calls met established markers of intentional communication. Like gestures, these vocalisations were (i) socially directed at the arrival of friends, (ii) associated with visual audience checking and gaze alternations, and (iii) goal directed: calling only stopped when recipients were safe from the predator. These studies show that our closest living relatives' vocal production is recipient directed and intentional, challenging gestural and supporting vocal theories of language evolution.
In addition we conducted a study with captive chimpanzees showing that there is more flexibility than previously thought for chimpanzees to alter the structure of their referential food calls: this is the first evidence of vocal learning influencing the structure of meaningful referential calls in any non-human primate calls.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have showcased how to
