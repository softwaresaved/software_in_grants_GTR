This project will obtain accurate data on the practical performance of graphene electrodes within a supercapacitor device
on a scale that is of technological interest for real world application. This will be achieved through R&amp;amp;D activities in
graphene inks production and integration of graphene inks into electrodes for subsequent manufacturing of supercapacitor
coin and pouch cells. The specific application of such devices is in energy storage for low carbon vehicles. The project
directly answers the key question of whether graphene will retain its novel properties when manufactured into real products
for practical applications. Research activities are targeted at identifying the choice and quality of graphene, manufacture
and optimise graphene inks and electrodes for a real supercapacitor device. A Key innovation will be an integrated material
sciences and scale-up engineering approach from materials to manufacturing in order to translate the performance benefits
of graphene from lab discovery into real products.
The Warwick University contribution cross-cuts the complete project programme and aims to deliver a fundamental
advancement in the strategic integration of material science and manufacturing capability within the UK. A key contribution
is the development of a comprehensive methodology for the high throughput assessment of graphene cells, which will
relate the graphene grade and manufacturing method with the energy and power density characteristics of the graphene
devices. Through the unique facilities and industry/academic networks within the WMG High Value Manufacturing (HVM)
Catapult, a real-world demonstration of the successful scale-up and subsequent characterisation of new graphene based
energy storage devices (button cells and supercapacitor cells) will drive confidence within keys sectors (e.g. transport and
energy), accelerate graphene research and stimulate a UK supply-chain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Consortium Partner
DZP Technologies Ltd (DZP) have been developing graphene materials for the last two years (supported in part by TSB
funding) using graphene synthesis and graphene printing applications. Despite significant technical progress achieved by
the company (and in fact, other producers and developers of graphene), commercialising graphene has proved difficult
because of the lack of confidence by the end users in the actual performance of graphene when scaled-up and
manufactured to meet a real-world problem. DZP have identified significant market and supply chain gaps which so far
have prevented the wider adoption of graphene technologies. The company now considers these markets, combined with
the lack of incumbent players, as a unique business opportunity for the company to grow by expanding its supply chain
position, and becoming a provider of graphene technology solutions (rather than just graphene material). This research will
provide the pre-requisite evidence for the manufacturability of graphene and its performance capabilities when embedded
within a new energy storage device. This evidence will underpin DZPs strategic objectives defined above.
UK Supply Chain
This research further supports the strategic integration of material science, engineering and high value, sustainable,
manufacturing. The research accelerates the formation of a UK based supply chain that is focussed on the technology
scale-up of graphene materials into new products and services. The clear demonstration of graphene based energy
storage devices for the demanding low carbon transport sector will drive end-user confidence with spill-over opportunities
for those organisations (largely UK based high technology SME's ) in others sectors. This research will impact electric and
hybrid marine (such as boats and submarines) that are estimated to be worth over $7.3 billion by 2024, and unmanned
aerial vehicles that are predicted to reach over $1 billion by 2023 (idtechex.com) and consumer electronics (that have a
continual demand for mass and volume de-compounding combined with high energy and power density).
Professional Training
The research milestones will feed directly into the syllabus content of professional educational programmes (at Masters
level) on energy systems, energy materials and advanced manufacturing methods. Companies will benefit from staff with
improved knowledge and skills, with the potential to stimulate shorter-term impact in the commissioning, design and
manufacture of new energy storage technologies.
Public
The wider public will better appreciate the value and role of material science, engineering and manufacturing when
addressing international societal challenges. Students at the WMG Academy for Young Engineers will benefit from a
structured programme of learning (focussed on key STEM subjects), based around state-of-the-art facilities and real-world
problems. Information from the project will be disseminated on a WMG website. The website will facilitate a centralised
repository for relevant open source data and open source WMG publications.
Social
Reduced emissions from transport and the grid through energy storage, reduced reliance on rare earth materials (i.e.
lithium and graphite) that are required for battery manufacture and are highly sought after in related sectors (i.e. electrical
machines and renewable energy).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98560</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>99891</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Innovate UK</gtr:department><gtr:description>Scalable electrophoretic manufacture of high density 2-dimensional materials for energy storage applications (EL2D)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of the UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>72988-499318</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>97786003-F531-41F8-8205-55CE92618670</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>125000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Energy Storage Electrode Manufacturing (ELEMENT)</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/P026818</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>31E08AA6-7B9D-491B-8194-BC8AB1D57682</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project investigated the potential of electrode formulations using Graphene as a material for energy storage.
