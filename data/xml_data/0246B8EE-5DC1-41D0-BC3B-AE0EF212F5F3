Moreover, now that misfolding has been shown to be the source of a range of diseases, a knowledge of the factors that determine whether a polypeptide chain will fold to its native state or aggregate has become all the more important. While the field of protein folding generally is considered to be mature, much controversy still remains on many fundamental topics including the importance of residual structure in denatured states, the nature of folding steps and kinetic barriers as well the extent of pathway diversity. These questions can be analysed in a rigorous way by describing the folding dynamics as diffusion on a free energy landscape. However, in spite of their fundamental importance the quantitatively accurate free energy landscapes of proteins are yet to be determined. The state of the art experimental techniques lack the necessary spatial and temporal resolution. Properties of the landscapes can be probed only indirectly. 
 Simulation, in principle, can provide (infinitely) high spatial and temporal resolution, necessary for the construction of the quantitatively accurate free energy landscapes. Recently, due to advances in the hardware and simulation methodology realistic simulation of folding of small fast-folding proteins became computationally affordable. The current record holder is the simulation reported in the landmark paper by Shaw et al. The paper presents a ``brute-force'' 200 $\mu$s detailed all-atom equilibrium folding simulation of FIP35 protein in explicit water that contains 15 folding-unfolding events with the folding rate and the native structure in agreement with experiment. Many more simulations are now in progress. Which opens a new exciting era, when a detailed understanding of the controversial issues surrounding protein folding dynamics becomes possible. 
 The trajectories obtained in such simulations, which contain the detailed information about the folding dynamics, are many terabytes in size and generally present a big challenge for an automated analysis. Moreover, accurate quantitative analysis of protein folding dynamics in terms of free energy landscapes is notoriously difficult. Conventional approaches, even though being based on solid physical intuition, often lead to suboptimal results with simple free energy landscapes which hide the inherent complexity of folding dynamics. Such landscapes, in essence, through away the biggest advantage of the simulation - the wealth of detailed information. We will apply the newly developed rigorous approach to determine high-resolution quantitatively accurate free energy landscape for protein folding. Later the approach will be extended to determine such landscape based on trajectories recorded in single molecule experiments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The project aims to obtain better understanding of the controversial issues of protein folding such as the height of folding barriers and the value of the pre-exponential factor, the nature of folding steps, the diversity of folding pathways, and the importance of residual structure in the denatured state. It will be carried out by performing quantitatively accurate, high resolution free energy landscape analysis of protein folding dynamics. We will analyse realistic (equilibrium, all atom, explicit solvent, unbiased) protein folding simulations. Proteins from different structural classes will be considered: all-alpha, all-beta, and unstructured peptides. The optimal reaction coordinate, the associate free energy profiles and the diffusion coefficient will be determined by using cut-based free energy profiles. The accuracy and self-consistency of the description of will be monitored by inspecting whether the projected dynamics is diffusive. New types of reaction coordinate and optimization strategies will be explored. Extension of the approach to the analysis of single molecule experiments will be developed.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The academic community will be the main beneficiaries from this research, mainly through the new knowledge that we will obtain on protein folding dynamics and through new methodological developments of our approach.

In spite of their fundamental importance quantitatively accurate free energy landscapes for protein folding are yet to be determined. The project will determine such landscapes for a few proteins from structurally different classes. The landscapes will be used to interpret and suggest new experiments, to assess the quality of MD simulations, to test theoretical models for protein folding and to test different analysis approaches by providing state of the art results. Precise, detailed understanding about how proteins fold and unfolds are likely to be useful in developing research strategies to deal with diseases associated with misfolding and are of interest to researchers in medical community.

The methodological developments are likely to have significant impact on the broader scientific community because the problems of dimensionality reduction and simplified while accurate description of complex dynamics are common to many fields of science: data driven biology, machine learning and artificial intelligence, chemistry, economics, medicine, to name a few. In particular, for medicine, the approach has recently been applied to determine the optimal reaction coordinate, an optimal biomarker, which accurately describes the post operational dynamics of kidney transplantation. 

Results from the research are likely to have high impact and will be disseminated through publication in high impact journals. The University Press office, together with Campus PR will be used to communicate key research findings with high impact. We will make use of the University Enterprise and Innovation office to explore possible links to industry to exploit the applications of the developed approach.

The appealing feature of the free energy landscape framework and our approach is the ability to provide simple, intuitive and accurate description (picture) of many complex dynamical phenomena, for example, protein folding, the game of chess, economics. This ability will be explored to engage public in understanding the phenomena. A Wikipedia page devoted to the free energy landscapes, in general, and their application to protein folding, in particular, will be developed and maintained.

Finally, if successful, this research will train a postdoctoral researcher in a cutting edge and interdisciplinary research technique that will enable him to contribute more effectively to the wider economy in the future. To increase the participation of under-represented groups, we aim to recruit minority or female PDRA for the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>278862</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>How proteins fold is one of fundamental problems of biophysics. Widely differing opinions exist even for the fundamental issues and interpretation of many folding experiments Direct determination of many quantities from experiment is hampered by very limited spatial and temporal resolution of state of the art techniques. Atomistic simulations have practically unlimited spatial and temporal resolution and thus, in principle, should allow one to determine these quantities in a rigorous and direct manner. Here we used a state of the art analysis method to obtain a direct and rigorous estimate of the pre-exponential factor for a number of proteins.

Another fundamental finding is the development of a new non-parametric approach for reaction coordinate optimization. State of the art realistic simulations of complex atomic processes commonly produce trajectories of
large size, making the development of automated analysis tools very important. A popular approach
aimed at extracting dynamical information consists of projecting these trajectories into optimally
selected reaction coordinates or collective variables. To determine them, one selects a functional form
with many parameters and trains it on the trajectories using various criteria. A major problem with
such an approach is that a poor initial choice of the functional form may lead to sub-optimal results.
Here, we suggested an approach which allows one to optimize the reaction coordinate without selecting
its functional form and thus avoiding this source of error.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The value of the pre-exponential factor can be used for better analysis and interpretation of protein folding experiments and their quantitative comparison with atomistic simulations.

The new method for reaction coordinate optimization can be used for rigorous, quantitative analysis of various type of complex dynamics, e.g., atomistic simulation of protein folding, determining biomarkers for the description of disease dynamics.
