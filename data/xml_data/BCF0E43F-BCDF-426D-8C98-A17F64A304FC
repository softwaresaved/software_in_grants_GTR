Archive networks</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/P005918/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The current problems created by the diminishing funding of libraries and museums increasingly limit engagement with communities and inhibits collaborative partnerships. The problem is particularly acute in relation to the use and reuse of digital assets- both at an archival and community level- and this project seeks to provide one solution through the provision of the digital resources created as part of the AHRC funded Pararchive project (www.pararchive.com). Those resources have been branded as YARN (http://yarncommunity.com) and are now freely available. YARN provides a collaborative platform on which communities and public sector organisations can work together to help them establish effective digital community workspaces to deliver a range of co-designed impacts that respond to community needs and institutional aspirations. Thus the aim of this application is to work with a range of communities and public library and archive organisations to help them address a series of difficult self-identified issues relating to local history work, genealogy, co-working, publishing, working with disadvantaged and hard to reach audiences, and the use of 'hidden' or degraded digital resources. The project is based on the desire to build on the unintended consequences of our research and broaden community engagement. Follow-on funding would allow us to do this and act on a range of community requests, develop expanding networks and deliver broad social benefit. We are keen to work with new partners to further disseminate our digital platform and expand its application; to that end we have engaged in conversations with a range of providers about how they might use our resources and have sought to understand the nature of their ongoing problems and digital requirements to determine mutually reinforcing outcomes. Consequently, our focus will be on the development of impact through public networks to produce scalable strategies and demonstrate the value of our tools in a range of public facing contexts. 

We have been delighted by the responses to the prototype of YARN and the inclusion of the platform within a number of recently funded research projects and several ongoing applications that have developed in parallel with our own research. For example, YARN has been included on the recently successful Junction Arts HLF JA40 application for community history (http://junctionarts.org/2015/10/ja40/), as part of the AHRC funded Cultural Value Project Digital Tools in the Service of Difficult Heritage: How Recent Research Can Benefit Museums and their Audiences (http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/news/article/4365/new_ahrc-funded_project_digital_tools_in_the_service_of_difficult_heritage_how_recent_research_can_benefit_museums_and_their_audiences ) and the British Academy-funded Leeds Voices- Communicating Superdiversity project(http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/20045/leeds_humanities_research_institute/2718/leeds_voices_communicating_superdiversity). The follow-on funding would allow us to develop new collaborative partnerships that will ensure maximum benefits for users and allow them to achieve goals that they would not be in a position to realise for themselves. The four partnerships at the heart of the project allow us to co-develop new impacts directly related to pressing community and institutional need. We want our new partners and user communities to take ownership of the resource and shape it for use within their own contexts and allow them to produce scalable models and proof of concept for its application within their own spheres of practice and creative activity. We believe that this will both stimulate innovative practices and allow us to disseminate new approaches to collaborative working. We also want to facilitate inter-project mentoring and the sharing of best practice so that YARN can act as a means of building cross sector capacity and the basis for sharing impact potential amongst users.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will provide impact across a number of sectors and has been carefully designed in consultation with our four impact partners to maximise the effectiveness of our collaborative working. We have consulted closely with our partners to identify the key issues that YARN could help them with and have consequently built the four projects around those themes. At their core are the issues of digital workspaces, collaborative research, knowledge exchange, accessibility, inclusion and resource building.Through this process we have determined the most effective means of realising a defined set of aspirations for each group and broader networks of users and local authority service providers. The four projects provide these groups with clearly defined and mutually determined outcomes that are fully scaleable for other user communities and local authorities. Our key impact beneficiaries are:

1. Impact partners
Our four partners represent a range of library, archival and community organisations whose core role is to develop collaborative relationships with user communities. They variously provide access to a range of archival content, library resources and provide leadership and training for communities in the use of resources for eduction, local history, family research and leisure.They are concerned with how best to engage with users through digital interfaces and how they can develop audiences and resources within an increasingly difficult financial environment. YARN provides them with an open and cost free platform through which to run projects and work with local audiences and communities to develop new relationships, digital resources and co-create knowledge about their collections. It also allows them to focus on key target audiences such as hard to reach communities and those with intellectual disabilities.The specially designed projects will enable them to develop such relationships and embedded the resource within their digital offer.It will aid them in evaluating new technological approaches to audience development and provide training and support for their staff and resource networks. 

2. Public User groups 
Our public user groups will similarly benefit from access to the resource and training and support to enable them to develop autonomy in the use of the platform, allowing them to research, exchange knowledge, showcase expertise and participate in collaborative projects in open partnership with local authority and heritage providers. They will be able to use heritage materials free from copyright restrictions and have access to resources that have previously been denied or had become unavailable due to web degradation. It will allow for the development of new user communities built around a number of foci including local history, cultural interests, news stories, hobbies and creative practice. It will foster and encourage creative thinking, self-reflective storytelling, and broader social participation. We will be particularly focusing on often hard to reach or isolated user communities and will seek to identify potential future impact activities related related to these audiences- for example in terms of the educational or therapeutic potential of this resource.

3. Local authority, archive and heritage professionals
These projects and the associated training materials will be of broader interest to these professionals and a key aim of these activities is to offer mentorship and scalability to new user and professional communities and to rollout the resource through our partner networks and professional organisations. YARN will provide an ongoing and developing series of resources and a focus for reporting the progress of projects. It will also provide access to new bodies of archival content for public and professional use to allow us to disseminate best practice and encourage project-based conversations and mentorship opportunities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80639</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P005918/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9DD86EE2-EE6B-432E-AEE0-0C8669A1CBB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library &amp; information studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C96AF50D-AD7C-4C61-A30E-B8619DB33BAA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archives</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0A982A4A-12CF-4734-AFCA-A5DC61F667F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Information &amp; Knowledge Mgmt</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2968C870-0FF4-4AE9-A670-9B0161C83B37</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>New Media/Web-Based Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
