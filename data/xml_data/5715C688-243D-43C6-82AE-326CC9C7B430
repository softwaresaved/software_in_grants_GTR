At the same time, there is evidence of increasing bidialectalism, where speakers have two ways of speaking: a local dialect and a more formal, standard way, as the example below shows: &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shona: I na ken far the quines is.&lt;br /> Jennifer: Sorry?&lt;br /> Shona: I said I don?t know where the girls are. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But what exactly does it mean to be bidialectal? Can speakers really have control over two dialects, just as, for example, a bilingual speaker has over two languages? And what are the implications of bidialectalism for the future of local dialects? To answer these questions, the project will investigate the speech of 10 to 80 year olds in a small Scottish community. The speakers will be recorded once with someone from the local community (an ?insider?) and once with someone from southern England (an ?outsider?). This will allow us to test the limits of bidialectalism by investigating who switches where and when. The results will provide a snapshot of bidialectalism in the 21st century and how this might affect the future dialect landscape of the British Isles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
The research will benefit educational policy makers, teachers, pupils and the general public. 

How will they benefit?
Benefits will accrue from educational policies on language in the classroom being based on a scientific analysis of local dialect use in tandem with the standard variety. 

Despite nearly 60 years of sociolinguistic research which show that local varieties are rule-governed just as standard English is, stereotypes about these dialects persist today, and are used in the formation of educational policy and practice. Discrimination arises from the fact that policy makers and teachers may not know which features are part of the child's local dialect or simply 'mistakes' which need to be eradicated from speech and/or writing. The speakers themselves may also not know that forms they use are part of rule-governed variation in their speech, not random mistakes. 

This lack of knowledge may have far-reaching effects on speakers of vernacular dialects in the school context. The Department for Education's National Curriculum for English (Key stages 1-4, 11-16 years old, https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/QCA-99-459.pdf) states that 'English can play a part in promoting citizenship and thinking skills through...becoming competent users of spoken and written standard English to enable pupils to participate fully in the wider world beyond school, in public life, and in decision making'. This has direct implications for children who speak a nonstandard dialect: it suggests that they are unlikely be able to fully participate in public life without full competence in standard English. Thus they are at an educational disadvantage from the start.

This prejudice may also affect the teaching staff, as reported in a number of newspapers in October 2010: Offsted had criticized a number of teaching assistants for their 'heavy local accents and grammatical inaccuracy...which were setting a bad example to pupils (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8039833/Teaching-staff-rapped-over-use-of-local-dialect.html).

In Scotland, there is a different policy: teachers are encouraged to help students to become competent in Standard English while at the same time facilitating the retention of their indigenous dialect. This is demonstrated in the Scottish Parliament's ongoing debates on the implementation of Scots in the curriculum (http://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/view/1301) and the General Teaching Council for Scotland's Professional Recognition Award for the teaching of Scots (http://www.gtcs.org.uk/news-events/news/scots-language-teaching-recognised.aspx). Although these intentions are good, the dialect materials used often represent an older form of the vernacular, with words and phrases which are alien to 21st century teacher and pupil. 

The results from this research can provide teachers and policy makers with information on the dialect forms used in present day and whether pupils are aware of, and can use, the standard equivalent in speech and writing. This, in turn, can have fundamental implications for how a pupil is assessed in the classroom context and following, their success or failure to 'participate fully in the wider world beyond school' in later life. 

It can also impact on community level initiatives through exchange with the excellent local dialect group which exists in the community. Within this dialect group and more generally, the perception exists that young speakers no longer use dialect forms. This research can inform on which features are indeed still in use, which may be changing and how the dialect group and community more widely may wish to respond to these results at the grass roots level.

However, statements on bidialectalism remain largely observational: we have little empirical information on if, how and when speakers have access to two or more varieties of a language. In this research we provide an analysis of bidialectalism in a small community in north east Scotland, Buckie, which aims to shed light on the sociolinguistic details of this phenomenon. 

In this project we tested the sociolinguistic details of bidialectalism by recording speakers from Buckie first with a with a community insider and second with a community outsider. This allowed us to test whether indeed speakers can switch fluently between dialect and more standard forms according to whom they were in conversation with. We recorded 63 speakers across 4 different generations and have conducted a number of quantitative analyses of different linguistic features. Our findings to date show that speakers can switch with words and sounds, but not with grammar. We suggest that this is due to salience of particular linguistic forms: a speaker only switches from dialect to standard if s/he knows in the first place that there is a difference. These findings have far reaching implications for the structure of language as revealed through the analysis of the bidialectal speaker. 

The most significant achievements from the grant were:
1. archival: we created a fully searchable text to sound aligned corpus of over one million words of naturally occurring speech 
2. analytical: to date we have conducted quantitative analyses of 31 linguistic variables across all levels of speech - words, sounds, grammar, discourse. This provides the most comprehensive view of bidialectalism conducted to date. 
3. technical: in addition to manual phonetic analysis, we created automatic acoustic measurements of vowels across a subset of the data (24 speakers in total). This results in larger, faster, more sophisticated analyses of speech data across phonetic forms. 
4. unique corpora: as part of larger project, we tracked 14 preschool children from a previous ESRC funded project now in preadolescence. This is one of the very few 'real time' corpora of speech which exist in tracking the emergence of sociolinguistic norms. 
5. publication: we have two papers accepted for publication in high level journals and are currently preparing a full manuscript which brings together the rich findings from this project. 
6. contribution to linguistic research: the results shed light on the architecture of the linguistic system in dealing with two varieties of one language. Our results suggest that bidialectalism is very different to bilingualism, despite the implied similarities in the naming practices. These findings will be of interest to linguistics, educators, sociologists and psychologists.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Non-academic: one of the aims of the Curriculum for Excellence in Scotland is to develop the study of the Scots language.
