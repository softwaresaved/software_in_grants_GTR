One critical way governments can support entrepreneurs is helping them to be more successful in acquiring financial resources needed to initiate or expand their venture.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project draws on the communication perspective on entrepreneurship and suggests that by using certain forms language and body language entrepreneurs can be more effective in interactions with potential stakeholders. If these behaviours can be identified, they can be assessed and developed in others helping to improve rates of success in gaining external funding.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thirty technology entrepreneurs will be identified to take part in the project. Over the period of the project three studies will be conducted:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Study 1 (linguistic analysis of videotaped pitches to investors) will develop insights into the form, frequency and function of language and body language used by entrepreneurs.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Study 2 (an in-depth visual ethnographic study)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Study 3 (an experimental study) will provide information on whether these tactics have an impact on investor's decisions.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic users of this research will include government policy-makers, bodies which implement government policy (e.g. BIS), entrepreneurship educators (e.g. Connect Networks), support networks for entrepreneurs (e.g. Business Link), practitioners who work with entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs themselves. Governments are increasingly seeking to develop and implement policies which are instrumental in developing entrepreneurial activity given the important role it plays in the economy. If the communication skills of entrepreneurs are viewed as central to the achievement of funding, as opposed to an innate personality trait or aligning with institutional norms, it follows that these behaviours can be identified, assessed and developed in others. Current advice for entrepreneurs focuses on what should be &amp;quot;said&amp;quot; (i.e. the content of pitches) but there are few practical insights on how entrepreneurs can be most effective in communication with investors. The research will provide the knowledge, understanding and materials for those interested in entrepreneurship education and development to support entrepreneurs in becoming more successful in acquiring financial resources to initiate or expand their ventures. 

The research will be closely managed so as to ensure successful communication and engagement. First the PI will develop a project website to promote and disseminate the project (accessed through the c-TIE website). A press agency will be also be engaged to assist the PI with disseminating findings to the public (e.g. through press releases). The PI will also work alongside Connect Yorkshire (who have been involved in designing this research project) to develop state-of-the-art training materials based on the results of this research. These materials will form the basis of Connect Yorkshire's training in how to pitch effectively to investors at their pre-investment workshops. Following the successful implementation of these training materials within Yorkshire they will be disseminated to the wider Connect Networks throughout the UK. The training materials will also been used within the Leeds Enterprise Centre and the International Corporate Leadership Programme at Leeds University. In addition, with the support of Professor Paul Hannon (acting CEO of NCGE), these training materials will be disseminated to those training graduate entrepreneurs within the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship training of entrepreneurs. They will also be posted on Start-Up Britain as the PI acts as a local ambassador for this organisation.

The PI will also leverage her own network and that of her on-site mentor Prof Richard Thorpe to ensure that the project has an impact at the policy-making/implementation level. Existing networks include contacts in The Regional Development Agency and the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). The PI will collect data from the Connect Networks to assess whether they are more successful in helping entrepreneurs secure finance following their adoption of the training materials developed by the PI. This will add further weight to the PIs discussions with policy-making bodies. The PI's impact agenda will be supported by a well thought through training plan which will develop her knowledge exchange skills. She will also be supported by her on-site mentor Prof Richard Thorpe who has an extensive practitioner network and established relationships with policy-making bodies. The project will also benefit from the PI's membership of the inter-disciplinary c-TIE group in LUBS which has a special interest in technology ventures and is currently working on the commercialisation of regenerative therapies and devices in collaboration with the Faculties of Medicine and Engineering. Given the PI's focus on funding for novel technology ventures this connection offers ideal future opportunities for technology companies to benefit from the PI's research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>171726</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview with the Financial Times Business Education online video</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3147F3D7-87AD-4A4A-A2C7-558DCF464FAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The PI was video interviewed on the results of the research project by Della Bradshaw from the Financial Times Business Education Section in their London studies.

Four organisations have been instrumental in allowing us access to their events, and they continue to engage with this project by sharing details about the next stage of the project (an online-questionnaire based on an acted-out business pitch) with their networks. A wide range of further contacts made at the pitching events we recorded have expressed interest in our findings, including entrepreneurs, business consultants, and public speaking consultants. 

We have collected a large data set, consisting of 55 business pitches ranging in duration from 3 minutes to almost 40 minutes. The majority of the entrepreneurs filmed agreed to their recording being submitted to a data archive for future use. The pitches were filmed in high definition and so are suitable for future research on the non-verbal behaviour exhibited by entrepreneurs when they present their ventures, in addition to the verbal.

The use of naturally-occurring interactional data (in this case real-life pitches that would have occurred whether or not we recorded them) in research on entrepreneurial communication is relatively novel, as is a focus on the non-verbal and gestural behaviour exhibited. Early findings from the study have been shared with colleagues from other Business Schools in the UK at a workshop on 'Analysing business as it happens using observational data', where we presented on using our data of naturally-occurring pitches to examine how entrepreneurs communicate their ideas to potential investors. We have also described our methodological approach using visual data in a paper submitted for a special issue of Organizational Research Methods.

Foci of our on-going analyses include the use of talk related to emotion in business pitches, how entrepreneurs justify their ventures as a whole and the claims that they make in their pitches, and how they position themselves as closer or further from their audience when referencing knowledge that they may or may not share.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The overall findings will be of use to entrepreneurs preparing to pitch for financial backing, and to the business angel organisations that organise pitching events and help to prepare entrepreneurs for these events. The findings will be made available in a report that will be shared with the contacts made throughout the data collection process, and in training materials to be shared with organisations who support entrepreneurs and organise pitching events.

The findings will also make a contribution to entrepreneur and organisation studies. The visual methodology can be applied to future studies of business interactions, and the kinds of practices we describe that entrepreneurs use when trying to persuade their audience to invest with them illustrate what is deemed to be of importance - both by entrepreneurs and investors - when pitching to potential investors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BA20F02D-3059-4C6F-A0B9-C2BD815F1EB2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training materials for entrepreneurial pitches/Training workshops for investment networks on non-verbals in pitch presentation.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9D29FC50-6907-4D7E-87A7-8C2705889799</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>For this project we have collected 55 individual business pitches from across the UK.

As we are interested in just how it is that entrepreneurs communicate their venture to potential investors, we are focusing on their talk at a great level of detail. This is something that the methodology of conversation analysis fits very well with, as it looks at exactly how speakers achieve the things that they do through their talk. Although conversation analysis was first developed approximately 50 years ago, it has not been used in entrepreneurship studies, and so this project brings this methodology into a new area. We are also interested in the non-verbal and gestural behaviour of the presenters when they pitch, again something that has not received much attention in this field. The project, then also provides an example of how this element of interaction can be examined in the area of entrepreneurship, drawing on the analytical tools of gesture studies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FBAEE8C2-CDCF-4AEE-8070-EB8F9C69CC24</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Based on this work, visual approaches are beginning to make an impact into research in entrepreneurship.
