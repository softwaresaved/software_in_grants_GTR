&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>create a climate of collaboration between research, policy making&amp;nbsp; and practice through delivering a series of seminars&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>disseminate new and existing research through an online resource&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>develop international comparative analysis by inviting key researchers to share knowledge&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>contribute to the development of practice, by identifying professional development and training needs&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>inform policy by engaging a wider arena than normally covered by arts networks&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>maximise the impact of the network through collaboration or partnership with think tanks and NGOs.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This will be achieved through collation and dissemination of existing and new research.&amp;nbsp; It will involve desk research to identify existing research studies, as well as open calls to network members and relevant research centres to contribute new research findings.&amp;nbsp; Findings will be disseminated widely, both through the series of seminars and through the online resources. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal builds on the successes of a regional knowledge exchange network, which has already had significant impact in terms of connecting academics, policy makers and practitioners in the North of England. Membership currently includes 
- over a dozen universities, 
- local authority and Arts Council officers, 
- individual artists and representatives from large scale arts organizations, 

This model will be built on nationally to ensure that the impact is felt far beyond academia. In particular impact will be achieved in the following ways
- Engaging practitioners in areas of low engagement. This will be achieved through linking up with local authority and locally based networks to target people to attend seminars who do not normally engage with academia, 
- Ensuring knowledge exchange has a legacy locally. This will be achieved by ensuring maximum buy in from local communities by co-producing events with partners in the different locations
- Facilitating virtual debate between seminars via an online resource and blog. This will be achieved through promoting the network through other networks and social media

The project will impact on policy makers, by 
1) providing opportunites for knowledge exchange across policy areas through physical and virtual networking
2) sharing knowledge on initiatives in the cultural field which mobilise wider participation by developing and diseminating research through seminars, conferences, publication and online resource 
2) encouraging greater understanding across sectors by engineering encounters and exchanges between pubic policy makers, academics and practitioners 
3) generating a more detailed understanding of geographical areas characterised by low levels of participation, by working in collaboration with areas of social deprivation funded to develop participation and engagement through the Arts Council's Creative People and Places initiative. 

The project will impact on the academic community by
1) providing an opportunity to engage with interdisciplinary work through access to research through seminars, conferences, publication and on line resources
2) widening perspectives and contacts with a view to initaiting new research through networking with policy makers and practitioners through seminars in UK and overseas
3) offering opportunities to present new research findings at seminars, conferences, publication and onlne resource
4) providing opportunties for creative discussion at seminars and conferences 

The project will impact on practitioners by
1) improve understanding of public policy priorities thus contributing to the possibility of gaining greater financial sustainability by providing networking and training opportunites
2) providing an invaluable opportunity for reflection and contextualisation of practice by sharing knowledge and supporting case study research on practice

The project will impact on the general public by 
1) training in good practice and thereby enhancing the effectiveness of engagement workers in neighbourhood planning, health services, youth and community development projects and grassroots arts initiatives; 
2) creating templates to improve the methodology for soliciting and gathering creative ideas from people about public services in any field and creating a better model for public engagement 
3) sharing research that helps develop broader understanding on how to deal with the problem of involving marginalised groups in public life, especially in areas of social and economic deprivation</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15766</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Key note to Take Part Network in Denmark</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0FD2C7C6-6391-436C-96B9-5152364D08D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I provided a provocation to about 50 people, including academics and practitioners, at the launch of a new network on participation in Denmark</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://projekter.au.dk/en/take-part/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Arts, Craft &amp; Rural Participation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9FDBA84A-0EB1-4395-8623-80449045EB1A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the 4 of our seminar series and 37 people examining engagement in rural settings and the importance of the crafts.

In addition we have had an impact on knowledge exchange between practitioners, academics and policy makers through the programming of seminars to include speakers from each of the target groups. All these activities have also stimulated requests for further information and future activity 

This has resulted in spin offs including a CPD programme to further support skills development, with 4 accredited short courses at masters level; an international conference for sharing knowledge and stimulating thinking through international comparative research, which involved 150 academics and practitioners and presented 30 papers. This will have wider impact with the publication of a special edition journal later this year. In addition the PI has had 2 journal articles published giving wider academic impact to the work. The PI and CI have also been invited internationally to do key note presentations related to the work and been interviewed in the press.

The programme has had an impact on society by working with Creative People and Places in areas of low engagement/investment in arts and academia to build the capacity of local people through engagement in a seminar programme. An additional seminar was also delivered for the general public to encourage public engagement in the issues raised.

This had the spin off of, resulting in one collaborative research programme in Doncaster, generating an additional &amp;pound;35000 research income and influencing policy making through being invited to sit on the national steering committee for the &amp;pound;37 million Creative People and Places fund.

A funding bid for further research has been submitted to AHRC, which was unfortunately unsuccessful. 
As a further impact of the funding we were invited to host a national conference for Arts Council England, titled PEOPLE, PLACE, POWER which took place in September 2016.

The PI was also invited to Denmark in summer 2016 to advise the evaluation team of AARHUS 2017 Capital of Culture and has since given 2 key note speeches in the country and written a report for the Aarhus 2017 European Capital of Culture team. This research is influencing practitioners in Denmark</gtr:description><gtr:id>AB600F9F-22AE-41FA-9743-D0A5D974C9C6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) The grant has developed a climate of collaboration between academia and practice, across different public policy areas by creating a knowledge exchange network of over 500 members: approximately 50 policy makers, 100 academics, 200 arts practitioners and 150 other members from different sectors, ranging from the NHS, local authority commissioners, the voluntary sector and others
2) the network has disseminated new research to a wider audience, contributing to the development of practice in industry, by delivering a seminar series on a range of issues relating to issues of increasing participation. These have taken place in areas identified as having low levels of engagement in government surveys. All were developed in partnership with other public sector organisations. In total 220 people attended and over 20 papers were presented. Presentations and related literature were also made available online (http://www.participationandengagement-arts.co.uk/previous-events-and-seminars) but in summary these were as follows

Participatory Decision Making - The Point, Doncaster
39 attendees, and co-hosted with Doncaster Creative People and Places. (www.thepoint.org.uk/article/right-up-our-street) who are investigating models of participatory decision making. 

Arts Participation and the Health &amp;amp; Well-being Agenda - Northern Stage, Newcastle
57 people attendees and co-hosted by Ashington Creative People and Places (http://www.experiencewoodhorn.com/creative-people-and-places/), who are working across the arts and health sectors to research models to increase well being through participation in the arts. This achieved the aim of connecting the arts sector and NHS and contributing to practice.

Arts Participation, Volunteering &amp;amp; The Big Society, Blackpool Grand Theatre
47 people attended and co-hosted with Blackpool Creative People and Places, (http://www.blackpool.gov.uk/Residents/Libraries-arts-and-heritage/Arts/Creative-People-and-Places.aspx) who are examining how capacity building and volunteering can improve the sustainability of the arts in Blackpool. This achieved the aim of connecting the arts and voluntary sectors and contributing to practice.

Arts, Craft &amp;amp; Rural Participation, Spalding College
37 people attended and co-hosted by Boston and South Holland Creative People and Places (http://www.transportedart.com/ ) who are examining engagement in rural settings and the importance of the crafts. This achieved the aim of bringing together people working in arts and crafts and contributing to practice.

Ask the audience - The Arts Funding Debate, The Carriageworks, Leeds
100 attendees and co-hosted with The Culture Vulture (http://theculturevulture.co.uk) this was the first event we opened to the general public. This interactive session, including a question time panel, explored the case for different funding choices in the arts. The debate was followed by a public vote using an interactive board game, especially designed for the event. Similar sessions are planned as a legacy of the programme in other locations. This session achieved the aim of engaging the general public in academic discourse and contributing to practice.

Co-production &amp;amp; co-design in the arts and in public services, Royal Society for the Arts, London
This seminar was co-hosted with Involve (http://www.involve.org.uk/) and Royal Society for the Arts (http://www.thersa.org/ ). It provided those working in the arts the opportunity to engage with debates and practices in other areas of the public sector. It also offered those working in other areas the chance to explore how cultural activity may help them deliver other objectives. This session achieved the aim of engaging the arts sector with broader debates about civic participation and democracy and contributing to practice.

3) achieved the aim of disseminating new research more widely and creating the climate of collaboration by developing an online resource to disseminate research in this area (www.participationandengagement-arts.co.uk). This houses presentations from seminars, blog discussions between seminars and approximately 100 links to research reports. Mapping of website users began in October 2013. Since then it has received nearly 4000 hits, with people viewing information on sessions and downloading research documents. In addition we now have an active twitter feed @artsken to direct traffic to the website and promote activities. This has over 400 followers and retweets have an average reach of 10,000 per month. 
4) Developing links between academia and practice by developing and accrediting a CPD programme consisting of the following four modules:
- Participatory Decision Making
- Culture-Based Local Development; 
- Planning and Evaluation; 
- International Perspectives on Cultural Participation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As demonstrated above the network of 500 members has had significant impact; connecting academics, policy makers and practitioners across England, with growing interest from overseas, demonstrated by our invitation to host an international conference in Holland as a wider impact of the programme.

The opportunity to engage with people from different sectors and disciplines, has both advanced understanding and provided opportunities for collaborations in new research and provided an outlet for this research to be disseminated to a wider audience beyond academia.

By working across disciplines it has increased knowledge and understanding among arts academics and practitioners about other policy areas, such as health and well being, social equity and diversity, as well as introduced those from other sectors to how the arts may address their issues.

The inclusion of policy makers within the network supports wider social and policy impacts, demonstrated by the invitation for the PI to sit on the national steering committee for Creative People and Places and become an Arts Council Assessor. Links with Involve, Royal Society for the Arts and the NHS have also been developed through the programme.

The international conference which was delivered as a longer term impact of the funding attracted 150 delegates and 30 papers were presented.
