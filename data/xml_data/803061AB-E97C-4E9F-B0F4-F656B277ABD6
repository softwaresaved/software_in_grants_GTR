Solving the problem of cleaning clothes in cold water is such an opportunity. This project offers the chance to travel inside a familiar every-day activity and actually see the physical processes that take place inside dirty clothes as they are washed. Chemical process are of course relevant, but the physical processes are in many ways the DNA of the cleaning process, giving structure &amp;amp; function to everything else that takes place. The challenge is to develop a fully mechanistic understanding of the physical processes that pertain to the task of washing garments clean in cold water. While chemical processes are undoubtedly of great importance, the absence of appreciable thermal energy in a cold-water environment puts much greater emphasis on the role of mechanical energy. It is this fact that makes the daily chore of washing clothes in cold water such a burden for so many people in developing countries in terms of time and effort. There is an urgent need to optimize the cleaning effect of the available mechanical energy (and better still, to reduce the total amount required) in order to deliver considerable benefits to the approximately 3 billion people whose clothes still have to be washed by hand, and also to lower the amount of electricity that is consumed of those who wash by machine.The idea of this project is to separate the mechanical cleaning process into key sets of interactions concerning soil, fabric and fluid while considering all relevant scales. Over this range, we will determine the magnitude of the forces that bind soil material together in particles, cause soil particles to adhere to fabric fibres, deform fabric weaves in the presence of fluid flows, and that are required during the process of garment washing. The approach will be to make precise measurements of these forces in test soils &amp;amp; fabrics under controlled laboratory conditions, develop theoretical models of the relevant physical processes based on the experimental data, and ultimately to manufacture &amp;amp; test prototype washing simulators that incorporate the knowledge gained from the measurement &amp;amp; modelling work. These ideas have the potential to transform the ways that washing processes are evaluated and that new cleaning products are tested prior to implementation. The novelty of the project derives in part from the multi-scale approach of the investigation and also from the objective of measuring &amp;amp; visualizing mechanical cleaning action under controlled reproducible conditions. The adventure of the project comes from the breadth of the problem being tackled and from the depth of physical insight that is being sought.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>177948</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>57000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Unilever UK R&amp;D Centre Port Sunlight</gtr:department><gtr:description>Industrial funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Unilever</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>23B55AF4-5039-425B-8578-0BDBCCDC143A</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings have influenced a subsequent industrial collaborative PhD project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EC76FE30-0623-4138-919A-F65F5C06109E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Clothes washing is a common operation with an estimated 300 billion washings annually. Whilst washing machine design has become increasingly sophisticated in the Western World, for the majority of the world's population hand-washing remains the norm. Washing clothes by hand is scientifically poorly understood currently. A critical difference between machine and hand washing is that the temperature of the cleaning solution used for hand washing is usually ambient - and is thus lower than that commonly used in machine washing. This project aimed to separate the effects of chemical, hydraulic and mechanical action upon cleaning by constructing apparatus and protocols to examine the process scientifically.



The movements and manipulations used in hand-washing of fabrics were simulated using bespoke apparatus designed and constructed at the University of Bath: 



Apparatus No. 1 applied a controlled cyclical load to fabrics (clean or soiled) in a tank of water / cleaning agent, to investigate the effect of stretching,



Apparatus No. 2 rubbed the clean or soiled fabric over edges of controlled geometries, in a tank of water or cleaning agent.



Apparatus No. 3 consisted of a flow chamber, accommodating virgin, soiled or manipulated samples (outputs from rigs 1 &amp;amp; 2) and passed water or aqueous cleaning formulations across or thorough the cloth samples at controlled flow rates, sample and trans-fabric pressure drops, temperatures and times. 



The removal of a deposition mass of 8.55 +/- 0.43 mg.cm-2 of lard from plain-weave cotton fabrics was examined under controlled flow conditions using water and a non-ionic surfactant solurion. Three distinct flow regimes of cross-flow, through-flow and a 2:1 combination of cross- and through-flow respectively have been studied at three cleaning agent temperatures of 10 C, 25C and 40 C. The lard removal efficiency has been quantified by weighing and image analysis methods to determine the mass / unit area of lard in the treated region. The hydrodynamic resistance changes of the fouled samples have been monitored during the washing process. CFD simulations have been used to investigate the shear rate distribution on the yarn surface during the flow conditions selected (carried out by our collaborators at the University of Dundee). 



Results demonstrate that effective removal of lard from fabrics at low temperatures requires a combination of chemical, physical and hydraulic factors as hydrodynamic flow alone is insufficient to ensure complete removal. Trends in hydraulic resistance changes due to fabric swelling during cleaning have also been determined. The effect of hydraulic flow conditions upon the removal of lard from cotton samples at 10 ?C, 25?C &amp;amp; 40 ?C has been studied using a range of different hydrodynamic conditions using both pure water and non-ionic surfactant solutions. No significant removal of lard could be achieved at 10 ?C for the range of flow velocity and surfactant concentration tested. At 25?C, lard removal was poor, with removal masses of &amp;lt;30wt% being achieved for surfactant concentrations up to 0.25 g L-1. However at a temperature of 40 ?C, ca 40 - 60% of the lard had been removed within the flow area. However, within the range tested, the removal mass was not a strong function of either the flow conditions or the surfactant concentrations evaluated. A slight increase in removal mass (ca 5 10%), was seen when fluid flow was directed through the fabric as compared to cross-flow or combined flow regimes. This outcome was suggested by the numerical modelling carried out in Dundee University, which indicated very high rates of surface shear within the cloth pore for through-flow.



The relative hydrodynamic resistance of clean and fouled cloth can vary greatly with temperature. In non-uniformly fouled samples (such as those found during typical laundry washing), this would favour flow either through the clean cloth at cold temperatures, or through the fouled areas at high temperatures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Developing new:
