Rapidly routinised and normalised, IVF is now the platform technology of a global fertility industry linked not only to a wide range of clinical applications but to the horizon research fields of stem cell science, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. A stem technique for the 'age of biological control', IVF is also a very personal intervention, intimately interwoven into kinship and family life. It is thus a unique technology offering a distinctive historical case of translational science.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Through a series of three seminars over a two-year time period, the Department of Sociology at the University of Cambridge, in partnership with Christ's College, will host an extended interdisciplinary discussion of 'IVF Cultures and Histories' focussing on the interrelation of three main themes:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>its technological development and visual emergence as an iconic twentieth century technology&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the interface between IVF and the media (particularly in its crucial transition stage from experimental technique into clinical practice, 1970-80)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>its role as an 'ethical crucible' through which a new 'social contract' was forged between innovative research science and public morality in the late-twentieth century.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The term 'impact' is almost inseparable from the expression 'technological advances', and yet it is often very unclear what 'impact' means in the context of technology, where impact is ubiquitously presumed to exist, but rarely specified for the very reason that it is imagined to be synonymous with the 'arrival' of technology itself. In his influential study of television, for example, Raymond Williams (1990) argues that technology is one of the most poorly understood phenomena in all of social science. The main impact of the proposed seminar series, then, will be found in the attempt to define in more precise empirical and theoretical terms what 'impact' consists of by using IVF as an 'impact study' of sorts. IVF is undoubtedly one of the most 'impactful' technologies of the twentieth century. Yet, as argued in a recent article exploring the decision of the MRC not to fund Edwards' and Steptoes' research into human conception in the 1970s (Johnson, Franklin, et al 2010), IVF was not seen either to be likely to have the 'right' kind of impact, nor, indeed, to necessarily be likely to succeed at all. This picture is complicated by the increasing emphasis on translation in fields such as stem cell research and regenerative medicine -- arguably two of the most important technological offspring of IVF. In the midst of ongoing, and often fervent, debate about the future of these technologies, the role of public funding for them, their regulation, and the role of patient participation in them, the social history of IVF takes on an important role as a case study that may yield important insights into 'impact' -- notoriously an effect that can only be identified (a bit like pregnancy perhaps) in retrospect. In a sense, the entire proposed series is a re-evaluation of what is meant by the 'impact' of new technology, and careful consideration of this specific point will comprise a primary component of the final report, and of subsequent publications specifically focussed on the impact question. The social history of IVF is an ideal topic for this purpose, for reasons that exceed the space available here to explore, but which include the interesting effect that what is often most 'revolutionary' about new technologies, such as the iPad, is how quickly they become ordinary. This is an important part of the social history of IVF, and, ironically, one of the reasons IVF has played a lesser role in the social study of bioscience and biomedicine, which, until relatively recently, was dominated by the study of new genetic, rather than new reproductive, technologies. If it is the case that the social study of biomedicine currently represents one of the largest areas of growth in the social sciences in the UK, the question of what this field can contribute to impact studies is paramount. As we all know, there is considerable demand at present within government (e.g. David Willett's office) and the civil service (especially those who aid in research funding decisions) for 'impact stories' -- and these will comprise an important part of the forthcoming REF evaluation exercise. The proposed seminar series on IVF histories is ideally positioned as a context in which the meaning of impact can be productively explored in the midst of a general discussion about what this term means, and how to demonstrate 'impact'. The findings from this exercise will in turn provide an important basis for contributing to the discussion of all aspects of impact -- from where to find it and how to identify it, to the factors that limit or enhance impact. An obvious, but often overlooked, point is that not all 'impacts' are desirable. Indeed, 'impact' is arguable never a singular or unified phenomena. The social history of IVF comprises a valuable means of widening the 'impact dialogue' in ways that are both productive of better 'impact insights' and critical of 'impact myopia'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30327</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Some very practical outcomes of our workshop were archival. We assisted the family of Robert Edwards to prepare deposit documents for Bob's collections of slides, papers, and correspondence, and we moved these materials into the Churchill College Archive at Cambridge where they now comprise a valuable public resource. Similarly, with help from my research team, I arranged to make a complete digital copy of Bob's slide collections -- which were the focus of our first workshop, attended by several members of his family. We have since acquired another grant, a Wellcome Trust Provision for Public Engagement Award, one section of which is enabling the British photo-artist Gina Glover to work with some of Bob's images to make new artworks for display at Bourn Hall in Cambridge. In our second workshop, focussed specifically on the Oldham years, we were able to include several former patients and labworkers from the Oldham General Infirmary, including Grace MacDonald, John Webster and Noni Fallows. These individuals brought with them archival material which we have since incorporated into our published work, in a special issue of the journal Reproductive Biomedicine and Society, which launched with a Special Issue on The Oldham Period. Since then we have also completed formal interviews with several of the ESRC seminar participants for a new set of oral history interviews that are in preparation for intended deposit to the British Library. Again, these resources documenting he early years of UK IVF comprise a valuable public resource, to scholars and the general public alike. Since the seminars ended, we have begun to work with Louise Brown, whose autobiography was published just as our seminars ended, in the summer of 2015. Louise also has a large personal archive and one possible further output of our work will be the possibility of seeking funding to help catalogue and deposit this archive in Bristol. In our second workshop, we invited the filmmaker Peter Brown to show his 1978 documentary on the birth of Louise brown, and we have since also interviewed Peter about this important film and its reception. Our third workshop focussed on 'Time Lines and Time Lapses' and linked our work on the history of IVF to the future of its development, in particular through the new technology or morphokinetic embryo imaging (time-lapse embryo photography). This controversial new technology is also a symbol of how much IVF continues to serve as a 'looking glass' into our image of ourselves. Scientists we invited from world-leading Cambridge labs to share some of heir time-lapse imagery with us has let to important new collaborative links between the IVF Histories and Cultures projects and Cambridge labs. Together, we recently won a highly competitive award to make a short film called 'Dish Life', exploring the lives of cells and cell scientists in the lab. It will premiere this autumn in Cambridge.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7B705EBF-C116-4064-A288-75201F096D84</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This seminar series reconsidered the early history of UK IVF, exploring its significance as a translational technology, and seeking to understand the reasons for its emergence out of the scientific culture of British mammalian developmental biology and genetics in the mid-twentieth century. As an experiment in interdisciplinary dialogue, we brought together a wide range of participants over 3 day-long workshops. Our findings were both factual and methodological. We found that there had been many more attempts at IVF before it succeeded than had been previously thought. We also found the role of patients and medical staff -- in what could be described as a unique culture of voluntarism -- was a major contributor to the eventual success of IVF. We found that this early culture of IVF contrasted with the highly commercial and increasingly less public-spirited culture of IVF post 1978. We also found that IVF was funded by an anonymous American donor, who recently died, and we discovered new archival material belonging to Robert Edwards.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Broadly, our research contributes to the sociology of biomedical translation: we have identified and helped to document and characterise many of the social forces at work in the emergence of new technology. Methodologically, we used our seminars to create a parallel translational universe, through which we explored the emergence of IVF technology using interdisciplinary dialogue to explore this translational history. Our work thus serves as a model for both ethics and policy, as well as sociology and history, in the context of regulating new technologies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>53CF033B-E99B-404C-A220-E0C4883E4757</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.rbmsociety.com/article/S2405-6618(15)00002-7/abstract</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CDCCB2CD-FD3B-4DA7-B2D6-9BAE1096431A"><gtr:id>CDCCB2CD-FD3B-4DA7-B2D6-9BAE1096431A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Analogic Return: The Reproductive Life of Conceptuality</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theory, Culture &amp;
