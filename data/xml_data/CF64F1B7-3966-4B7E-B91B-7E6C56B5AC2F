These concerns have been expressed most strongly in the UK. The gap filled by the loss of religious and spiritual meanings may not have been adequately filled by secular alternatives. \n\nThe former states of Eastern Europe provide interesting test cases for the equivalence of religious and secular ideologies. The communist regimes set up at the end of WWII attempted to subvert religious culture into a socialist one with varying degrees of success. Bulgaria and Romania are examples of neighbouring countries with similar recent histories, but contrasting religiosity. A marked and persisting decline in religious practice took place in Bulgaria but not in Romania. The memories of those older people who lived through the period of communist power and its dissolution provide potentially important evidence on the perceived equivalence of the socialist and civic ceremonies designed to replace religious ritual at key points of life. \n\nIn this proposal we intend to interview 20 older people from each country, carefully selected to represent the major religious groupings as well as the atheist and non-religious-practising parts of the population. We will ask them to recall the important events of their lives, particularly births, marriages and death, and the role of religious and secular ritual and ceremony in enhancing the meaning of these events. We will also ask them to reflect on the changes that they have experienced in this area of social life since the latter part of the 20th century, and how the decreasing (increasing in Bulgaria and Romania) role of religious and secular ritual and ceremony has affected them and their families. \n\nThe research will be conducted by a team of oral historians and gerontologists, who will meet regularly to design and coordinate the data collection, analysis and presentation of results in all three countries. The results will be disseminated in oral history, gerontology and social science contexts. This project will help promote the study of religion which has been greatly neglected in oral history and gerontology across in Europe and will hopefully lead to funding of a more representative European study. It should also act as a stimulus to further cooperation between gerontologists and oral historians in understanding the determinants of quality of life and adjustment across the life cycle.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In disseminating findings of previous research on the role of spiritual beliefs in adjustment to bereavement in later life as part of the ESRC funded 'Growing Older' programme, the principal applicant consulted with the Department of Health as well as major UK charities in the field of ageing, Age Concern England and Help the Aged. Both of these organisations produced documents for wider circulation highlighting the findings of this and other related studies, which have demonstrated the need for considering older people's spiritual needs, defined in their broadest terms to incorporate sense of existential meaning, within policy on enhancing quality of life in later life. Prof. Coleman has also contributed to the development of the work of the Leveson Foundation for Ageing, Spirituality and Social Policy, set up specifically to consider these issues. He will continue to work with them and with the successor organisation to Age Concern England and Help the Aged (which are joining together to form one organisation in the course of 2009) on these issues. \n\nThe senior researchers will also disseminate their findings among relevant religious and secular (e.g. Association of Funeral Directors) organisations concerned with issues of ritual and ceremony at key points in life.The principal applicant is currently conducting research in collaboration with relevant professional groups as funeral directors and hospital chaplains, and also has good links with ministers of most of the major Christian dominations (including the Eastern Orthodox Churches who have a major presence in both Bulgaria and Romania), Islamic, Jewish and other religious leaders.\n\nAs the study focuses in large part on Bulgaria and Romania, it is hoped that it will contribute to a better understanding of these poorly understood European countries, the most recent entrants to the EU. The principal applicant is actively involved in promoting cultural links for both Bulgaria and Romania within the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80499</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Demonstrates a striking contrast between gradual secularization in the West and the impact of violent political and anti-religious upheaval in the East which has not been as successful in breaking the continuity of religious traditions. Besides indicating the importance of religious diversity in Europe, the project illustrates the interplay between personal biography and historic change, and examines the significance of the concept of vicarious religion ('believing without belonging') in diverse contexts, the particular importance of death rituals for continuing bonds, and the contribution of religious faith to well-being in later life.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research can be used to describe and understand differing attitudes to religious faith and practice across Eastern and Western Europe.
