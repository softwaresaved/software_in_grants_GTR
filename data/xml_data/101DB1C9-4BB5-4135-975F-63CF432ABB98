Amateur theatre has an active place in the social and cultural life of many communities, despite receiving little intervention from funding councils, charities, local authorities and professional theatre. Moreover, the term 'amateur' is often used disparagingly; professional actors continue to deride amateur dramatics for their production values, often vociferously, despite many performers having started their careers as amateurs. For theatremakers on the political Left, the perceived conservatism of 'am drams' has been seen an obstacle to community theatre. Academics have often been conspiciously silent on the subject of amateur dramatics, favouring forms of theatre that are more palatable to radical politics and more in tune with metropolitan taste. Yet for the participants in amateur dramatics themselves, the choice of repertoire, the craft of performance and the production values are deeply important.

This study will take the social and artistic intentions of amateur dramatic companies seriously. It will consider systems of apprenticeship and leadership, how casts and crew refine and develop their craft, and how their commitment to rehearsal, production, competitions and festivals shapes their skills as theatre-makers. The study will consider the social aspects of amateur dramatics: how participation fosters friendship and romance, weathers conflict and fall-outs, and sustains family involvement and community participation across generations. It will examine how amateur dramatics is viewed by audiences and valued as heritage, and the contribution made to productions by the wider communities in which they are situated. 

The research will focus particular attention on amateur dramatics in constructed communities, that is communities conceived to fulfil particular social and institutional functions (military bases, naval ships), or designed as utopian imaginaries of urban life (Garden Cities/ post-war New Towns and suburbia) and rural villages constructed in the transition from organic communities to commuter dormitories. By researching cultural activity in non-metropolitan communities, it will address questions of international significance by asking how and if amateur dramatics contributes to sustaining and revitalising communities; whether amateur theatre companies resist change or adapt to new circumstances; why people give time to amateur dramatics; how participation enhances wellbeing and raises the quality of community life. This research will be conducted with and by members of amateur dramatic companies, who will share their insights and local knowledge.

It is significant that this research is proposed in a context in which creativity is recognised as valuable commodity in globalised, knowledge-based economies and State funding for the professional arts has been cut. In times of austerity and recession, funding for participatory arts as a means of promoting social cohesion has been eroded. Nonetheless, there is a widespread cultural anxiety that although we may be increasingly globally networked, many people scarcely know their neighbours, leading to loneliness and social isolation. This makes questions about the practice of amateur arts all the more pressing. There is urgent need to understand the social, cultural and economic significance of amateur dramatics - as one of the most social, sociable and durable cultural practices. The project will culminate in a research festival that will bring together amateur and professional theatremakers, academics and cultural policy-makers to share practice and experience, and consider future possibilities. The outcomes will be of interest to cultural policy, voluntary arts organisations, Naval and military institutions, local authorities and heritage groups, as well as to the amateur dramatic companies themselves. By studying amateur dramatics in the past and present, this research will inform the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has the potential for impact for a broad range of project partners at national and local level, and individual community participants across the amateur dramatics community of interest. In addition to reaching public audiences, the research will benefit three specific interest groups and organisations:

1) The Third Sector: National and Local Organisations that support Amateur and Voluntary Arts
This project builds on partnerships developed with national bodies in the sector including Voluntary Arts (VA) and the Little Theatre Guild through the AHRC funded Connected Communities study, The Role of Grassroots Arts Activities in Communities (completed in 2011). New relationships have been forged with national and local cultural organisations including the Royal Navy Theatre Association (RNTA), the National Operatic and Drama Association (NODA) and Letchworth Garden City Heritage Foundation (LGCHF). The research is designed to draw on existing knowledge of the sector from these project partners, and seeks to understand whether amateur dramatics contributes to sustaining and revitalising geographically located communities. Representatives from project partnerships are included on the Advisory Board, acting as expert consultants at regular meetings through the research. The research will generate bespoke internal reports for partner organisations that will address their specific concerns about place of amateur dramatics in community life. The impact of this research has international reach through the case studies: military personel from many nations participate in amateur drama; Garden Cities and New Towns across the world are being reimagined to address 21st century challenges; cultural changes in rural communities affect many European countries.

2) Community Stakeholders: Amateur Dramatics Companies 
The project's three detailed case studies involve community participants in a variety of amateur dramatic groups from the Royal Navy, in New Towns and Garden Cities and suburban communities along the Metropolitan Line, and in the villages of Devon. These stakeholders will be co-creators of knowledge, by sharing their creativity and craft, through oral histories, and in the shared production of website material and digtial archives. We will collaborate with key local organisations to produce content for exhibitions documenting the history and contemporary practice of amateur dramatics. The project culminates with a Research Festival to showcase the work of partner amateur dramatic companies and, by linking amateur and professional theatre-makers, will open the work beyond the world of amateur participants to professional arts organisations.

3) Cultural Policy-Makers
The project will offer the first complete survey of contemporary amateur dramatic companies in England. It is focused on amateur dramatic companies that are specifically set up to make theatre, rather than amateur performance in professional theatre or voluntary organisations that include amateur drama amongst their activities (The Women's Institute or the Scouts, for example). The research will address issues of social inclusivity, asking whether amateur drama connects or divides communities, particularly in areas of cultural and ethnic diversity. The Research Festival will curate conversations about the strategic implications of the research with policy-makers from the Arts Council England, the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport, local government bodies, heritage foundations and amateur theatre associations. The reports, developed in collaboration with research partners, will speak to this audience and will be available for wide dissemination. The research will provide valuable evidence about the amateur use of recreational spaces, generate data about how leisure time is spent, and analyse how, and if, amateur dramatics contributes to connecting communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>378247</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TaPRA PG Symposium Keynote Address (Warwick)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3C58C310-6258-4899-ACAF-DC3B8DBE42DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A keynote address 'From Military Campaigns to Mother Goose: why does the navy do theatre?' delivered at the annual TaPRA PG Symposium</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RAPPT: Amateur theatre conference presentation Cork, Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5501044C-C286-434C-97AE-63EBFC51AFB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a conference for researchers (both amateur and professional) undertaking research on the history and current practices of amateur theatre.

Myself and Helen Nicholson ran a workshop, with a proportion of the attendees which, explored the themes of 'objects telling stories and 'creative spaces of amateur theatre' (named 'Stories from objects, places and theatres'). In this workshop we talked about our own research and engaged the participants in activities that fuelled discussions around these themes. 

Later on in the day, Sarah Penny and I helped to chair a discussion with a group of attendees. The discussion focussed on the 'ecologies of amateur theatre'. It was an opportunity to discuss current trends and future plans with amateur drama practitioners. We asked: What are the major challenges facing amateur theatre makers at the moment and how would you like to be supported? What new directions might emerge in the future? What are the opportunities for future development? How might our research contribute?

Sarah Penny and I also curated a small exhibition for the event. Set up in the event space, we exhibited four themes connected to our research on amateur theatre: 'creative spaces', 'place making', 'archive' and 'heritage'. The exhibition was made up of primary and secondary sources, photographs, quotes from amateur theatre practitioners and a small instillation. Attendees of the event engaged with this exhibition throughout the day and it facilitated many conversations around these themes.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://amateurdramaresearch.com/reflecting-on-amateur-theatre-an-event/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper at Community as Beneficiary: The Role of Amateur Performance Symposium (University College Cork)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>088E38D2-A978-446A-880D-1479B287653A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Symposium paper entitled 'Entertaining Jack at Sea: The SODS Operas at Scapa Flow' at the Community as Beneficiary: The Role of Amateur Performance Symposium.

Abstract:
This paper reflects on the making of amateur theatre, and how the processes and spaces of making can illuminate the 'crafting' of a community; developing the appreciation that 'making is connecting' (Gauntlett, 2011). Amateur dramatics has long been a site overlooked by the academy in discussions around the social production of art. Yet within geography and beyond, discussions around artistic practice, craft and skill by way of creative practice and process have gained significant attention. So have the spaces of artistic production, the artists' studio (Bain, 2004, Sj&amp;ouml;holm, 2012) and the everyday 'vernacular spaces of creativity' (Edensor 2010). I aim to investigate the creative processes outside the realms of capitalist value, in amongst the making and the spaces of the amateur dramatist, in a town that was designed on the principles of the Arts and Crafts Movement.

Of specific interest to this paper is the Sunday set building mornings at the Settlement (Letchworth Garden City), in which volunteers from the Settlement Players helped to construct the living room of Fey, a character in their upcoming play. Drawing on (auto) ethnographic research and participatory work conducted with The Settlement Players, this paper will offer an analysis of the amateur dramatist as a craftsman 'dedicated to good work for its own sake' (Sennett, 2008). By positioning myself in the making, I seek to contribute to the understanding of human labour in amateur theatre, whilst illuminating the social and material relationships therein.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/theatre_s/staff/nadine_holdsworth/amateur_creativity/rh162_amateur_dramatics_programme.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Seminar (Warwick)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0E03EDA8-2422-4AD9-A6C2-5EB66D3A259E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper 'Staging Place and Heritage' delivered as part of Warwick's research seminar series, which prompted questions and debate about the challenges of researching amateur theatre.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Geographical Society - IBG Annual International Conference (University of Exeter)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4D403D0E-1A9F-4CFB-A53F-5C4CEA2A3F2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Myself and fellow Royal Holloway PhD student, Katie Boxall (Geography Department) chaired and convened two session at the conference named 'Geographies of Amateur Creativities: Spaces, Practices and Experiences 1 &amp;amp; 2'.

Smaller events have been integral to the research process. Our findings are being used by: 
National amateur theatre organisations, particularly The Little Theatre Guild, to demonstrate the ways in which building-based amateur theatres are a cultural hub in local communities, offering a range of cultural activities and forms of creative participation;
Third Sector organisations to advocate for increased visibility of amateur theatre in local cultural, particularly in non-metropolitan spaces. 
Individual amateur companies to demonstrate the cultural value of their work, particularly where they are supported by employers and local authorities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A54BBCC2-B1D5-4574-9A4F-B0AB435235B7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As the first study of amateur theatre, this research demonstrates how amateur theatre companies form significant part of twenty-first century British cultural life. Participants are actively engaged in the processes of making performance, offering both a challenge to conventional conceptions of cultural participation as passive consumption, and an opportunity to reconsider debates around the value of culture. As most amateur arts practice is not directly seeking public subsidy, the amateur theatre sector provides a strategic position from which to assess contemporary questions around the cultural life of communities and nations, and the value and importance of that culture in creating and sustaining a good life for individuals and communities. The findings of this research project are here focused on four inter-related areas: how the history of amateur theatre illuminates contemporary practice; the significance of creative participation for individuals; the role of amateur theatre in place-making and community-building; and the importance of amateur theatre in the cultural economy and ecology. 

Understanding the present from the past
This research project traced the history of amateur theatre from the long twentieth-century to the contemporary moment. It revealed that amateur theatre had evolved from a movement, associated with community cohesion and social idealism in the early twentieth-century, to a twenty-first century community pastime, largely overlooked by cultural policy-makers. Participation in amateur theatre reflects changing work patterns from a jobs-for-life industrial economy to more diverse work patterns, with consequences for how free time is understood and experienced. Contemporary amateur theatre is responding to twenty-first century challenges, where finding time for amateur theatre amidst completing demands is presenting new challenges for participants. 

Amateur theatre and the creative self
Throughout this research, we have found that participating in amateur theatre provides a space for people to explore and express different dimensions of their identities that may not have an outlet in their professional or domestic lives. Representing imagined roles punctuates the everyday lives of participants, and creates encounters that are socially significant as well as sociable. There is also a strong commitment to enhancing knowledge and understanding through professionally-led workshops, competition and adjudication. Informal systems of apprenticeship within amateur theatre companies enable experienced theatre-makers to pass on their knowledge through systems of shadowing or co-production. This reflects the resurgence of interest in amateur creativity in twenty-first century popular culture, where interest in crafts and the hand-made is being revitalised, sometimes seen in contrast to the commodified leisure industries. 

Amateur theatre, place-making and community-building
The association between community-building and craft-making was central to early twentieth century social reformists, where William Morris was a source of inspiration. The research revealed traces of this attitude today, where commitment to the crafts of amateur theatre-making (both on-stage and back-stage) are valued for the opportunities to bring communities together across generations. Amateur theatre is often a life-long interest, with consequences not only for individual participants but also creating a sense of place and belonging. Place-making happens in the public spaces of amateur theatre performances, where local ('real') people are recognised in different roles, and also in the process of theatre-making and in the social activities associated with membership of a society. Often documented in scrapbooks and now on social media, amateur theatre performances have become part of local heritage and the cultural memory of place. There is also evidence that amateur theatre sustains cultural identities in displaced or diasporic communities, and although amateur theatre is diverse (age, gender, socio-economic, LGBT, illness/ disability, diasporic communities), there are fewer BAME members of amateur companies. 

Amateur theatre and the cultural economy/ ecology
The significance of amateur theatre to the cultural economy has often been ignored, but our findings show that amateur theatre has not only contributed to place-making on a local level, it has also shaped the national cultural and theatre repertoire. Contemporary plays have entered the national repertoire through amateur performance (most notably, Pinter's The Birthday Party was staged by amateurs in 1959 when it had been widely ignored by professional theatre), and plays reach wide audiences though amateur productions. Amateur theatre has also contributed to the cultural ecology by sustaining, filling, renovating and building local structural assets such as small halls, meeting rooms, informal public spaces, theatres and galleries. In turn, these serve as a cultural 'hub', used not only by amateur theatre companies to stage plays, but also to screen live theatre, provide spaces for creative activity such as choirs or reading groups, thereby serving the wider local community in multiple ways. Our findings suggest that amateur theatre is an important cultural asset, generating social bonds and social capital, and placing amateur theatre as an important part of the local cultural ecology, particularly in non-metropolitan areas.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our pathways to impact statement identified the involvement of community stakeholders (members of local amateur theatre companies) and national amateur theatre organisations in the research and as beneficiaries of the findings. In addition, we expected that cultural policy-makers on a local and national level might use our findings. In addition, we have found that professional theatres are interested in our findings (see award AH/N001567/1, For Love or Money? Collaboration between amateur and professional theatre). 
Our research is being taken forward by amateur theatre companies as evidence for their contribution to local cultural life and to the creative lives of individuals. It might be used to generate further understanding of history and heritage of amateur theatre, including the processes of archiving. National organisations, particularly the Little Theatre Guild and Voluntary Arts, might use our findings to articulate the particular contribution amateur theatre makes to 21st century cultural life, its significance in the wider cultural ecology, and its role in sustaining a national canon and repertoire of new plays. 

Policy-makers might use the findings as evidence for the contribution amateur theatre makes to key government policies relating to place-making and cultural participation, particularly in non-metropolitan areas. There is emerging interest from Arts Council England, DCMS and other national organisations (evidenced in attendance at a research seminar) in the potential for policy for this research. 

Academic beneficiaries cross disciplinary boundaries, and the multi-disciplinary seminar and the forthcoming book (The Ecologies of Amateur Theatre, Palgrave, 2018) shaping agendas and contributing debates in shaping the emergent field of amateur studies. The research has a symbolic value in increasing the cultural capital of amateur theatre by providing greater visibility for amateur creativity in the academy and beyond.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>754864E7-5359-4A3A-9355-DB7D519389EE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including
