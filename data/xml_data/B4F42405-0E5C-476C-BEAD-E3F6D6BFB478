This will be the first meeting on expansion held in the UK and one of its main aims is to popularize this rapidly evolving subject to the UK mathematical community. Expander graphs have proved to be an immensely useful concept, both in Pure Mathematics and in Computer Science. On one hand they provide models for efficient and robust networks and very fast algorithms for solving computational problems. On the other hand expanders and more generally expansion properties in groups have been the subject of much recent research in Pure Mathematics involving tools from group theory, combinatorics, representation theory, analysis and number theory. More concretely deep connections have emerged between expansion and properties of generating sets of simple groups, sum-product results in additive combinatorics, 3-dimensional topology, measurable group theory. One cannot help but think that the major results in this area are still to be discovered. Some of the leading experts have already accepted to speak and attending Ph. D. students will be exposed to the latest methods spanning a large selection of topics. The other aim of the workshop is to stimulate discussion among its participants and further research in this exciting area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this workshop will be twofold: Immediate impact is the introduction of new ideas and skills to the UK mathematical community in particular to PhD students and postdocs. The beneficiaries will be the participants of the workshop. This impact will be achieved by advertising the workshop via web page, email mail list, personal contact and among the participants of the South England Profinite Group meetings. Part of the talks of the workshops will have an introductory character. Longer term impact will be the further research stimulated by this workshop. Direct beneficiaries will be the mathematicians working in the diverse areas covered by expanders: combinatorics, number theory, analysis, representation theory, theoretical computer science and group theory (more details in the impact section of the proposal). This impact will be achieved by stimulating further discussions among the participants and presenting open problems in the area. The results will be published in leading mathematical journals and made freely available on preprint servers like arxiv.org. Further the invited speakers know many of the experts in the above areas personally and will communicate the results to them directly. In the long term, the skills for studying expansion could be useful for other mathematical problems and will benefit the mathematical community as a whole. Even longer term impact may be achieved if the theoretical research stimulated by the workshop could eventually be applied to practical problems in computer science and designing faster networks and algorithms, potentially benefiting all sections of society. To this purpose this research will be communicated to the computer science community via publication in journals, conference talks and personal communication.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15333</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H043349/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
