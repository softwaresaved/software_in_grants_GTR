These civic 'self-help' websites are designed to help people undertake a range of important tasks that include contacting politicians, sending complaints to public bodies and making government more accountable and transparent by opening up information for public scrutiny. The British charity mySociety has been a global pioneer in this field, developing new kinds of service and running domestic websites with traffic of almost 5 million annual visitors. While we have evidence of who uses the site, how it is used and how often, we lack a detailed understanding of the subsequent and wider societal impact these services have on their visitors. This project will seek to provide this understanding through a systematic quantitative and qualitative study of mySociety users over a three month period. The work will benefit the following groups in several key ways:

* Social policy makers: Politicians and public servants would be given an important new source of evidence regarding the role that digital services and particularly these civic portals can play in improving the quality of public life and the health of communities. This is an area that has been underexplored to date due to lack of good quality data on the users of the sites and systematic analysis of their effects. If shown to have positive consequences for strengthening citizenship and increasing democratic accountability then the project would help policy makers to more efficiently channel government spending toward these types of initiative.

* Site developers: Innovators in the digital realm who run these sites lack clear, reliable evidence to assess what impact they are making and whether some types of facilities are better than others for promoting the outcomes they seek. This study will help them to pinpoint where to invest their resources to ensure maximum return on their investment.

* Funders, specifically philanthropic and public sector funders of innovative social projects need better evidence and comparable metrics to understand if their current investments in socially positive digital technologies are yielding the rewards that would be desired. This is an especially important group to serve, given that funding in these fields is at an all time high.

* Academics and researchers in the digital democracy and civic activity will gain access to a new and unique data source that will allow for a better understanding of the extent to which the internet and mobile technologies are or are not impacting on the quality of community life and democratic practices.

The report was also picked up and promoted to an international audience through an independent blog OpeningParliament.org, an online forum intended to help connect the world's civic organizations engaged in monitoring, supporting and opening up their countries' parliaments and legislative institutions. http://blog.openingparliament.org/post/116930271448/openparl-news-brief-april-20-2015 

mySociety staff and their users were the primary consumers of the findings. We set out a series of practical and also methodological recommendations for their practice from the research as part of an executive summary. We discussed these recommendations in person with the Director Tom Steinberg and Research Director Rebecca Rumbul and by email. Our findings were seen by the Director as important in highlighting the need for an expansion of the sites to include a more collective space for users to find one another locally in order to discuss and possibly collaborate on activities offline.

The formal launch of the report in London brought together staff of mySociety, a number of users of the sites and other professionals seeking to use online tools to promote democracy. The key findings of the report were presented to the audience and then discussed afterward. This discussion led to a series of specific points being raised for mySociety to take forward and follow-up. These were:

? The findings revealed that use of the sites is skewed toward those with greater socioeconomic resources, ethnic minorities and women were also under-represented. This indicates that more needs to be done to appeal to a wider demographic. 

? The need for closer analysis of first time users was evident since they do appear to have a more diverse demographic profile than regular users. Thus a further recommendation that arose from our work was that mySociety could look more closely at how it might widen its reach in this regard? 

? When measuring the success of mySociety sites it is important to place this in context and particularly to understand geographic patterns in terms of where users are concentrated. Is it the case that particular local authorities are more responsive to requests for information or action by users? If so, does this then increase the likelihood that users will use the sites again, creating something of a virtuous circle?

? The collective aspect of the site is under-exploited. Users of the site express a desire to help their local community and based on our over-time analysis this appears to be developed further if they are regular users of the sites. It would be worthwhile, therefore, for mySociety to add some more collective features to the site that would allow people to debate, discuss issues at minimum. Taking this further it might be possible to offer a facility whereby people can then take action with others to resolve an issue (online and offline). More specifically there could be an 'ask others' button whereby individuals can start a community action. 

? In the FixmyStreet site that mySociety run to help people address transport problems in their local area it would be useful to include a facility to allow councils to respond to complaints raised and why a specific problem has not yet been addressed. 

The findings have been presented in conference or workshop papers to academic audiences in the UK and internationally (France and the U.S.) Our findings regarding the impact of mySociety sites on communal activities and local participation were received with great interest. In particular our unique methodological approach in which we link three kinds of longitudinal data to present a multi-dimensional view on the mobilizing effect of mySociety sites has attracted considerable attention and resulted in an invitation to submit a paper for a special issue of New Media and Society, one of the leading journals in the Internet and Politics field. The paper has now been accepted. Rebecca Rumbul Director of Research at MySociety said of the Journal output and scientific impact of the work &amp;quot;I am really pleased that the study is going into journal publication, as I think it's an important contribution to the sparse literature on civic tech, and will definitely have further reaching benefits, although of course those will be slightly longer term.&amp;quot;

Reflecting on the wider impact of the work for mySociety Dr. Rumbul wrote in an email (28.08.15) to the PI that &amp;quot;The report has been really useful internally in helping to inform our own research agenda and was integral in identifying some areas of potential interest both when looking at our sites in the UK, and also when we were examining implementations abroad.&amp;quot; She also noted that mySociety had been in a state of transition in the preceding 6 months given the departure of Director, Tom Steinberg who commissioned the work. This has meant fuller consideration and implementation of the report's findings and recommendations needed to wait until the new CEO was appointed (which has now happened). One further aspect of the report that she identified as likely to be particularly useful going forward were the opportunities it highlighted for potential collaboration by mySociety with other groups. As a small NGO, the budgetary resources of mySociety are limited. This report was significant in in highlighting the link between site usage and 'real world' activities provided a basis for thinking about how mySociety could engage with larger partners to extend its reach real-world and community activity.

Since the conclusion of the award mySociety have informed us that they have had 238 page views of the research paper we uploaded to their site, with 187 of those being unique users. 
A follow up email request for feedback among those who participated in the more qualitative component of the research - the time diaries - prompted a range of responses from respondents in which they reflected on their experience and how it had affected their lives. One respondent wrote &amp;quot;I found the project interesting as it made me more aware of what I was contributing to my community and made me feel I wanted to do more.&amp;quot; Another commented that &amp;quot;The survey was a positive process for me, in that it tended to discipline my thoughts and the structure of my daily activities the process did have intellectual benefits for me&amp;quot; A third noted that &amp;quot;I think, that on refection, it was an excellent way for the participants to focus on issues raised and to extrapolate the topics relevant to 'mysociety'&amp;quot;

During 2016 the project methodology and findings were used to inform a training programme for community and third sector organizations conducted by researchers at the University of Manchester. The project was entitled Knowing-how: Co-producing a social research training programme for the Third Sector&amp;quot; and our materials were used in Workshop 4 to teach participants about the value of mixed methods.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0108AED3-A64A-48E4-9D35-29C5F4536163</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research project examined the impact of using new forms of 'civic technology' on individuals' levels of community and political engagement. We focused specifically on the sites of mySociety, an online organization that promotes citizen empowerment by providing digital 'do-it-yourself'' (DIY) tools that people can use to better understand how the political system works and take action to solve local problems. The work had three main objectives: (1) to understand whether and how such sites mobilize people to participate in their communities and also in the wider political system; (2) to adopt a unique mixed-methods approach that would link individual stories with a broader picture of overall use of the sites and provide a more complete account of their impact over time; (3) to offer practical insights to mySociety about the effectiveness of their sites and recommendations for improvement. In terms of mobilization, our key findings were that although use of the sites does not appear to be linked to changes in levels of political engagement over the short-term, regular use does appear to stimulate a 'virtuous circle' of increasing involvement in community affairs and the value of collective action at the local level that we termed 'community efficacy'. Methodologically we advanced the study of online participation by developing an innovative mixed methodology that directly linked time diaries completed by several hundred people over a three month period with focus group discussion and quantitative evidence from surveys of mySociety users. This provided a much richer and more reliable insight into how individuals use mySociety resources and how far it directly or indirectly prompted subsequent changes in their attitudes and behaviour. In particular it provided the basis for our identifying the sense of 'community efficacy' that the sites help to develop among users. On a practical level we identified an opportunity for mySociety to expand its impact through provision of more collective spaces on its sites where users could find others with shared interests and pursue action together. We also revealed significant differences between first-time and regular users of the sites that suggest the sites may not be working as effectively as possible to retain harder to reach groups that are less engaged politically. mySociety were particularly interested in our findings about the links between the use of mySociety tools and community efficacy and noted that our &amp;quot;key findings would be of interest to [other] community groups&amp;quot; who could promote mySociety tools &amp;quot;to individuals interested in their communities but without the initial efficacy to use them.&amp;quot; Finally, through this research we have shown how academics and democratic practitioners can work together to conduct theoretically informed and methodologically rigorous research that can be used to identify concrete steps that can increase the impact of their work and result in work published in major international journals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will inform future academic work in this area by providing unique new data on the users of 'civic technology' sites in the UK. Also our methodology is one of the first to integrate time diary evidence with focus group discussion and aggregate survey data to understand the impact of these e-democracy resources on individuals and wider society and provides a template for future researchers to use. Our methodology is also being put to use by practitioners. Steven Clift, Director of the e-Democracy project in Minnesota who attended the launch of our project report requested a copy of our survey methodology to help develop his current work in this field. Our recommendations regarding the need for communal spaces in our project report have been actively considered by mySociety. More generally our findings that the sites can help to increase levels of community efficacy provide mySociety and similar groups with the basis for securing support and funding to promote their work. The Democratic Society contacted the PI following publication of the report to discuss a possible research project. Specifically, discussions were held with staff of The Democratic Society and one of the Board of Governors who expressed interest in working together to develop a project that could help identify and produce practical initiatives on how social media use might help to engage young people in politics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EA4B8FE0-4065-4407-81CD-02CEE4A53A85</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.mysociety.org/files/2014/12/manchester.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>World Bank Report on Delivering Benefits of Information Technology to Society</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12C75526-21E8-4801-91FB-CEFE94664742</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23347</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6FB1A75B-16A1-4378-95A1-6B94C3694EBC"><gtr:id>6FB1A75B-16A1-4378-95A1-6B94C3694EBC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effects of online civic 'self-help' websites on civic and community engagement</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>N/A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/38a51acd89883836ee8ca3396f013882"><gtr:id>38a51acd89883836ee8ca3396f013882</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cantijoch, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7F49E116-DCE8-4FDB-A085-DFE723A9CE43"><gtr:id>7F49E116-DCE8-4FDB-A085-DFE723A9CE43</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effects of online civic 'self-help' websites on civic and community engagement&amp;quot;</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/38a51acd89883836ee8ca3396f013882"><gtr:id>38a51acd89883836ee8ca3396f013882</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cantijoch, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/71CA7A0A-34EF-48CB-AEED-898F5B2682D6"><gtr:id>71CA7A0A-34EF-48CB-AEED-898F5B2682D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Its not about me, its about my community: A mixed-method study of civic websites and community efficacy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New Media &amp;
