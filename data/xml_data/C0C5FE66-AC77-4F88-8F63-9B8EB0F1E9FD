In line with the Chinese theme of the gallery, the case is full of early 20th-century Chinese artefacts - a dress, shoes, a fan, a box - and the accompanying text explains that 'with great fortunes to be made from trading with China,' the Larrinaga family 'came to Liverpool to make money'. A visitor to the gallery might briefly remark the adjective 'Basque', but there is no further explanation, as the family's story is absorbed into the wider narrative of Anglo-Chinese history. Across the gallery, it is a similar story. An 1898 painting of the family's Anselma de Larrinaga steamship sits unremarked atop a large panel that contrasts Spanish colonialism in South America, which 'brought disaster for indigenous people and their cultures' with the economic progress brought to the region by the British presence. It is unclear whether the painting is there to represent Spanish destruction or British investment.

The ambiguous presence of the Larrinaga family in the Museum of Liverpool - marked as 'Basque' but absorbed into the interplay between three overarching imperial histories - encapsulates the ambiguity of the Basque interimperial subject that is the focus of this project. The Larrinaga family, like their wealthier (and dirtier) contemporaries the Zuluetas, were simultaneously proud Basques, bourgeois British residents, patriotic Spanish expats and ruthless exploiters of the commercial and maritime networks connecting Liverpool, London, Bilbao, Havana and Manila. Throughout the 19th century, both families built dense networks of transoceanic economic and cultural connections in the triangular space linking the UK, the Basque Country, and Spain's principal remaining colonies in Cuba and the Philippines. Both families were involved in the legitimate business of empire and in its dirty counterpart, the trade in African slaves and, later, Chinese coolies. And both families left a significant cultural, material and - in the descendants of the employees, associates and slaves who, willingly or otherwise, accompanied their transoceanic migrations - human legacy. 

This project reconstructs the histories, networks and legacies of these two Basque commercial families. Detailed archival work in institutional, local, regional and informal archives will give rise to two scholarly monographs, at least six journal articles and a portfolio of working papers. These will allow us to understand how the Larrinagas, Zuluetas and their associates crossed imperial, colonial, maritime and linguistic boundaries to operate transoceanic networks that did the work of empire even as they defied imperial sovereignty. Our public engagement activity across all five case study cities will capture the resonances of these networks at the local, community, individual and family level, gathering, recording, and interpreting the stories of the people who inhabited these networks, the places they lived, worked and are remembered, and the traces we can still find of them today. The project web platform, including working papers, a geotagged database and community digital archive, will allow researchers and stakeholders to gain deep and broad insights into the Zuluetas' and Larrinaga's activity and legacy through a range of media, including text, maps, images and podcasts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project's engagement with specific local and individual case studies drawn from five prominent, international port cities as well as with the 'grand narratives' of British and Spanish nation and empire, creates exciting possibilities for impact across a range of audiences. Our four key impact-related objectives are: 

1) to promote awareness of the UK's plurilingual, pluricultural Hispanic history and its continued resonances today
2) to bring together a range of stakeholders in the Basque dimension of British and Spanish imperial history, and Cuban and Philippine national and postcolonial history
3) to develop and test innovative methodologies for transnational, community-centred social, local, and family history research and dissemination
4) to facilitate access to academic research and its findings by third-sector and community audiences from both Anglophone and Spanish/Basque-speaking backgrounds who are excluded from traditional venues for scholarly research.

Public engagement and impact activities will be concentrated in the UK and the Basque Country, with occasional activities coinciding with fieldwork in Cuba and the Philippines. The non-academic beneficiaries fall into two primary groups: heritage and knowledge professional s (especially, but not only, archivists, librarians and curators) and family, local and community historians. We have already developed links with individual family historians and heritage groups (e.g. the Hispanic Liverpool user community, London Basque Society, Filipino Home), local and family history organizations (e.g. Liverpool History Society, Liverpool and SW Lancashire Family History Society), archives and museums (e.g. Liverpool Central Library, the Merseyside Maritime Museum, the British Library, Euskal Museoa, the Institute of Philippine Culture). We will access new users and participants, especially in London, Bilbao and Manila, through local and regional media and institutions. The PI will work closely with Warwick's Press Office and Arts Impact Officer to identify new opportunities for media and public engagement.

Beneficiaries will be engaged by a range of methods throughout the life of the project. During the first two years, fieldwork trips to all five locations will permit face-to-face engagement through information sessions, workshops, CPD seminars, and site-specific activities such as co-creation of heritage trails, community soundscapes and digital storytelling. The digital dimension of the project, which includes a community collection, project database, and web platform, will permit digital engagement with researchers beyond our immediate research sites. For example, users will be able to participate in identification, tagging, interpretation and curation of resources within the community collection, repurpose database materials for their own needs, and comment or respond to working papers hosted on the web platform.

We will employ a range of monitoring methods, including questionnaires, post-it boards, follow-up reflection, comment systems, and Google Analytics, all in combination with the oversight of the Advisory Board and our regular milestones.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>433184</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N001184/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9EFA3E9E-2186-4589-A542-814A214E3D57</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic, Portguese &amp; Latin</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
