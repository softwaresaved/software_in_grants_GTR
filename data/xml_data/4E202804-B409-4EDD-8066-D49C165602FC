Caring for patients requires empathy: seeing the world from others? perspectives. The social sciences provide considerable insight into understanding the lives of others, often asking difficult questions that challenge stereotypes and encourage reflection. Theories and approaches drawn from the social sciences have much to offer nurse education. However, the extent to which this potential has been realised has been limited and fragmented across the discipline.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Social Science and Nursing seminar series brings together academics from nurse education, including individuals who have experience of drawing on the social sciences, together with social scientists whose work has been embedded in health. The series sets out to first develop theoretical reasons why nursing curricula should be informed by the social sciences. It then goes on to critically consider the challenges and opportunities presented by those theoretical ideas from the perspective of nurse education and, most importantly, nursing students. The final event then draws together ideas developed to suggest practical ways forward to realise potential and ensure ideas developed during the seminar series go on to become embedded in nurse education.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of the series will include the following groups:
- Patients
- Nurses
- And academics

Any improvement in nursing care will have benefits to patients. Critical and reflexive thinking are already well developed concepts within nursing but a more explicit utilisation of theories developed with the social sciences hold the potential to develop them still further and facilitate understanding (and thus responses) to caring for people whose lives are very different to those from which the nursing students understand. In so doing the series will also enable discussion of the theory practice-gap so as to explicitly recognise and challenge assumptions of both academics and practitioners and potentially empower nurses in their roles of ensuring the wellbeing of patients and coping with the realities of working in situations of limited resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20835</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 2 - Culture and Context</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E166427-EDCD-4E3C-A189-62F77ED34A44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the second or the series seminars. It brought together 30 academics and practitioners from the social sciences and nursing as well as students. Presentations sparked discussions around the ethnographic insights into the complexities of nursing care and how these can be better utilised in nurse education. The thinking generated revolved around several key topics. 

Presentations were provided as follows: Drs Iain Atherton and Richard Kyle provided an overview of the series and key ideas from the opening meeting; Professor Celia Lury (Centre for Interdisciplinary methodologies, University of Warwick); rofessor Kate Seers (RCN Research Institute, University of Warwick); Professor Gillian Hundt (Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick); and Professor Frances Griffiths, Professor of Medicine in Society, University of Warwick).

Responses were provided from the perspective of nurse education by Professor Gill Furze and Professor Jane Coad (both Nursing and Health Studies, University of Coventry).

Participants considered the benefits of students grappling with 'wicked problems': those problems for which there is no straightforward resolution. They also thought through the challenges of developing skills in nurses that better enables them to act as the interface between the complexities of diagnosis, treatments or nursing care and the lay patient. What came through from these discussions is the potential for honest insights into the realities of nursing rather than a more superficial medicalised or managerialised perspective. Drawing on insights into the culture of care has the potential to excite students, engaging them critically in challenging assumptions and facilitate empathetic nursing care.

Ideas from presentations and discussions have been incorporated into a blog on the seminar series web site and will contribute to a working paper. This blog and associated working paper will provide continuity into forthcoming seminars in the series where educationalists and students will consider how ideas might be practically applied.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://socialscienceandnursing.com/seminar2/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 3 - What could social science perspectives bring to the future of nursing leadership and practice?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>583DA42B-999A-44BF-B042-BB96B70E93C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The seminar provided an opportunity for social scientists working in health related fields to present to an audience that included nurse educationalists. It brought together 30 academics and practitioners from the social sciences, health care research and nursing as well as student representation. 

The seminar opened with an overview of the first two seminars provided by Dr Iain Atherton and Dr Richard Kyle (two of the applicants responsible for taking forward the series).

Presentations were made by the following academics: Professor Graham Martin (Professor of Health Organisation and Policy, University of Leicester); Professor Davina Allen, School of Healthcare Sciences, University of Cardiff; and Professor Ellen Annandale, Head of Department of Sociology, University of York.

Responses to these papers were provided from the perspective of nursing education by: Professor Dame Jessica Corner, Dean, Facility of Health Sciences, University of Southampton; and Professor Stephen Tee, Associate Dean (Education), Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College London.

Discussion was generated as to the implications of ideas highlighted by the presented papers. Professor Dame Jessica Corner later stated in her opening speech as chair to the Council of Deans:

'I recently took part in an ESRC seminar series on social science and nurse education - a collaboration between King's College London, the Universities of Warwick, Nottingham and Stirling and the RCN. I participated in a seminar looking at the future of nursing leadership and practice post-Francis, with extraordinary inputs from Davina Allen from the University of Cardiff, Graham Martin from the University of Leicester and Ellen Annandale from the University of York. The picture of nursing work that shone through these studies is not reflected in the extant narrative, in the NMC code or in current discussions about selection for values and compassion in practice. This was a picture of nursing in a world dominated by managing an entirely fragmented system of care, both within institutions and between care settings, where nurses act as critical 'glue' shaping communication to bridge failing systems driven by managerialist prerogatives (waiting times, productivity models, efficiency, audits and data dashboards). This is not encompassed within a professional code focussed around compassionate interaction with single patients, yet it is a key and ongoing risk.'</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://socialscienceandnursing.com/seminar3/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 1 - Placing Patients' Lives</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>196A1910-C2E1-491A-8B20-FF0D86A0E839</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the opening seminar in the series. 30 people drawn from nurse education and geography attended. Considerable discussion was generated as to the current contributions of geography (and the social sciences more generally) as well as the challenges and opportunities to draw on them effectively. The meeting specifically focussed on the contributions of geography to nurse education. Five geographers presented work with experts drawn from nurse education acting as respondents. Professor Gavin Andrews (McMaster University) provided an overview of the contributions geography has already made to nursing. He then went on to suggest how Non-Representational Theory might contribute to nursing education, facilitating nurses to see the experiences of patients in new and exciting ways. Drs Atherton and Kyle (members of the series organising team) then reflected on how Spencer and Whatmore's idea of 'bio-geography' might reinvigorate nursing education. Drs Sothern and Kesby then discussed their work on categorisation and risk in relation to blood transfusions. Respondents highlighted challenges with effectively utilising the ideas of social sciences in nursing education given overloaded curriculum and the availability of expertise in institutions. Similar concerns were raised by delegates as to how constraints might be overcome to enable greater use of ideas from the social sciences.


Key messages from the series were that the social sciences have contributed considerably to nurse education but much more could be achieved. Moving forward will require dialogue between groups with input to nurse education, particularly Higher Education Institutes and the Nursing and Midwifery Council. These ideas have been taken forward to be discussed and developed at later seminars.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://socialscienceandnursing.com/seminar1/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Principle Investigator was asked to contribute to a 'Thought leadership group' by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.
