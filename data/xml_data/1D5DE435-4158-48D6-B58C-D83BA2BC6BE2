Treated EBs and window screens trap mosquitoes inside houses after they enter, and force them into lethal contact with insecticides when they attempt to exit again. Experimental prototypes of insecticide-treated EBs proved an equivalent or superior alternative to indoor residual spraying for killing malaria vectors in standardized experimental huts in southern Tanzania. EBs required &amp;gt;5 times less insecticide than IRS, and co-treating with a binding agent (BA) could enhance durability so that they only need to be treated every 2 to 3 years.

The overall goal of this early-phase study is therefore to develop new, practical, scalable prototypes for EBs, which have been adapted to trap house-entering mosquitoes before they can attack the occupants, and can be readily installed in most rural African houses. We propose the following objectives for this early-phase study:
1. Re-assess the insecticidal efficacy of the previously evaluated experimental prototype EBs against An. funestus and An. arabiensis in experimental huts at 12, 18, 24 and 30 months post-treatment, to demonstrate long-term efficacy when co-treated with BA.
2. Develop a new EB trap design in a readily-manufactured &amp;quot;on a roll&amp;quot; format, together with broadly-scalable installation procedures, and demonstrate successful installation that reduces mosquito biting nuisance by &amp;gt;80% and assess user perceptions, in a random sample of rural Tanzanian houses.
3. Demonstrate equivalent insecticidal efficacy of the scalable EB trap-on-a-roll format to the previous experimental prototype, using experimental huts to measure impact on mosquito survival.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Eave baffles (EBs) are a simple housing modification using widely-available netting materials, which can be treated with existing insecticide formulations.
