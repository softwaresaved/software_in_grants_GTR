This drug can be used in a therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis which is estimated to affect 200 million women worldwide - approximately onetenth of women aged 60, one-fifth of women aged 70, two-fifths of women aged 80 and two-thirds of women aged 90. Osteoporosis is a reduction in bone density that increases the risk of fragility fractures particularly of the spine, hip and
wrist at a costs to the NHS of &amp;gt;&amp;pound;2bn per annum. The nano-enabled formulation proposed in response to the Technology Strategy Board call is expected to increase efficacy and patient adherence to the therapy regimen thereby reducing healthcare costs.

Protein based drugs make up &amp;gt;30% of drugs in development. Due to problems associated with their uptake into the body, the usual oral route of swallowing a pill is unsuitable. Therefore, as is the case for teriparatide, they usually require being injected. Injections have numerous limitations and are not liked by patients hence they often result in a poor adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. New methods of delivering proteins are therefore required. Critical Pharmaceuticals have developed a novel nano-structured permeation enhancer (CriticalSorb) that enables delivery of protein drugs via a simple nasal spray. Using this nanotechnology approach there are imminent clinical trials underway for the treatment of growth hormone deficient dwarfism. This therefore highlights a reduced risk in this proposal and the nasal delivery formulation for PTH(1-34).

This interdisciplinary collaborative research between the Division of Orthopaedic &amp;amp; Accident Surgery, the Division of Radiological and Imaging Sciences both within the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC), University of Nottingham and Critical Pharmaceuticals (CPL) BioCity Nottingham, raws on a wide range of experience and infrastructure. This will enable a rapid route to take the new nanotechnological development towards being available for the treatment of osteoporosis in NHS patients in the UK. A &amp;quot;belt and braces&amp;quot; approach is proposed, utilising established technologies to develop and
assess the formulation, whilst being complemented by new developing technologies within the University of Nottingham's imaging instrumentation, the nanoPET-CT high resolution scanner. Additionally we are proposing to install, commission and implement the latest quantitative semi-automated histopathology image analysis system to further define the biological effect of PTH on the key parameters of bone density and bone fragility. This research sits within an established research structure in the Division of Orthopaedics &amp;amp; Accident Surgery. This broad range of research includes: resorbable bone plates (Health Technology Devices, NIHR), which will provide an alternative to metal plates for the orthopaedic surgeon, particularly suited to use in children; the development of novel bone biomaterials, with a particular focus on reducing biomaterial related infection, which is a body of research that is rapidly approaching translation into clinical practice (Development Pathway Funding Scheme, MRC); the study of osteoarthritis related pain within the Arthritis Research UK Nottingham Pain Centre, a Priority Group within the University of Nottingham's research strategy. These in particular illustrate the integration of the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals. Through this network we have attracted a specialised clinical input into the steering committee from an international expert in the treatment of bone fragility in the elderly, and who has led a clinical trial using teriparatide administered through injection for the treatment of osteoporosis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Osteoporosis is a disease most prevalent in post-menopausal women (40% by age 80) that reduces bone density; however it does also affect elderly men. The reduction in bone density increases the risk of fragility fractures particularly of the spine, hip and wrist; significantly affecting quality of life and most importantly life expectancy. More than 300,000 patients suffer fragility fractures in the UK alone each year, with a cost of around &amp;pound;2 billion to the healthcare system. This disease is to become more prevalent with current changes in population demographics. Patient benefit of this and follow-on research will impact in the medium term. Many allied research projects will benefit from the methodological development proposed, research that is approaching a translational stage.
The potential benefit to society is clear, not only in terms of health and wellbeing but also in relation to health economics. Therefore the impact of the research will be wide ranging in nature. It will bring the nasal delivery of PTH(1-34) nearer to the clinic for the treatment of osteoporosis. Through this research within the collaborative environment we will be well placed to assess new drug candidates for the treatment of osteoporosis. This is a rich vein for commercial exploitation. Some drug candidates are yet to reach the pharmaceutical pipeline, such as those currently being developed within a new research project funded by the Medical Research Council in the School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham.

Specifically, it is imperative to convey that our proposal is the novel formulation of the product, teriparatide, which is currently available on prescription for the treatment of osteoporosis and is listed in the British National Formulary (BNF). The new intellectual property is the application of nanotechnology to a patented nasal delivery formulation for the drug teriparatide that is soon to come out of patent. In addition Professor Masud the clinical steer, Consultant andHonorary Professor, has strong commercial links with Ely Lilly who currently produce teriparatide.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>193474</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>86398</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Knowledge Transfer Secondments Accounts (Nottingham)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C6C1C378-0F0B-4D14-ACA8-A5F3811934D7</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The launch of the project was associated with a University of Nottingham press release. This resulted in an invitation from BBC Radio Nottingham to participate in the prime time slot - Drive Time. During the interview the collaboration between the University of Nottingham and Critical Pharmaceuticals was comprehensively discussed informing the general public of the EPSRC funded research and its potential societal benefits.

In addition, as the findings of the study were made, they have been relayed to the local public at outreach events organised by the University of Nottingham including a day where the University opened their doors to the community as an open day.

This expanding research portfolio has led to discussions and the implementation of a NDA to develop intranasal delivery systems with a multinational corporation, 3M. In addition, most recently a collaboration has developed the application of pharmaceutical nasal spray systems with the CSO of a UK Pharma company.</gtr:description><gtr:id>69181AB6-7398-434D-BFD0-E2CBB5064D45</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We are developing a nasal spray formulation of teriparatide. It is the only anabolic drug which is used to treat osteoporosis. The drug within this formulation is currently marketed in the UK as Forteo (Eli Lilly). This drug is being prescribed for the treatment of osteoporosis in those with a high risk of fragility fractures and is currently the only drug currently available with a mode of action that promotes the deposition of new bone (as opposed to preventing resorption).

Osteoporosis is estimated to affect 200 million women worldwide - approximately one tenth of women aged 60, one-fifth of women aged 70, two-fifths of women aged 80 and two-thirds of women aged 90.

Protein drugs, like teriparatide, cannot normally be delivered via the usual oral route of swallowing a pill, and tend to be delivered by injection. Injections have numerous limitations and are disliked by patients.

The liquid nasal spray formulations of teriparatide provided good pharmacokinetics data in preclinical studies, illustrating that the drug could enter the bloodstream. In addition,
the pharmacodynamic data (the effect of he drug on the body) in preclinical studies identified that the drug once it had entered the bloodstream was still in an active form and promoted the deposition of new bone.

When the liquid nasal spray formulation was translated from the preclinical animal models to the clinical setting, precisely where the nasal spray was deposited within the nasal cavity was quantified. Nasal spray formulations once deposited in the nasal cavity do not reside there permanently but are cleared. The time the formulation resided in the nasal cavity, which affects drug uptake, was measured. The amount of drug transferring from the nasal cavity into the bloodstream was measured (pharmacokinetics).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the clinical pharmacokinetic data it was identified that only a small quantity of the drug had entered the bloodstream. Insufficient to be of clinical or commercial interest. Follow-up work is currently addressing this issue by means of moving from a liquid based formulation to developing dry powder based formulation.

The research involving the dry powder formulations instead of liquid nasal sprays is also being funded through the EPSRC under the Knowledge Transfer Scheme. These dry powder formulations have already been tested in the laboratory and are currently progressing into further preclinical testing. The initial data is looking encouraging.

This research portfolio has led to discussions and the implementation of a NDA to develop intranasal delivery systems with a multinational corporation 3M. In addition, most recently discussions which should lead to a collaboration regarding pharmaceutical nasal spray delivery have opened with the CSO of a UK based Pharma company.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>39D76724-F777-4000-8F08-3F3D2BF11F7A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.criticalpharmaceuticals.com/products</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3B58323F-84AF-4F74-815C-D7BF6B465449"><gtr:id>3B58323F-84AF-4F74-815C-D7BF6B465449</gtr:id><gtr:title>Intranasal administration of PTH(1-34) for the treatment of osteoporosis - equivalence to subcutaneous injection at the neck of femur in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated preclinical model (Oral Presentation - Pearson).</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9c717571939f0b653a6412ed81f1b20c"><gtr:id>9c717571939f0b653a6412ed81f1b20c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/ACEB1653-F654-498A-A5C0-832F42936A16"><gtr:id>ACEB1653-F654-498A-A5C0-832F42936A16</gtr:id><gtr:title>Enhanced bioavailability of a nasal formulation of teriparatide with CriticalSorb? compared to a subcutaneous injection: A non -invasive approach for the treatment of osteoporosis (Poster Presentation)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2ed971e5c4fac8e0e24059c57a0314ba"><gtr:id>2ed971e5c4fac8e0e24059c57a0314ba</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jordan, F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5BE5A18D-95E0-4B68-B120-1FF007026108"><gtr:id>5BE5A18D-95E0-4B68-B120-1FF007026108</gtr:id><gtr:title>Computed tomography for preclinical anabolic studies of osteoporosis (Poster Presentation)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9c717571939f0b653a6412ed81f1b20c"><gtr:id>9c717571939f0b653a6412ed81f1b20c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K502364/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B30DC286-3309-48E2-A15D-BDF547057A33</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drug Formulation &amp; Delivery</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
