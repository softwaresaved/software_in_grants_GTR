It has been argued, for instance, that international law prohibits amnesties for international crimes, forbids engaging people accused of such crimes in peace talks, and outlaws certain power-sharing agreements. Vice versa, it has been suggested that international law determines that some groups must participate in peace talks, that issues such as gender equality must be regulated by a peace agreement and that topics such as human rights violations must be raised in peace talks. These putative 'norms' can have a decisive impact on peace talks: parties may not want to talk peace if they are threatened with prosecution or if they cannot obtain a power-sharing arrangement. Focus on gender and human rights, in turn, may contribute to a blueprint for an ideal state, but turn attention away from issues that are dividing the parties. 
In response to demands from practice, this project aims to clarify the role of international law in peace negotiations in 3 ways. First, it assesses whether the 'norms' suggested by the literature in fact amount to international law. Most of the proposed norms are based on moral philosophy or a review of practice. But these are not sources of international law. This project is the first to examine through an interpretive empirical study whether the putative norms find support in the sources of international law. This will not only advance the discipline of international law, but also assist practising negotiators. 
Secondly, this project aims to clarify the existing scholarship on the 'law' of peacemaking by developing a taxonomy of the various concepts of 'law' that are currently used in this body of literature. This clarity is also important to practising negotiators. If the 'law' of peacemaking is 'law' in the sense of 'model law', then it can be ignored at will. Ignoring binding 'international law', however, can lead to international responsibility. 
Finally, evaluating the empirical findings, the project will explore what drives attempts to govern peacemaking by more international law. In doing so, it will contribute to a literature on possible changes in the sources of international law and to scholarship on the more general phenomenon of legalisation in society. It will also assist those who make international law in the evaluation of proposals towards further legalisation. 
Matching the interdisciplinarity of the project, each of the research objectives will be pursued with a methodology and method that fits the type of question involved. The data-gathering methods will include interviews with key actors in peace negotiations, at headquarters of international organisations (United Nations and African Union) and in situ in three case studies (Sudan, Somalia and Uganda). 
Practitioners, including from the UN and AU, have been consulted in the development of this proposal; will influence the implementation through their role in interviews, the Advisory Group and the Nexus (a week-long mutual knowledge transfer between academics and practitioners) and will be involved in the dissemination. This will guarantee the highest degree of impact. 
In sum, this project can make a fundamental contribution to the future course of proposals on a law of peacemaking; understanding of the interaction between law and peace processes; the literatures on peace and conflict studies and international law; methodologies that integrate normative and empirical research and break boundaries between scholarly and practitioners' knowledge; and, most fundamentally, the increasing practice of peace negotiations.
The project will be supported by a bespoke career development programme with cross-disciplinary mentoring from peace and conflict studies and international law, a study visit and several training courses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research aims to benefit not only (1) academics and (2) students (for (1) and (2), see above under academic beneficiaries), but also (3) the public sector, (4) the third sector and (5) the general public.

In the domestic public sector, the role of international law in peace negotiations is of particular relevance to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development (in particular the Stabilisation Unit). Both are involved in influencing peace negotiations all over the world and consultations have borne out that they have questions about the implications of international law for such processes. 

In the international public sector, the project is of utmost relevance to international organisations involved in peace negotiations. This project is particularly tailored to demands of the United Nations (which has a specialised Mediation Support Unit) and the African Union (which has several Panels that are mediating conflicts). States, too, benefit from enhanced clarity on a 'law' of peacemaking, since it specifies what they can and cannot negotiate. 

In the third sector the beneficiaries are national and international NGOs such as Conciliation Resources, Pax Christi, St Egidio and Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Federation for Human Rights. The first 3 organisations often help preparing the ground for peace negotiations; the last 3 organisations stress the importance of human rights, including in peace agreements. 

Finally, the general public has an interest in peace, and therefore also in any possibly facilitating (or obstructing) role that international law may play. 

These three groups of beneficiaries benefit because:
- Understanding why certain practices in peacemaking occur and to what extent these are required by international law makes it possible for states, international organisations, NGOs and practising negotiators to distinguish between what the law is, what the law could become and what the law is as promoted by activists. Since law could set the parameters for peace talks, an ability to make this distinction enhances the effectiveness of such talks. 

- Insights into status of any law concerning peacemaking and the drivers of the process of the legalisation of peacemaking allow governments, international organisations and NGOs better to assess whether and in what direction to push towards further legalisation of peace processes. In this way, the project contributes towards evidence based law and policy-making, nationally and internationally. 

- Ultimately, by clarifying the relationship between putative norms of international law on peacemaking, and peacemaking processes, this project aims to facilitate such processes, which could improve welfare, social cohesion and security across the globe.

More generally, the public sector, third sector and general public will benefit from this project's development of a method that distils scholarly insights from practitioners' knowledge and makes scholarly insights relevant to practitioners. Application of this method to other fields of research could positively transform the type of scholarly knowledge produced and the application of scholarly knowledge in practice. 

The Pathways to Impact strategy (see below) has been designed so that the project will have an immediate impact. The beneficiaries have been involved in the research project from the conceptualisation phase onwards and will also be involved in its implementation and the dissemination of the findings. 

Finally, the skills that I will develop during this project (in particular, project management, interpretive research methods, public engagement, using data-analysis programs, bridging the academic/practitioner divide and expanding a network of practising negotiators and international lawyers) will be useful in other sectors, too, for instance policy-making.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>248710</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>20000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;
