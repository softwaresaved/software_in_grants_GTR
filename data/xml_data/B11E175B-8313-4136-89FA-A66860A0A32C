&lt;p>The project team is mapping out the position with regard to the two sub-questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What impact does the use of UAVs have on possibilities for containing and/or ending intrastate conflict?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What impact does the use of UAVs within a state?s borders have on the relationship between this state and the intervening state?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>With the two Research Strands, which relate to the perceptions of affected groups regarding the possibilities of achieving a negotiated settlement of local insurgent conflicts and relations between hosting and intervening states.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These have enabled attention to be given to exploring the relationship of counter terrorism policy with counterinsurgency policy with specific regard to UAV functionality involving&amp;nbsp; other dimensions of UAV use, such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, target acquisition and unmanned combat aerial vehicles, namely Predators and Reapers.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Research into how different values, belief systems, narratives, and historical contexts lead to radically different interpretations of whether US/UK drone strikes are increasing or decreasing national and international security is extremely timely and has the potential to benefit non-academic and academic users. By providing a better understanding of how cultural contexts shape perceptions of security among groups affected by drone strikes, this research aims to contribute to the development of policies which empathise with the beliefs, values, and emotions of those who are most affected by drone attacks. 

The focus on how developments in drone technology impact on the propensities for cooperation and conflict, and the implications of this for mitigating and transforming conflicts, will generate impact for the following groups:

Policy-makers; Cabinet Office (especially members of the National Security Council); Members of Parliament; Diplomatic staff (Ministry of Defence, Department of Defence, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, State Department, EU); Development Agencies (Department for International Development, USAID); Military personnel (NATO, British and US Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, EU Military Staff); Charities / NGOs; the general public.

The project team will utilise Knowledge Exchange opportunities, as well as traditional impact generation activities, that will increase understanding of the following areas:

1) Clarification of the relationship between drone strikes and conflict resolution, enabling improved practitioner assessment of situations when the use of this technology is more or less likely to lead to conflict resolution/dialogue between conflict parties.

2) Greater appreciation of how drone strikes affect intrastate and interstate relationships and the variables that impact upon them within the sphere of conflict.

3) Encouraging policy-makers to critically reflect on the appropriateness of the choice of drone strikes in a variety of situations.

4) Providing evidence of the impact of drone strikes on intrastate and interstate relationships and how this calls for new approach to understanding and interpreting this evidence from within a framework of theories of conflict transformation and trust-building.

5) Greater understanding of the cultural contexts and moral universe shaping perceptions of security among groups affected by drone strikes, and the need to develop policies that are empathetic to how drone technology risks becoming a new space for cultural misunderstanding and conflict.

6) Helping practitioners and other stakeholders to think about how trust building and conflict resolution approaches can be effectively mapped into an overarching strategy, and consider how drone strikes may or may not complement the strategic objects and progress towards conflict resolution.

7) Engaging with stakeholders, policy makers and other security professionals to encourage debate regarding the necessity and format of any international regulation on the use of drones at an international level.

8) The project's findings would be factored into the work of the International Committee on Robot Arms Control (ICRAC) and other organisations committed to developing an international regulatory regime for drone warfare.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>229027</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project findings have been disseminated through the pathways to impact set out below.

? The sixth Birmingham Policy Commission examined the security implications for the British Government of Drone technology, both civil and military. The Commission brought together leading academics from the Institute for Conflict, Cooperation and Security at the University of Birmingham with NGO experts and distinguished former public servants. It was chaired by Sir David Omand, former UK Security and Intelligence Coordinator and a former Permanent Secretary of the Home Office and Director of GCHQ. The Commission has taken evidence from a wide range of British, US, and French experts, as well as inviting written submissions from around the world. The Report was launched at the Royal United Services Institute on 22nd October 2014.


? The Report was well-received in the Policy Community and was reported widely in the media. Tom Watson, then Chair of the APPG on UAVs, Admiral Lord West, Martin Caton, Chair of the APPG on weapons and protection of civilians, and Sir David Omand wrote to Philip Hammond, MP, endorsing Commission recommendations on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.

? This was followed by an Early Day Motion, Early Day Motion 487: Proposal for UK Policy on UAV Use. This read as follows: 

? That this House welcomes the Birmingham Policy Commission on The Security Impact of UAVs: Challenges and Opportunities for the UK, chaired by Professor Sir David Omand, which was published on 22 October 2014; notes that the exploitation of UAVs to the UK's benefit is held back by a lack of central direction; stresses the need for policy on the use of UAVs articulating the UK position on application of international human rights and humanitarian law in complex conflicts; calls on the Government to distinguish UK practice, and protect UK personnel, from inadvertent complicity in the targeted killing of suspects outside traditional battlefields by the US; invites the Government to disclose the guidance issued to staff, and safeguards in place, to ensure that shared intelligence cannot be used for targeted killing contrary to UK law; and further calls on the Government to implement these recommendations forthwith.

? In October 2014, Professor Nicholas Wheeler, Professor David Dunn and Professor Stefan Wolff gave a briefing in Brussels on the strategic, legal, ethical, and regulatory dimensions of the UK's use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to a number of high level representatives from NATO, the European Parliament, the International Crisis Group, Airbus, BAE systems and Finmeccanica. A copy of the presentation can be found here.



? In addition to the above, the project Team has recently completed a submission to the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy and one for the Defence Committee on ISIL. Previous submissions have been received with interest. Professors Wheeler and Wolff have also submitted written evidence to the Defence Committee Inquiry: Remote Control: Remotely Piloted Air Systems - current and future UK use (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmdfence/772/772vw01.htm). Part of this written evidence was cited in Paragraphs 130 and 131 of the main report (Vol. 1) and appeared in Recommendation 16 of the Report, being acknowledged also in the Government's response (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmdfence/611/611.pdf ).

? The Institute for Conflict, Co-operation and Security submission, Written Evidence Number 21, dated November 2013, to the House of Commons Defence Committee enquiry was published in on Remote Control: Remotely Piloted Air Systems - Current and Future UK Use, Tenth Report of Session 2013-14, Volume II Written Evidence, 25 March 2014, Ev W124. The Government's response consisted of the following: House of Commons Defence Committee - Remote Control: Remotely Piloted Air Systems - current and future UK use: Government Response to the Committee's Tenth Report of Session 2013-14, Sixth Special Report of Session 2014-15, HC 611, 29 July 2014. There the Government writes, on page 12, that: 'The Government addresses this recommendation in the detailed response to Recommendation 8. We acknowledge the need to carefully review and update laws, particularly around personal privacy, as Unmanned or Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems are more commonly used.' In their response to Recommendation 8, on page 5, the Government stated that: 'The Working Group meets throughout the year' and the 'key issues' of 'Public perception, privacy, data protection' have been 'identified as priorities to be addressed'.

? On 5th November 2014, a letter to Philip Hammond MP calling on the government to consider disclosing the guidance relating the sharing and use of UK intelligence in terms of individuals who are at risk of targeted lethal strikes outside traditional battlefields was co-signed by Sir David Omand. The Policy Commission was referenced in a Parliamentary Early Day Motion tabled on 6th November 2014, which stressed &amp;quot;the need for policy on the use of drones articulating the UK position on application of international human rights and humanitarian law in complex conflicts&amp;quot;. The Policy Commission was quoted in a press release issued by Article 36 on 14 November to coincide with the annual meeting of the UN Convention on Conventional Weapons. The Policy Commission was cited in the tabling of a question for a written answer by the European Parliament regarding steps taken by the High Representative on the issue. On 26 Jan 2015, Lord West of Spithead cited the Policy Commission report for the specific risks it highlighted that &amp;quot;needed to be addressed by legislators such as the use of drones carrying improvised explosive devices&amp;quot; in a debate on Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill in the House of Lords. 

? The Birmingham Policy Commission report was also cited heavily in a recent House of Commons briefing paper, which provided an &amp;quot;overview of military drones used by the UK armed forces&amp;quot;. The Policy Commission was referenced in a Parliamentary Early Day Motion tabled on 18th June 2015, which called on the government to &amp;quot;devise and disclose a distinct and overarching policy on the use of British military drones as part of British defence strategy&amp;quot;. Further details can be found here. The Policy Commission is referenced (endnote 3) in a new POST note on Automation in Military Operations. On 13 October 2015, Dr Andrew Murrison, MP for South West Wiltshire, cited the Birmingham Policy Commission in a House of Commons debate on &amp;quot;Drones in Conflict&amp;quot; regarding the lawfulness of the recent killing of British citizens in Syria by UK drones.

On 9th March 2015, Professor David Dunn and Dr Peter Gray visited BAE Systems Group in Farnborough to discuss the findings of the Policy Commission report. In April 2015, Professor David Dunn presented his analysis of the transatlantic drone debate to an audience of experts on drone warfare from government, the military, academia, industry, and the legal profession from the United States and Europe in Washington D.C. Further details of the conference organised by the Stimson Center and the Heinrich Boell Foundation can be found here. 

? Professor Nicholas Wheeler attended the third meeting of the Drone Communications Cross-Industry Working Group held on 20 May 2015. UoB is currently the only university involved in this group, which also has representations from Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Finmeccanica, Thales, BAE, MoD, Qinetiq, ADS and Boeing. On 29th May, Dr Peter Gray gave a presentation at the Hay Festival on the history of technological innovation in airpower including the development of drones, chaired by Con Coughlin, Defence Editor of The Telegraph.

? The research team on the 'Political Effects of UAVs' project presented their interim findings at a day-long conference at the Royal Aeronautical Society on Friday 12th June attended by academics, policymakers, members of parliament and journalists. 

On 16th June 2015, a delegation from the ICCS, including Professor Nicholas Wheeler, Professor David Dunn and Dr Talat Farooq (Honorary Research Fellow) presented findings from 'The Political Effects of UAVs' to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Drones (APPG) in Westminster. The APPG meeting, the first of the new parliament, was chaired by Baroness Stern. Further details can be found here. 

On 20th October 2015, the ICCS co-hosted an event in Parliament in partnership with the All Party Parliamentary Group on Drones, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Global Security and Non-Proliferation, and the Royal United Services Institute, to review the Birmingham Policy Commission, one year on. 

On 18th November 2015, the Joint Committee on Human Rights published written evidence submitted by Professors David Dunn and Nicholas Wheeler in response to the call issued by the inquiry on the UK Government's policy on the use of drones for targeted killing. On 9th December, the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights took oral evidence from Sir David Omand (Chair of the Birmingham Policy Commission) and Jennifer Gibson (Commissioner)

On 11th December 2015, the ICCS senior research team met with Gisela Stuart

Media Coverage
The launch of the Policy Commission report in October 2014 was widely covered in the national news. 
? It featured on ITV News Online, The Guardian, BBC News Online, Daily Mail Online, The Independent, The Telegraph, The Press Association, The Sun, The Daily Mirror, The Birmingham Post and BBC Radio 4. 
? Professor David H Dunn and Sir David Omand discussed the report on the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2 on Wednesday 19 November, to an audience of over 7m listeners. 
? Professor Nicholas Wheeler was interviewed on BBC Radio Essex about the possible use of drones in everyday life and recorded a podcast with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism on the findings of the Policy Commission report. 
? Professor David Dunn was interviewed by BBC News Online for an article about drones. Professor Dunn stated that the government need to consider licencing drones after an American woman was injured when a drone fell on her. 
? He has also written a piece on the creeping autonomy of lethal weapons for the United Nations Association of the UK magazine. 
? On 13 September, 
? Professor David Dunn was interviewed about UK drone strikes on BBC Stoke (39:30) and BBC West (21:35) 
? Professors David Dunn and Nicholas Wheeler contributed an article to the Birmingham Brief on 22 October 2015, which focused on the legal bases for drones strikes in Syria.


2016 was a successful year for drone-related work at the ICCS. Updating the Impact for 2016 is below on a project basis.
 
The Institute has been awarded a grant from the Gerda Henkel Stiftung on the Nefarious Criminal and Terrorist Uses of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The focus of this research project is to analyse the threat presented by the revolution in easy access to the air presented by the technological development of small and medium sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The research design has its focus on the research question: To what extent does new unmanned technology challenge traditional conceptions of vulnerability and risk? This project is adding real value to this area of academic study, as well as impact t the levels of both policy and practice. The building of databases, interviews and the interactive development of that information is fundamental to the furtherance of knowledge in this field and the instrumentalization of it, in addition to dissemination and ongoing capacity building. There has been substantial intellectual buy in from The West Midlands Police Counter Terrorism Office, the RAF, as well as security agencies. The interim findings from the project have been fed back by those organisations, constituting a strong pathway for ongoing instrumental impact.
 
Towards a new (restraining) global consensus on the use of armed drones is a new project supported by a grant from the Foundation Open Society Institute in cooperation with the Human Rights Initiative of the Open Society Foundations. It aims at securing a new normative consensus that delegitimizes the use of armed drones for targeting killing outside of recognized war zones. Such a consensus does not exist within Europe, between Europe and the United States, nor globally. Professors Wheeler and Dunn have been able to influence strongly the views of All-Party Parliamentary Group on Drones, Open Society Foundations and its partners and the Remote Control Project. With regard to the latter, Professors Wheeler and Schulte and Dr Chris Wyatt contributed comments and revisions to the Remote Control Project's report on secret warfare in an information age. The Institute is contributing strongly to the debate and is developing proven conceptual and instrumental impact based on solid evidence, based research. Earlier in the year, on 27 April 2016, the UAV project team at the University of Birmingham met with Emily Knowles, Manager of the Remote Control Project at the Oxford Research Group.
 
The University in general and ICCS in particular has a strong relationship with DSTL and Dr Chris Wyatt is liaising with them on the themes of maritime, Third Offset and deterrence. Dr Wyatt and Professor Schulte both attended the DSTL consultation meeting on deterrence at Lancaster University in February 2017. DTSL representatives at the meeting took extensive notes and can provide written evidence of the importance of those contributions. The activity is synergistically impactful.
 
In addition to the above. Professor Wheeler gave a presentation on drones at a Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research 'Science and Security Policy Workshop: Governance, Ethics and the Law' at the British Academy in London on 1 March 2016. He shared the session with Professor Anthony Gillespie, who was one of the authors of the DCDC Joint Doctrine Note on the British Government's use of drones in 2011. The workshop explored the ethical &amp;amp; legal challenges facing policy-makers &amp;amp; practitioners working in the defence &amp;amp; security sectors as they manage the development &amp;amp; application of new technological capabilities, part of which related to drones. A PaCCS (Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research, and connected to the Research Councils and DSTL) Policy Briefing Note based on discussions, was published later in 2016. It was entitled The governance of unmanned aerial vehicles in defence and security and was authored by PaCCS External Champion, Dr Tristram Riley-Smith. Impact: Instrumental.
 
On 19 January 2016, the representatives from the Birmingham Policy Commission visited RAF Waddington, constituting a pathway to instrumental impact</gtr:description><gtr:id>5D7B8D2F-A25A-4410-88B2-A21E265F666E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research reveals that the effect of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs and more commonly known as drones) on conflict resolution functions differently across the three case studies as set out below.

The key finding in the case of Afghanistan is that drone strikes in isolation have had a limited effect on insurgent activity in Afghanistan, and an equally limited impact on conflict resolution. Within Afghanistan, drones are a subset of wider military forces and have not been found to be more unpopular with the civilian population than other tactics, such as night raids, or methods used by the Taliban, such as IEDs. 

The key finding in the case of Pakistan is that the dominant narrative that strikes by UAVs are preventing peace negotiations is overly simplistic and inflated within the country for political purposes. Counter to claims made in some parts of the press, the majority of those interviewed for the project expressed the opinion that strikes by UAVs had killed more terrorists than civilians. Nevertheless, the project shows that civilian deaths from drone use has adversely affected the potential for conflict resolution. 

The key finding in the case of Yemen is that strikes by drones have resulted in some unintended consequences - otherwise known as 'blowback'. However, our research shows that blowback from drone strikes in Yemen has been overemphasised in relation to its effect upon the potential for conflict resolution. Cases of purposeful retaliation are relatively few in the context of violence in Yemen more generally. Civilian casualties and targeting of lower-level or part-time militants have motivated family members and tribal affiliates of those killed to support and, less commonly, join AQAP. However, this phenomenon has not had the level of impact on conflict resolution in Yemen suggested by the existing literature.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will be taken forward through two key paths:

Academic:
The project team are writing up the findings of the project in 2 major refereed journal articles. These will be completed by the end of the summer 2017.

Two members of the project team (Wheeler and Dunn) have been awarded a new 18 month research grant by the Open Society Foundation to investigate the possibilities for a new transatlantic consensus on the use of armed drones. 

Non-academic
It is expected that the outcomes of the research will be taken up by key partners and stakeholders involved in formulating policy and strategy in relation to the use of armed drones in interventionary contexts. These research opportunities will be faciliated through the following avenues of user engagement:

Briefings
Confidential briefings with key users and stakeholders in the UK and US where the findings of the project will be discussed and the implications of these for allied policy on drones at both the strategic, operational, and tactical levels assessed.

Continuing engagement with key stakeholders (e.g. the APPG on drones, Drone Communications Group, industry partners etc.) and the use of the ICCS web pages and op-ed pieces such as 'The Birmingham Briefs' and podcasts/vidcasts (the webpage is updated regularly by all involved, detailing research progress.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BD4A078F-65E9-42A3-A8FA-EC91272B7B69</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/government-society/centres/iccs/research/unmanned-aerial-vehicles/index.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/772E3B0F-B514-4DCB-8637-5BE090B8230B"><gtr:id>772E3B0F-B514-4DCB-8637-5BE090B8230B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Drones: disembodied aerial warfare and the unarticulated threat</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Affairs</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4f9e4f53862cdf4e238b194fc41dbcb2"><gtr:id>4f9e4f53862cdf4e238b194fc41dbcb2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>DUNN D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/06406504-C4A8-4D8D-B2BB-678C89BD5EB3"><gtr:id>06406504-C4A8-4D8D-B2BB-678C89BD5EB3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Drone Use in Counter-Insurgency and Counter-Terrorism: Policy or Policy Component?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c48dd5ca91b5a5038f3e245e9a8f1cf8"><gtr:id>c48dd5ca91b5a5038f3e245e9a8f1cf8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dunn, D.H.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/81730112-69AA-41FC-AFCA-86BA3EFF0D1F"><gtr:id>81730112-69AA-41FC-AFCA-86BA3EFF0D1F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Security Impact of Drones: Challenges and Opportunities for the UK</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a4b6fba3691bff62bca1bd53c9592a96"><gtr:id>a4b6fba3691bff62bca1bd53c9592a96</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Birmingham Policy Commission - academic lead Wheeler, N.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K011359/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AB8E72DD-E988-47DA-B01A-BE9012CC89A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conflict/War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A153974-B803-439F-95AD-724028C45340</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Security Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
