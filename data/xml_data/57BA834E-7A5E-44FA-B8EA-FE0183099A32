The principal elements involve:

* interviews with key informants working in space science in different capacities to gain perspectives on key areas of space science that may influence students' responses to STEM subjects, and advice on space science resources that have been (or will be) produced for use with school students; 
* the design of a new instrument to assess school students' attitudes to STEM subjects and to space science (no single instrument probing attitudes to STEM subjects currently exists);
* use of the instrument to gather longitudinal data from pupils aged 8-11 (Key Stage 2) and 11-14 (Key Stage 3) from a sample of 30 primary and 30 secondary schools;
* interviews with teachers and students in 25% of these schools to gather data on their views of factors that influence engagement and participation in STEM subject, including the effects of human space flight; 
* the production of an overview (or map) of space science resources aimed at engaging young people in STEM subjects; the map will include existing resources and any resources specifically linked to Tim Peake's mission.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The precise nature of the project outputs will be determined in consultation with the UK Space Agency and ESRC. The work will be of interest to a number of groups, particularly if Tim Peake's mission does stimulated interest in STEM subjects. These groups would include policy makers, providers of science enrichment, engagement and widening participation activities, teachers, and those undertaking research into students' attitudes, uptake and engagement in STEM subjects.

The planned outputs for the project are likely to include:
* detailed interim and final project reports, as agreed with the UK Space Agency and ESRC
* a summary reports for staff in schools, including head teachers, teachers and governors, and staff in universities and other locations who provide widening participation activities focusing on aspects of space science
* a validated instrument for collecting data on students' attitude, uptake and engagement in STEM subjects, with a separate strand on space science and the societal usefulness of space
* a map of activities used developed to stimulate students' interest in space science
* academic research publications

To ensure the project has maximum impact, the outcomes will be disseminated through the professional networks of the funders and the University of York, and through conference presentations and journal publications. Practitioner awareness of the outcomes will be promoted through networks and organisations including the York-based National Science Learning Centre, the National Network of Science Learning Centres, and UK-ESERO.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>344285</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to teachers at Association for Science Education conference, January 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CBE2481F-437B-4BD8-A7A5-D4955188AD72</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk focused on students' attitudes to STEM (Science Technology Engineering, Mathematics) subjects and changes pre and post Tim Peake's mission to the International Space Station.

1. This report covers the baseline data collected for the RISES (Research Into Spaceflight and Engagement with STEM) project, which explores the impact of human spaceflight on young people's responses to STEM subjects. The project is linked to the Principia mission in which the astronaut Tim Peake visits the International Space Station.

Methods

2. The project adopts a mixed methods approach, gathering quantitative data through the use of an attitude survey with students, and qualitative data through interviews with key informants, students and teachers. Additional quantitative data from the National Pupil Database (NPD) allow for the characterisation of schools participating in the project. 

3. Data collection is taking place at three points: baseline data prior to Tim Peake's mission to the International Space Station in November 2015, immediate follow-up data during the mission (first part of 2016), and longer-term follow-up data approximately one year later (mid-2017). 

4. The participating groups of students are upper primary age students (age 8-11) and lower secondary age students (age 11-14), aged 8 and 11 at the start of the project.

5. A map of resources linked to the Principia Mission is being developed as part of the project.

Progress to date
 
6. A dedicated on-line survey to assess students' affective responses to STEM subjects has been developed for the project. The survey includes a section on space science.

7. Ten key informants have been interviewed.

8. Baseline survey data have been collected from 23 primary schools and 18 secondary schools, with a sample size of 797 primary age students and 1600 secondary age students.

9. Interviews have been conducted at 17 case study schools, nine primary schools and eight secondary schools.

10. The key informant interviews have been analysed.

11. The fixed-response items in the on-line survey have been analysed.

12. Further analysis is required for the open-response items on the on-line survey, and for the interviews with teachers and students in the case study schools.

13. A database of resources is being compiled as an on-going aspect of the project

Findings

14. Most key informants are positive about the potential of the Principia mission and Tim Peake's work to improve young people's attitudes to STEM subjects and to space. Space was seen as a very useful context in which knowledge and understanding of STEM subjects could be developed, and also a good means of promoting awareness of a range of careers in STEM. There were aspirations for space science to serve as a way of attracting young people from traditionally-underrepresented backgrounds into STEM careers more generally. 

15. Overall, both primary and secondary students are positive about the value of STEM subjects, and about space. They believe science makes an important contribution to people's lives, and technology and engineering can also help improve things. Their views of the contribution of mathematics are less positive.

16. Students' confidence about their abilities in science and maths is about the same in the primary and secondary age ranges. They are less confident about their abilities in engineering, which was explored in the secondary school survey only. This may well be explained by their lack of confidence about what the subject entails, as there have no dedicated engineering lessons.

17. More secondary students than primary students believe they will need to use science, technology and, especially, maths in their jobs.
 
18. There is a downward trend from primary to secondary age groups in relation to considering careers in STEM subjects, particularly for maths, with around half of secondary school students seeming already not considering careers involving those subjects. Views of careers involving technology are more positive. 

19. Space science is viewed very positively and seen as making a worthwhile contribution to people's lives, with the majority of both primary and secondary age students believing that space science makes lives on Earth better. There was also support for sending people into space to find out more about the universe, and that this activity was worth the money spent on it.

20. Whilst the National Curriculum for England does not have a requirement for teaching about space, some teachers bring space-related activity into their lessons. Students in some schools were already aware of Tim Peake and his mission at the time of the baseline survey. Students were able to report on a range of space-related matters they had learned about in the last year.

21. There is a belief that you need to be clever to do a job in space science or technology, even more so than the need to be clever to do maths and science. 

22. Space is a topic of significant interest to students, both in school and outside school. The positive responses are particularly pronounced in the primary age group.

23. Primary students believe more strongly than secondary students that they have the ability to attain a job in space science.

24. Students are very positive about the possibility of them travelling to space, though less interested in careers involving space science. Boys are particular positive about travelling to space, with the divide between boys and girls more pronounced in the secondary age group.

25. Some confusion about STEM-related clubs in schools emerged, particularly in secondary schools, and linked to the use of the word 'club' for remedial or additional support classes. Where STEM-related clubs did exist in the form of an 'extra' for interested students, they covered a variety of topics including environmental matters, health matters, additional practical activities to those undertaken in lessons, computer programing and space/astronomy clubs.

26. Primary age students are much more positive about participation their schools' STEM-related clubs, with enthusiasm being highest for space/astronomy clubs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Could be used to inform policy decisions about the extent to which space science should appear in the school science curriculum.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CCEF125A-05A1-415D-8EEA-BB209286422F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database of resources to support the teaching of space science including resources developed specifically for the Principia mission</gtr:description><gtr:id>88836F4C-CB92-4C2B-B637-7F05C407D8E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet - the database is being compiled over the three-year duration of the project,, which is currently at the end of the first year.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Database of resources to support the teaching of space science</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The research instrument was refined in the light of the first round of data collection.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7BDD6AC0-A9F4-4CB5-8359-94FB901D9C3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There has been interest from teachers and other academics in an instrument to assess attitudes to STEM subjects.
