The film follows two women residents of the Myatts Field North council estate in the London Borough of Lambeth as they are forced to move out of their homes as part of a regeneration scheme. In terms of the genesis of the film, I approached a filmmaker through a mutual contact to make a documentary based on my research into public housing regeneration under the Private Finance Initiative. The director, Ross Domoney, was due to make a film as part of his degree as a student at the National Film and Television School. I provided a background research report and introductions to residents on the estate. Ross and his student team then began to collect film footage during the summer of 2015 and we liaised closely at this time. I provided advice and guidance on the filming period, but the final cut of the film was the responsibility of the student team.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4BDF94BD-9EC3-4FC7-92A8-A571D9289905</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film has been shown at a number of film festivals and individual screenings in the UK - London, Sheffield, Leeds, Portsmouth, Edinburgh - and internationally, including the United States and Greece.

It has also been used often as part of political meetings, academic conferences and educational events with the film combined with talks by the director, residents and myself. It has a notable impact when screened at film festivals in London with residents being asked for follow-up interviews with the media. It has also had an important educational impact with academics using it as part of their teaching awards.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Uprooted</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/166171144</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Centre for Investigative Journalism</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ESRC White Rose DTC Collaborative Studentship Award on PFI and Information Rights</gtr:description><gtr:id>9EDE985B-CA87-4376-B1EC-CEEB5D9F8C55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration has already helped to generate a public conference on the Private Finance Initiative which was held on 1 November 2014 - see www.peoplevspfi.org.uk</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Centre for Investigative Journalism has agreed to contribute &amp;pound;2000 a year to a PhD student on this topic</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A key outcome of the research has been an emerging collaboration with a third sector organisation called The Centre for Investigative Journalism (http://www.tcij.org/) that has now resulted in a 3 year PhD collaborative studentship funded by the ESRC White Rose Doctoral Training Centre (October 2014 to September 2017). The PhD is will be supervised by Dr Stuart Hodkinson and Dr Robert Vanderbeck in the School of Geography, University of Leeds. The Centre for Investigative Journalism is a UK-based charity that champions critical, in-depth reporting and the defence of the public interest. It came into being in 2003 to address a deepening crisis in investigative reporting. During the ESRC Public Housing Regeneration research project, some residents living in PFI regeneration areas have attempted to find out more about the contractual and financial agreements that their local authority landlords have entered into with private sector consortia using the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and the Audit Commission Act 1998. These efforts have been, more often than not, frustrated by local authorities refusing to disclose some or all of the requested information. This experience led to a collaborative relationship beginning between the PI (Hodkinson), and Lucas Amin and Sid Ryan who were then working for The Request Initiative (http://requestinitiative.org/), a Community Interest Company that uses information law in the public interest on behalf of NGOs and charities. They were interested in exploring the limits and potential of UK information laws to open up the Private Finance Initiative and outsourced public services in general to greater democratic control and public accountability. Eventually, both collaborators left Request and the collaboration was continued with Sid Ryan when he joined the Centre for Investigative Journalism. The collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism will produce a systemic review of public access to information in PFI projects, test the adequacy of existing public accountability mechanisms in PFI schemes and develop proposals for new or amended policies and legislation to enhance democratic oversight to the privatised public sector.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>presentation of initial research findings on refurbishment (Lambeth) June 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7F88C056-1A04-4FE9-89F4-89BA905A1DD3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 8 June 2013 we presented interim findings of a survey of residents whose homes had been refurbished under PFI that we had co-produced with the Myatts Field North Residents Association and PFI Monitoring Board.

The first and most significant impact has been the development of a methodology for residents to effectively monitor the delivery of public housing regeneration under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). During the early stages of the research project, it was apparent that many residents' experiences of 'regeneration' under PFI were poor and unsatisfactory. Residents wanted to better understand the PFI model in order to effectively challenge and improve their situations. In response, we worked with local community activists in different PFI schemes to develop a participatory action research methodology to independently monitor the performance of the PFI contractor and use the evidence generated to seek improvements and more just outcomes. This multi-stage process began with the research team running a series of popular education-style events with residents to share experiences and understandings of the PFI regeneration model and the specifics of each PFI scheme. Residents were then trained and supported in using statutory public information rights such as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Audit Commission Act 1998 to unlock key contract documents and financial data and legally challenge non-disclosure. This information was then analysed and simplified to allow residents to prioritise key contractual promises and obligations they wanted to monitor for compliance. From these priorities we co-designed and carried out with residents a series of human and visual surveys that uncovered evidence of poor quality works and services. The participatory action research process generated a large number of resident complaints and service improvement requests. The resulting findings were written up in reports and sent to the relevant local authorities and other stakeholders including the Health and Safety Executive who in one case acted upon the evidence and suggested workplace improvements by the PFI contractor. Residents used the evidence in their local campaigning work, including holding several demonstrations, petitioning the local authority, giving evidence to scrutiny committees and getting coverage for their situation in a series of local and national media articles. One local authority subsequently investigated these complaints, replicating our survey design. We also helped individual residents by providing background reports to their lawyers. Overall, the research has contributed to increasing the short-term effectiveness of public service delivery in one housing PFI scheme, and improving resident involvement and empowerment in several housing PFI regeneration schemes. As a result we are currently working with residents groups in other regeneration areas and have been invited to give evidence to one local authority's scrutiny inquiry on improving resident involvement in housing management and regeneration. Since February 2017, the research findings are being used by the campaign group, Fuel Poverty Action, and residents of one of the housing estates in the research to lobby the energy company, E.ON, for improvements to their district heating service.

A second major impact has seen the research findings inform the development of a new national campaign network focused on PFI. The People Versus the Private Finance Initiative aims to pressure the government and public bodies to renegotiate, buy-out or terminate PFI contracts on public interest grounds. This research on housing PFI informed the development of the campaign network and was disseminated at the launch conference in November 2014 to over 200 people from across the UK and other countries. Attendees also received a specialist training workshop on monitoring PFI contracts based on the resident-led methodology developed during the research. The campaign has helped to put a fresh spotlight on the socially unjust outcomes of public services being provided under PFI contracts. 

The third main impact has seen the research findings and expertise being used by the media in a range of formats and engagements to develop accessible journalistic accounts and explanations of housing PFI regeneration for advancing public understanding. For example, the research featured in a high-profile story in the leading building magazine, Construction News; it is has inspired and informed an ongoing investigation by the Guardian newspaper; it is the subject of a documentary film about homeloss in regeneration schemes called Uprooted that has been screened across the country and I have given talks at screenings; and it has led to a three-year collaborative PhD project with The Centre for Investigative Journalism (http://www.tcij.org/) exploring the limits and potential of UK information laws to subject outsourced public services to democratic accountability.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C743B7DB-C436-4050-B046-227C3B845AD1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research has led to four main outcomes: 

1. It has generated the following new findings about the experience of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) in delivering public housing regeneration in England since 1998:

1.1. the use of PFI in public housing was driven by the previous Labour Government as part of a wider policy agenda to de-municipalise social housing provision and part-privatise the delivery and management of public service infrastructure;

1.2. to benefit from government subsidies to part-finance housing PFI schemes, local authorities have had to follow top-down policy and financial frameworks that tend to produce a gentrification-based form of socio-spatial restructuring of public housing estates;

1.3. a marked North-South divide in PFI regeneration has emerged after the 2008 financial crisis with the intensification of private market development for in-coming middle class residents in London estates contrasted with the temporary removal of private housing plans in several northern estates;

1.4. residents' daily lives under housing PFI schemes are often characterised by increased levels of complexity, frustration, uncertainty, and inconvenience at the hands of a complex chain of private sub-contractors whose performance is not adequately monitored by either the PFI consortia or local authorities;
 
1.5. many residents have experienced different forms of dispossession and the erosion of their legal and democratic rights because of PFI's highly financialised model of public service delivery that offers limited opportunities for genuine participation in housing management and brings with it an unprecedented degree of commercial confidentiality that prevents residents from effectively holding their public sector landlord to account; 

1.6. residents' poor experiences of PFI contracts has also acted in some areas as an incentive for a revival of community action and empowerment, often in the form of direct opposition to the public and private bodies involved. 

2. The research has developed a new participatory action research methodology for academics and service users to engage in effective PFI contract compliance monitoring that involves:

- uncovering existing local knowledges, skills and understandings;
- helping residents to use their statutory information rights to access the PFI contract;
- prioritising key contractual promises residents want to monitor for compliance; 
- surveying residents to ascertain actual regeneration experiences versus officially-declared performance levels;
- investigating and challenging unwarranted payments made to the PFI contractors. 

3. New collaborations have resulted from the research including: 

- a 3-year PhD project, ESRC-funded, in collaboration with a third sector organisation, The Centre for Investigative Journalism (http://www.tcij.org/), exploring the limits and potential of UK information laws to re-democratise outsourced public services; 

- the launch in November 2014 of a national advocacy network called The People Versus PFI (www.peoplevspfi.org.uk) that supports communities with PFI contracts and campaigns for an end to PFI. 

4. The research has identified new questions and challenges about the implications of PFI for democratic control of public services and spending. These focus on the capacity of public authorities and service users to hold PFI companies and contracts to account, and more broadly to renegotiate and even terminate PFI schemes in the public interest.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings can contribute to informing existing academic and policy debates as well as public understandings about PFI, both specific to housing and more generally across the public sector; and could also be used to significantly improve the existing use of PFI in public housing and to empower residents seeking to shape and influence such schemes. Academics will be able to access the findings through journal articles, a book and conference presentations. Residents will be engaged through the publication of a practical step-by-step guide on how to understand PFI, its effects on their homes, communities, built environments and services, and how they can intervene more effectively in the process to influence, shape and challenge it if necessary. Policy communities will initially be engaged through a short briefing report, followed by an application to the ESRC for a Knowledge Exchange Opportunities grant to bring together key stakeholders and experts with the aim of sharing the findings for the purpose of developing new policy and legal mechanisms that can hold PFI companies and contracts to account, and boost the ability of the public sector more broadly to renegotiate and even terminate PFI schemes in the public interest.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B800AE2A-B86E-4B1D-A561-678360101623</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.housingpfi.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The database is an excel file that contains data collected on all housing PFI schemes in England.
