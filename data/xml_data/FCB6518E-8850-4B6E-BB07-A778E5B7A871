&lt;p>The Strategic Governance of Science and Technology Pathways to Security aims to assist the design and implementation of effective government security policy by improving our understanding of how the pathways and trajectories taken by science and technology shape, and are shaped by, these changing discourses on security. Investigating the ?direction? as well as the ?rate? of technical change, the interdisciplinary research sees innovation in non-linear terms, recognising diverse counterfactual options that are neglected as socio-technical systems become ?locked-in? to possibly undesirable configurations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The programme aims to understand which discursive pathways of security are being realised in technological innovation and infrastructure and to identify options to diversify and improve public policy, technology and practices. This will be done through&amp;nbsp; a series of case studies about the way in which different technological pathways relate to different security discourses. These include Neuroscience, Advanced Robotics, Social Media, Geoengineering, Bioinformatics, and IED technologies. Methodologically, the research incorporates ESRC-STEPS ?pathways? approaches, scientometric mapping, and ?Q-method? techniques, with inbuilt outreach and dissemination strategies.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of this research will be the international community involved in developing, implementing and enforcing governance measures for assessing and addressing the opportunities and threats that emerge from developments in science and technology. This community includes:

1) The UK Government which has historically taken a leading role in this policy area. In a previous pilot project we understood a user-needs analysis which highlighted how the UK and other Governments suffer from a lack of data that is regarded as objective, independent and legitimate by the different actors who need to be involved in policy making. The project will provide them with policy-friendly information on experts' perceptions of current and future threats and opportunities and areas of concern, perceptions of the various policy options that are available, and the social distribution of their strengths and weaknesses across different actors and framings. The project can exploit a coproduction research design that uses the development of simply presented user-focused research outputs, that directly address user needs, to both access more academic data and to build and nurture networks of expertise. These networks will then be used to both disseminate research to users outside academia, and provide future external advice for the UK government. Policy makers will be able to draw on these network of expertise as new threats and opportunities emerge, in line with the recommendations of the Blacklett report.

2) Other Governments working in this area.

3) We will continue to work closely with International Organisations, NGOs and civil society groups, building on our prior research in this area. These groups, such as the Royal Society and WHO, now play key roles in the formation and support of the distributed governance measures for science and technology. The research team has a long history of close engagement with this community, and they will be engaged throughout the project to ensure it addresses their most pressing problems.

4) Industry is a new security actor that plays a key role in ensuring the benefits of technical change can be realised. They have been poorly served by policy research in this area in the past. Because industry is a major user of the technologies concerned, (for example, synthetic biology and neuroscience for the development of pharmaceuticals, or advanced robotics for civilian unmanned aerospace), it has the potential to be adversely influenced by poorly designed public policy. While industry is involved in influencing government policy, it has limited engagement with alternative framings of security and different views on the potential costs and benefits of particular technology developments. By providing industry with a broader understanding of the direction of technical change, our aim is to open up and better engage industrial actors.

5) Civil society both in the UK and internationally will also be supported by this research as part of a long standing and widespread series of outreach activities that we have undertaken to embed social science research within the community.

For all these groups our impact plan proposes to help close the loop between research and practice through continued close interaction with wider research-user communities. The use of the co-production research method, that generates simple, policy focused outputs for users, and uses the process of research to access information to address academic questions, provides an independent, socially robust way of generating information on actors' perceptions and preferences. For all the actors involved this can be used to position themselves in networks, and to position their perceptions and experiences in relation to other actors. The policy-focused outputs can therefore act as 'boundary objects' allowing different social groups to interact, and build connections and position themselves within dynamic policy networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>235039</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Academy of Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Project officer worked with the US National Academies in the preparation of a workshop report on understanding pathogenicity and the Biological Weapons Convention</gtr:description><gtr:id>77E3504B-490F-414C-B8C7-CAAF1B775688</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A National Academies workshop report co-authored by Revill will be published in December 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Contributions made by your partners to this collaboration or partnership consisted of knowledge exchange in this informal collaborative activity and staff development through exposing more junior staff to policy discussions at the interface between science and security.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Revill acted as Rapporteur for an international workshop on understanding pathogencity and its relationship to the Biological Weapons Convention which was hosted by the US National Academies.

The presentation included a section on the changing nature of science since VEREX and drew attention to, inter alia, how States Parties are now faced with: 
New actors engaged in biology, including those from outside the traditional community of practice; New practices, such as the use of fully disposable bio-manufacturing processes, that can perhaps make non-compliance harder to detect; and New knowledge and means of access to information that could be employed to facilitate bio-weaponeering. But also new or improved technologies of detection and surveillance; the emergence of bioforensics and new knowledge and experience from past programs, which could be employed to inform evaluations of non compliance. 


Several participants asked for further information and aspects of the presentation are identifiable in the Wilton park report which has emerged from this meeting.

In addition we have further impact activities planned for example Revill is planning to present his work on IEDs at an IED Experts Meeting of the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices as amended on 3 May 1996 (Amended Protocol II).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DF4990DA-ED7D-492B-8318-BC912E9591FA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has developed the idea of competing 'security cultures' to describe specific combinations of objectives (national or human security, for example) and practices (such as people, organisations, tools, forms of communications) and explored the relationship between such security cultures and key technologies with implications for security. Four such cultures have been identified: first, Geo-Politics' represents the continuation of Cold War thinking in relation to security and has as its objective national security, and the deployment of regular military forces so as to deter a future war against a peer competitor. Second, the concept of New Wars includes practices such as terrorism, insurgencies and sectarian conflict. Third, yet linked with New Wars, is the notion of a War on Terror, which has the objective of using military forces to deal with terrorism and a set of practices that involve intelligence agencies, private security contractors, drones and surveillance. Fourth, is the concept of Liberal Peace, something embodied in multilateral peacekeeping initiatives and humanitarian intervention. Each of these cultures is associated with a specific form of technological change; thus geo-politics is associated with baroque technological change, while new wars are characterised by what we are calling vernacular technological change. 

This multiple framing of cultures of security provides a useful lens with which to make sense of the implications of security relevant technologies and explore the different relationships that specific cultures have formed with different technologies. For example IEDs can be considered the paradigmatic weapon of New Wars. Such weapons are typically, although not exclusively, 'vernacular' technologies in the sense that New Wars actors opt for the simplest possible route to functional, effective IED development based on the available resources at their disposal. Drones, in contrast, can perhaps be regarded as the paradigmatic weapon of the War on Terror and we argue their use has the potential to generate self-perpetuating conflicts that reinforce the security culture associated with the War on Terror. Studies of the role of social media relating to Syrian human rights activism, Colombian police and reporting on the chemical attacks in al Ghouta show that its impact is profoundly ambiguous. On the one hand, it facilitates the work of human rights groups in documenting human rights abuses; on the other hand it offers easier routes for abusive governments to identify dissidents and promulgate disinformation. Finally studies of CBW suggest that the emergence of new wars and the War on Terror may increase the perceived utility of some CBW technologies, and could thereby undermine the taboo on the use of these technologies institutionalised in the Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions.

Beyond the case study specific findings the project raises important new research questions over the continued suitability of current approaches to the procurement of military technology in a dynamic and complex world in which security is disparately conceptualised. It argues that many existing approaches result from a) lock-in to outmoded assumptions as to the nature of security and insecurity which remain unduly influenced by the hangover of geopolitical Cold War thinking and b) related to the above procurement approaches which result in heavy investment in sophisticated technological systems which are ill-suited to addressing contemporary security challenges and asymmetrical conflicts thereby leaving an operational gap in the UK's security.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Several of the specific findings, conclusions and recommendations from case studies could be taken forward and the process of co-production of knowledge and interaction with policy makers and governmental experts has already led to fruitful discussions on how such findings could be advanced by academics or government agencies following these issues. In terms of case study specific findings, the CBW case study has opened up a rich vein of scholarship related to the concept of 'utilities' of CBW for different security cultures that could be taken further forward by academic researchers. The case study on IEDs, has already generated discussion on the use of methods of technological forecasting to anticipate radical innovations in IEDs something that could be explored further by experts in several fields. The social media case studies provide a pioneering and robust exploration of the way different security cultures have exploited social media and raises profound questions variously over the role of social media in building accountability and narrative construction and reconstruction. The generic findings provide a fertile ground for further exploration by academics and policy-makers. For academics working on security but also business and public management, the research paves the way for a critical and interdisciplinary assessment of military procurement models and the deconstruction of assumptions underpinning conventional thinking around security. These research outcomes will be taken forward further upon the publication of the project findings in lay summaries produced in national newspapers and the three books that have emerged from this project and are currently being finalised.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B57F3F1D-B12A-4749-AB2E-0FC53F5EFB1E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>As part of the case study on the use of social media in Colombia, Rieken asked participants in the Colombia police cadet training college to carry a SenseCam for three days, an method which provided thousands of images documenting continuously participant's behaviour.
