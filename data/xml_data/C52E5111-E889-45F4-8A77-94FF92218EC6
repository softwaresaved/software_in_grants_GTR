Recent studies of people with AD suggest that people who are bilingual develop symptoms several years later than people who are monolingual. However previous studies have left open the possibility that this effect may be due to other differences between the two groups.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study aims to establish whether this delayed onset effect is robust by comparing bilinguals and monolinguals drawn from a population which is otherwise similar in social and cultural terms. It is also important to understand why this delayed onset effect arises. In general people who are bilingual tend to outperform monolinguals in capacities such as planning or switching between different tasks. These capacities are called 'executive functions'. Executive functions become impaired in age-related conditions such as AD and Parkinson's Disease (PD). &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study aims to find out if people who are bilingual are more resilient in the face of impairments in executive functions when they develop these disorders. This will be done by comparing the performance of bilingual and monolingual healthy older people, people with AD, and people with PD on tests of executive function. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>501108</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BANC Guardian/Observer Letter</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>695DC1D3-2C1B-4E6D-936A-FA7C5C299C2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We responded to a newspaper article that presented a one-sided view on the the benefits of bilingualism which ran counter to our and much of the extant literature.

Some recent studies have found that being bilingual can help to strengthen mental fitness, protect against age-related decline in mental fitness, and delay the onset of age-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is thought to be because being bilingual helps strengthen certain mental abilities, called 'executive functions'. However, other studies have found that being bilingual does not confer any advantage in mental fitness. When we began this study there was no evidence available about the effects of bilingualism for older Welsh speakers.
? In the BANC study we examined how much of a protective factor being bilingual is for Welsh-speaking older people, including healthy older people, people with early-stage AD, and people with Parkinson's disease (PD). We did this by comparing executive function in monolingual English speakers and bilingual Welsh/English speakers within each of these three groups. In the AD group we also examined the age at which people were diagnosed with dementia.
? For healthy older people, being bilingual did not result in better performance on executive function tasks. There were either no differences between bilinguals and monolinguals, or a tendency for monolinguals to perform better.
? For people with AD, being bilingual did not result in better performance on executive function tasks. Bilinguals were diagnosed with AD on average three years later than monolinguals, although this difference was not statistically significant. The bilinguals were also more impaired than the monolinguals at the time when they were diagnosed, suggesting that they may have sought help at a later stage rather than developing the condition later. However, it was difficult to identify bilinguals with AD through NHS clinics, and the number of bilinguals participating in the study was relatively small, so we cannot draw firm conclusions from these results.
? For people with PD, being bilingual did not result in better performance on executive function tasks.
? The results do not support the view that being a bilingual Welsh/English speaker helps to protect against age-related decline in mental fitness, or that it helps to maintain executive function abilities in the presence of either AD or PD. 
? The results are inconclusive with regard to the possibility that Welsh/English bilinguals develop AD significantly later than monolinguals. If there is a delay in onset, it appears to be much smaller than that identified in some other populations.
? The observation that bilingual Welsh speakers who develop AD come to the attention of services later than monolinguals has implications for provision of clinical services to this group.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The finding that being bilingual did not confer specific benefits for older Welsh speakers could potentially contribute to policy decisions about bilingualism, although realistically as policy-makers in Wales are prioritising the Welsh language this seems unlikely. The finding that older Welsh speakers (bilinguals) were diagnosed with dementia later in the course of the disease than monolingual English speakers might be used by health service providers as a basis for actions to improve equal access to services.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BD18F6E5-05F6-435D-A667-98A1C21CDD2F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofpsychology/reach/documents/BANC_summary.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DED79DC3-3ED2-4814-81AD-BB0E5DD3BCC4"><gtr:id>DED79DC3-3ED2-4814-81AD-BB0E5DD3BCC4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gweld y Gair: standardisation and clinical application of a Welsh language measure for estimation of premorbid intellectual functioning</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychology of Older People: The FPOP Bulletin</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b1c2a7734c9dc3cce0943a1787251478"><gtr:id>b1c2a7734c9dc3cce0943a1787251478</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clare L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/383F19C3-1C6B-4F7F-BD1F-E69508D585E3"><gtr:id>383F19C3-1C6B-4F7F-BD1F-E69508D585E3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Executive control in older Welsh monolinguals and bilinguals</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Cognitive Psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ee2da05b3e73c2b07c1f2593a72c12cf"><gtr:id>ee2da05b3e73c2b07c1f2593a72c12cf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clare, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/53F65A72-D8E0-4280-A00B-B0A27564C583"><gtr:id>53F65A72-D8E0-4280-A00B-B0A27564C583</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effects of lifelong cognitive lifestyle on executive function in older people with Parkinson's disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International journal of geriatric psychiatry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/90e65cba6627e4797ac896340a44b100"><gtr:id>90e65cba6627e4797ac896340a44b100</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hindle JV</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0885-6230</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C1C709CC-35A6-4FA7-9DCD-FADBA75FF15A"><gtr:id>C1C709CC-35A6-4FA7-9DCD-FADBA75FF15A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cognitive reserve in Parkinson's disease: the effects of welsh-english bilingualism on executive function.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Parkinson's disease</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/90e65cba6627e4797ac896340a44b100"><gtr:id>90e65cba6627e4797ac896340a44b100</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hindle JV</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2042-0080</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2154E7D2-5D67-4D51-B566-B588549547F6"><gtr:id>2154E7D2-5D67-4D51-B566-B588549547F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>BILINGUALISM, EXECUTIVE CONTROL, AND COGNITIVE RESERVE: IMPLICATIONS FOR PREVENTION OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Alzheimer's &amp;
