The first objective is to explore the complex relationships that emerge between tourists and local residents in the moment of photographing and the potential for both community empowerment and/or dependency that arise through tourist photographic practice. The second is to examine the motivations driving tourists? desire to photograph local residents, the ethical considerations tourists? experience during this encounter and their awareness of the potential effects of their photographic demands. Finally, with a view to informing future policy, it explores current management attitudes, awareness and policy in addressing tourist/local photographic engagement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study adopts a three-phase methodology. Firstly, in-depth qualitative interviews with tourists before they travel to Peru will identify predicted photographic behaviours and perceptions of the effects of photographic practice. A second phase of interviewing will be conducted in Peru with tourists, local residents, Government officials and managers of key tourist sites. At this stage, interviews will be supported by autoethnographic reflection of photographic practice. The final phase of interviewing will explore tourists? reflections of their experience on return to the UK.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>53054</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference Presentation.

First, a 30-page Industry and Government Report and secondly, a set of guidelines in the form of a code of conduct. 

The report outlines the research findings which are presented in two sections. Section 1 entitled &amp;quot;The Effects of Being Photographed&amp;quot;, presents the perspective of local residents who are photographed for commercial benefits. Section 2 entitled &amp;quot;Tourists' Ethical Consideration of Photographing Others&amp;quot;, presents the complex ethical negotiations tourists' face when contemplating photographing locals as well as those faced during the immediacy of encounter. Finally, key conclusions and recommendations for future practice are outlined. The guidelines have been produced to facilitate tourists understanding of the potential effects of tourist photography and provide an outline of key steps that both facilitate positive encounters as tourists adopt behaviour that minimises potential negative effects of encounters, and in doing so, provides information that can serve to reassure tourists of their actions while photographing. The user guide is divided into four main sections that are entitled: Asking Permission, Golden Rules of Photographing, Paying for Photographs and When, Where and Who to Photograph? It is available in two formats. First, as a printable pamphlet and secondly as a single-page A4 document.

The findings have been used to inform a range of audiences. First, a Tourism Society seminar on &amp;quot;Tourism and Photography&amp;quot; was held at the University of Surrey. Research findings provided the keynote presentation with additional contributions from: Adrian Phillips (Commissioning Director, Bradt Travel Guides), Dan Linstead (editor, Wanderlust Travel Magazine) and Fran Hughes (former Responsible Tourism Manager, Explore Worldwide (the UK's largest adventure travel tour operator operating in over 130 countries)). Over 60 academics and members of industry and the public attended and engaged in over 2 1/2 hours of presentations and discussion. This therefore facilitated knowledge transfer and increased awareness of the issues of photographing locals amongst academics, industry and members of the public.

Of note, these outputs have facilitated changes to company sustainability policy and tour leader training policies within tour operators, further clarifying the key issues and areas of confusion/concern when tourists photograph local people. Research findings provided a thoroughly evidenced insight into the complex relationships of tourist photography that until now had remained uncertain. Each were disseminated to 45 tour operators in the UK, including the 13 operators who facilitated access to tourist respondents during research. The impact these outputs have had is evident as both Explore (the UK's leading adventure travel company specialising in sustainable travel) and Journey Latin America have subsequently integrated the guide into their Responsible Tourism policy and made it available on the open access Responsible Travel pages of their websites (see: http://www.explore.co.uk/images/stories/files/Photography_Guide.pdf and ). Journey Latin America have also added the user guide to the client documentation pack. Both tour operators have also integrated research findings into the training of all tour leaders working on over 500 tours in over 130 countries. The user guide is also now distributed to Explore Worldwide tour leaders as standard. This has directly benefited tour operators, which in turn has impacted upon tour leaders as well as potential and actual tour operator clients as they are exposed to the user guide either first-hand through its relevant web-presence, or alternatively via personal interaction with and advice from tour leaders on their individual holidays since its introduction in 2010. 

Wider impact beyond tour operators is also evident as Tourism Concern, the leading international non-Governmental organisation campaigning for human rights across the tourism industry, have incorporated research findings into their own research programme, in particular in the work on best practice guidelines that are currently being developed on poverty tourism and engaging with indigenous communities. Tourism Concern have also made the user guide available via their open access website on the responsible tourism section. This is free for existing and potential Tourism Concern members, industry representatives and tourists to access and download. Tourism Concern has partners in over 20 countries and has 15,000 individual supporters, an academic network and facilitates the Ethical Tour Operator Group. Likewise, ABTA have also disseminated the findings to members of their Sustainable Tourism group with approximately 120 members at the time of distribution.

Additionally, wider impact of findings has been realised through the publication of an article in Wanderlust (the UK's leading traveller magazine), which has a readership of over 40,000. This is supported by an online presence with open access to all web-users in addition to paid subscribers. The article entitled: &amp;quot;Photo Tips: Is Shooting People Painless?&amp;quot; appeared in the February 2010 edition of Wanderlust magazine, thus widening public reflection of the effects of photographing on host communities. An online version of is also available at: http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/magazine/articles/advice/is-it-wrong-to-take-photos-of-people-on-your-travels?page=all. An article has also been published in the Tourism Concern monthly e-newsletter. This is distributed to over 10,000 people and the Tourism Concern website attracts over 20,000 visits each month.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CFB72712-C89D-418A-A8B8-15B6317084F9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>First, the notable contributions made to debates about tourism (in particular cross-cultural encounters, heritage, authenticity and commodification), geography and photography are:
o Tourists' photographic encounters with locals are mediated and regulated by a complex web of agents (locals being photographed, tourists, tour guides, Government/municipality and the police),
o The agency of locals constrained by larger forces and dominant Western mythologies of the exotic Other as they strive to realise the benefits of photography,
o Performances of humanity and integrity are enacted by locals as they respond to undignified tourist performances and practices of exploitation and exclusion,
o Photographic encounters create opportunities for:
o Self-direction as locals to become active, knowing agents and co-performers,
o Mobilising meaningful interaction between tourists and locals via mutuality and trust in fleeting moments of togetherness,
o Mobilising and sharing cultural identity
Secondly, the notable contributions that advance debates on ethics and photography are:
o the complexities of the ethical struggles tourists confront in the moment of taking photographs of local communities and position tourist photography as emerging through multiple ethical possibilities rather than a singular, analytical ethical position, 
o contestations of agency performed between agents of tourist photography subsequent effects on intercommunity relations (i.e. disparities in work ethic, perceived work ethic, sense of shared identity and spaces of exclusion). 
o the provision of supporting rich, empirical evidence of the case-study.
In relation to methods, a future output will provide contribution via an analysis of the challenges and complexities of building trust during when working with local communities during prolonged periods of fieldwork.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Through the dissemination of findings via a industry and government report and a set of guidelines and code of conduct, there has already been industry recognition of the importance of these findings.
