PLANNING</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N009886/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposal plans to strengthen data expertise and research partnerships between South Africa and the UK though the formation of a new network aimed at investigating access to and use of household energy data for policy-making and planning. The work planned focuses on data infrastructure and brings together data professionals, energy researchers and policy makers in SA and the UK. It includes both knowledge exchange events and limited capacity building that help us to understand better data needs for answering key research and policy questions, and optimal methods and protocols for governance, storage of and access to these data. 

The project's aims are a good fit with the mission of the ODA to deliver outcomes that promote the long-term sustainable growth of South Africa as an emerging knowledge economy. Substantive cases from South Africa highlights some of the challenges faced both by the shortage of data needed to provide evidence for evaluation and impact monitoring of e.g. consumption, fuel poverty and demand reduction, but also the lack of systems and tools to extract and present intelligence from data.

Teams will work across the network to address key policy challenges through shared scoping, planning and analysis of UK and SA household energy data. This proposal connects centres of expertise to further progress in areas where there is less capacity than is needed for progressing the next generation of data infrastructures, and in turn, foster new research agendas. Because the centres involved are recognised as key players in their various existing roles, the fusion of their activities will enhance international pathways to impact. 

The project will contribute to the development of an internationally networked cohort of experts charged with brokering of and access to data new and novel forms of data who have the skills to work globally. To meet this final aim, the project will co-design and implement a joint UK-SA workshop programme focused on data management and sharing in the social sciences, aimed at researchers, that contributes to the global data science educational programme being developed under the wing of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). The theme of household energy data will provide an excellent exemplar for the training.
 
A number of government initiatives in SA and the UK are already exploring the potential of existing big data to support areas of planning and policy development such as resilience, preparedness and response for disasters, and capacity building and so on. Big data presents new opportunities for undertaking data-intensive research through identifying new correlation from the expansive and extant range of available digitally born energy data. Importantly these new data assets need digitally re-structuring to become valuable for answering data-driven research. An extension to the existing data curation and preservation methods is required in order to maximise the value of these new products.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal plans to strengthen data expertise and research partnerships between South Africa and the UK though the co-investigation of infrastructure for household energy data. This will include knowledge exchange and capacity build events that focus on access to and use of data. Researchers will work strategically across the new network to address key policy challenges by shared analysis of UK and SA household energy data.

Knowledge exchange impacts: Given the multi-disciplinary nature of this project we expect to deliver a wide range of benefits that include publications and conference submissions in social sciences, data informatics, and the energy/natural environmental sciences. For example In liaison with our key stakeholders we plan to host international workshops to exchange big data methodologies for curating household energy data, develop new skills for enabling, using and visualizing this energy data. A number of final reports and case studies will compile findings and investigate future sustainable opportunities and pathways for securing timely access to quality energy data. 

Policy making impacts: Increasing amount of accessible and high quality data will facilitate planning and policy-making. Researchers are concerned with (lack of) access to data for data analysis for assessing fuel poverty, consumption and demand reduction. This project will help facilitate provide greater access to a wider network of users facilitated by scoping sources and implementing appropriate governance practices. Part of the programme of work planned is to trial access for the community beyond academia using appropriate safeguards. Since the fruits of securing powerful data resources may not be immediate, and will be an on-going process to build more collections, we expect longer-term impact to manifest itself more effective data-based policy and planning. Case studies will be produced for policy and research consumption.

Research data infrastructure and data profession impacts: The proposal brings together UK and South African data professionals to share expertise and develop new research agendas. It aims to strengthen research in this area of data infrastructure between the UK and South Africa by providing joint activities between existing international centres of excellence that enhance knowledge about how best to enable data for social science and policy research. Through the partnership the project will promote mobility and develop capacity, thus contributing to the development of an internationally networked cohort of experts charged with brokering of and access to data new and novel forms of data who have the skills to work globally. To meet this final aim, the project will co-design and implement a joint UK-SA workshop programme focused on data management and sharing in the social sciences that contributes to the global data science educational programme being developed under the wing of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). The theme of energy data will provide an excellent exemplar for the training,

Engaging users: In addition to the involvement of active energy researchers with on-going or pilot projects to contribute, we are holding knowledge exchange and training and capacity building activities. Within the time frame of this project, four streams of KE and TCB are proposed that aim to up-skill data professional staff and data owners in South Africa. These include: intensive knowledge workshops; a virtual user forum (using a successfully-launched UKDS Google group) to enable consultation and involvement from a wider audience and webinars to showcase projects energy data products and infrastructure solutions and gain feedback.

Communications and engagement: This project will benefit hugely from the PR machine of the UK Data Service that is pro-active in its use of up-to-datewebsite content, blogs, social media outlets and mailing lists.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>148114</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CODATA-RDA Working Group on Research Data Science Summer Schools</gtr:description><gtr:id>B6667A9A-C81C-4AB5-8468-B421C97CF737</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration on development and running of summer school courses on data science</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The CoData-RDA collaboration have set up and are running .a first full introductory course on data science will take place in August 2016 at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy.

A full day workshop took place at the research site of the WITS Rural Facility (WRF) of the University of Witwatersrand in Bushbuckridge, in the rural north east of South Africa. 12 staff from the local Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance site (HDSS) (420 sq km covering 87,000+ people living in 14,000+ households and 26 villages in South Africa's semi-arid rural north-east) and from the Africa Centre for Population Health (also running a similar HDSS, in rural KwaZulu-Natal) attended. Both are part of the broader INDEPTH Network, set up to provide a more complete picture of the health status of communities collected from whole communities over extended time periods, which more accurately reflect health and population problems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Its 43 member centres observe, through 49 HDSS field sites, the life events of over three million people in 20 LMICs in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These sites are funded through multiple stakeholders, including the Wellcome Trust, NIH, and the EC.

The morning session heard from the UKDS and DataFirst speaking about data curation opportunities, especially utilising big data environments, for good data management of more complex data and large-scale analysis. There were questions on the process of getting the Data Seal of Approval and also some clarification provided on the relationship between DataFirst and Stats SA. Louise pointed to the UKDS-ESPA brochure on the Guide to sharing social data in a multidisciplinary, stakeholder research. Other questions arose on: ownership of data; best practices in version control of data and assigning DOIs; which metadata - DDI-Codebook or Lifecycle?; file formats; methods of gaining consent; and models of data licencing and access, such as Secure labs and Safe rooms. Louise drew attention to the UKDS' new 5 Safes animation which explains, succinctly, how the secure access model works, in providing safe access to 'unsafe' data. Following lunch, staff from the HDSS spoke of various challenges and solutions in providing access to the complexity of their data assets from their sites. Mark Collinson, PI on the Agincourt, generously hosted the day. He noted that the event was also a good opportunity for HDSS data groups from different sites to meet and exchange notes on current and future working practices, and think about how to move forward in harmonising some of their data. An example cited by Mark was coding of labour market activity, which is not consistent across the sites (use of ILO classification or not).

There are some really positive outcomes from this meeting which all feel represented a first step in better linking up work on data preparation and access being undertaken by HDSS, and the national social science data archives. further, we look forward to working with these HDSS sites to see how big data solutions may facilitate elements of their work.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://ukdataservicesmartenergydata.wordpress.com/2016/11/10/uk-visit-to-south-africa-research-sites/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Household Energy Workshop, UCT, South Africa</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF5ED712-FEF4-41FF-A22B-09AEFAC617A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This meeting was the project's first engagement event held in Cape Town on 27 January 2015.

Louise Corti, one of the principal investigators told us: &amp;quot;This course introduced part of our work on 'scaling up' data curation and user access approaches for big data, predominantly where larger or more complex data sources - bigger than the 5GB maximum download bundle of survey data that our users typically access - or where computationally-intensive and iterative modelling is needed.&amp;quot;

The course covered aspects of extraction, exploration, and statistical analysis of big data behind t&amp;shy;&amp;shy;he UK Data Service's new Data Services as a Platform (DSaaP) initiative being developed in partnership with Hortonworks, a leader in Hadoop-based data technologies. The new platform will be using solutions that deliver data at scale, with speed, and security, including Hive, Spark, and Zeppelin, which integrate seamlessly with popular data analysis environments like R and Python. We received applications for the course from universities across South Africa, including the University of Cape Town, University of Witwatersrand, Stellenbosch University, and the University of Pretoria, as well as from government agencies including the South African National Space Agency and the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa. The participants were highly experienced in using cross-sectional and longitudinal survey data, public health and medical data, transport data, financial data, and satellite data.

A productive workshop was held in Cape Town in January 2016 to discuss active research projects that make use of South African energy data. The present workshop was a small roundtable meeting made up three of our colleagues from DataFirst and UK researchers who have expressed an interest in being early adopters of the system.

Nathan Cunningham, our Functional Director of the at the UKDS, gave an introductory talk on what constitutes big data and emphasized the need to embrace new technologies that can enable us to innovate and meet new and evolving business challenges. Our new Data Service Platform is being developed in partnership with Hortonworks, the only Hadoop vendor offering a truly open-source distribution of Hadoop. The infrastructure is based on the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) as a reference architecture for data management and analytics, and Hortonworks Data Flow for dataflow management and orchestration.

These are hardened, enterprise-ready systems that can deliver stability, security and a truly non-proprietary roadmap. The aim will be to deliver impact for both the existing data assets of UKDS - open, safeguarded, and controlled - and to offer new and novel services that can deliver both exploratory and hypothesis-driven analysis along with integrated data services that interface with popular data analysis tools such as SPSS, Python, and R.

Aidan Condron, our Senior Officer for Collections Development and Producer Relations, gave a short live demo using data from the Energy Demand Research Project (EDRP), hosted at the UKDS. Apache Hive, a key component for data warehousing solutions employing a dialect of SQL can be used to rapidly aggregate and dynamically produce household energy consumption profiles. He also showed how Apache Zeppelin, an in-browser notebook tool supporting multiple analytical frameworks such as R, Python, and Scala, can be used to graph households by geographic region and types of energy installed (electricity only or electricity and gas).

The meeting then heard from researchers about their data-related challenges. First, Jonathan Chambers, a PhD candidate at the UCL Energy Institute who is using household energy data to generate data-driven models for assessing energy demand in UK dwellings, discussed the difficulties involved in transforming low quality data into a form that can be analysed. Many of his data sets suffered from general issues such as gaps, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting, as well as more specific problems such as timestamp parsing and adjusting for daylight savings. He was also forced to restrict his analysis to a small number of dwellings due to processing limits on his laptop while running his iterative algorithms on large data sets, some of which exceeded 20GB in size. Due to the complexity of his data pipeline and the size of the data sets used, it was deemed that his project lent itself well for testing the UKDS platform. The project was chosen as the leading use case from the UCL Energy Institute, and Chris Park, one of our Data Scientists, will be working closely with Jonathan in the next few months to provide scale and efficiency to his data transformation and modelling pipeline with our new data platform, which could make a qualitative difference to Jonathan's research.

Next, Anastasia Ushakova from the UCL Department of Geography and School of Public Policy, spoke on her work on developing methods for detecting vulnerable consumers using smart meter data. She uses machine learning methods to detect patterns in energy consumption, which are used to group consumers into clusters to infer household characteristics, but her project is still in the exploratory phase and she hasn't yet finalized her data processing pipeline. Louise Corti, Functional Director of Collections Development and Producer Relations at the UKDS (and UK Princpal Investigator on this UK-South Africa project), pointed out that in the meantime, baselining household attributes and consumption patterns against known data sources such as Understanding Society might be useful. Hugh Shanahan, Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at Royal Holloway, University of London, suggested that Anastasia's research could benefit from exploring alternatives methods for detecting patterns such as conformal prediction. It was decided that the UKDS remain in close contact with Anastasia as her research project matures and keep track of her progress.

Jacqueline Beckhelling from the School of Civil and Building Engineering at Loughborough University then discussed her work on the DEFACTO project, which investigates how the use of digital control and feedback technologies can encourage efficient energy use. The project uses gas readings collected every 30 minutes and electricity readings collected every 2 minutes, yielding some 100GB of data, which is currently emailed to the researchers - to the tune of some half a million rows of incoming data each day. Jacqueline pointed out that data storage, transfer, and processing were big issues that couldn't be overcome using existing tools, and it was agreed that her project merits further investigation to identify which components of her data pipeline can be fruitfully ported over to the UKDS system.

Finally, Moira Nicholson, another PhD candidate from the UCL Energy Institute, spoke of her work on using randomized control trials to test whether behavioural interventions could be used to boost the number of British consumers switching to off-peak electricity tariffs. She uses three different versions of web pages to examine tariff switching rates, and uses Google Analytics to analyse trends and compute useful metrics. While interesting, it was agreed that her work is unlikely to benefit from the UKDS platform since the data used in her work was neither big nor complex in its current form.

An interesting discussion then ensued, with researchers exchanging ideas about measuring statistical uncertainty at scale. Nathan Cunningham pointed out that the Hadoop ecosystem was ideally placed to provide heuristic tools for handling systematic errors. David Shipworth, Reader in the Built Environment at the UCL Energy Institute, then raised questions about how one could detect and flag data to indicate error and bias in the presence of non-uniform errors, and emphasized the need to better quantify uncertainties for new and novel forms of data to answer key policy questions.

Next steps

To address some of the issues discussed, the UCL Energy Institute, with input from the UKDS, will be hosting a workshop on smart meter data in October 2016, aimed at identifying a taxonomy of errors to construct a set of syntactic and semantic checks for handling smart meter data. The workshop will bring together experts from the wider energy research community, including the Centre for Sustainable Energy, Durham Energy Institute, Imperial College London, and the UCL Energy Institute, as well as data curation and modelling experts from the UK Data Service and the Institute for Social and Economic Research.

Overall, the meeting was highly productive and helped consolidate some high value use cases for energy research, and provided clarity and direction for the UKDS moving forward. The UKDS has initiated a Big Data Webinar Series, in which Peter Smyth, our Senior Officer for Training and User Support, introduces components of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem, including Hive and Spark, and invites guests to speak on issues such as: exploring diet and obesity in children using geo-demographic classifications, linking data from social media, traffic sensors, and other data sources to explore social aspects of the urban environment in the Glasgow area, and the impact of online shopping on the UK high street.

The UKDS will also contribute to cutting edge energy research projects to bring innovative big data technologies to the forefront of academic research: Bashar Al-Hnaity, one of our Data Scientists, will work closely with David Shipworth and Simon Elam from the UCL Energy Institute to develop innovative, data-driven models using our new data platform to encourage efficient policy making in the energy sector.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B4B09BD6-FE8C-41A9-B0A3-0EC8F4867AE9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N009886/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FFAA021A-6F31-43D9-8517-EA79D1E71F54</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy - Conventional</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
