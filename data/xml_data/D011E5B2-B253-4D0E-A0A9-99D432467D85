Here we propose to answer these questions and by so doing provide insight into the evolution of cognition. The prime objectives of the work proposed here are to determine the role that cognition plays in nest building and where in the brain control of nest building occurs. The discovery of tool manufacture and use by New Caledonian crows in the 1990's has led to considerable interest in the cognitive abilities required for such behaviour and the light that might then be shed on tool manufacture in humans. These insights, exciting as they are, have not yet enabled the issue of why some birds manufacture tools and others do not. Answering that question might allow us to determine the conditions under which physical cognition evolves and to determine how physical cognition differs from more general cognition abilities. Here we suggest that nest building in birds, in which the manipulation of plant and inanimate material bears a striking outward resemblance to that seen in tool use, may allow us to address these issues. Unlike tool use, which occurs relatively rarely and tends to be either present or absent, nest building is both ubiquitous and varies considerably in degree. If nest building does require some cognitive ability, the diversity of that variation allows for comparisons across species to examine the conditions under which variation in nest building occurs and those that have led to elaboration of those structures. In this project we propose to establish whether nest building does require cognition and, by determining the neural basis of the behaviour, to examine the relative contributions of cognitive and motor skills. We intend to do this using a multi-stranded approach incorporating field and laboratory experiments and two 'model' systems: weaver birds, iconic 'complex' nest builders and zebra finches, the iconic avian neural system. We would carry out experiments involving manipulation of the nest structure and varying the availability and kind of nesting materials to examine the role of cognition, utilize cross-fostering as a tool to examine heritability of nest building, use immediate early gene expression and volumetric analyses to determine where in the brain control of nest building occurs and carry out a cross-species comparison of nest structure to pinpoint the major variables contributing to the variation in that structure. In sum, we contend that this approach offers a novel way to address a number of hotly debated questions such as: what is complex cognition?, why did complex cognition evolve? and why are some animals makers of tools and others not?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We know almost nothing about why birds build the nests they do.

The work is likely to be published in high quality journals. The PI currently supervises a BBSRC CASE student who is addressing the question as to why Hooded crows nest on electrical transformer boxes on power lines on the Orkneys (CASE partner is Scottish and Southern Electrical plc). Nest building on manmade structures is a significant problem worldwide and increasing the understanding of how and why birds build nest and choice of nest site is likely to lead to the development of technology to reduce problems caused by nesting. The PI and the co-PI have industrial contacts and they would continue to pursue to develop these. The PDRA and the RA would both learn a range of skills, from the neural to whole animal, from experimentation in both the field and the laboratory. Presentation skills would be enhanced in the PDRA and the RA by attendance at conferences, paper writing and presentations at regular lab meetings. In addition the PDRA would be expected to supervise undergraduate research projects along with the PI and the co-PI. Both would be encouraged to attend appropriate training courses as offered either locally (St Andrews offers suitable courses) or nationally. Nests and nest building attract considerable public interest. In particular, the Botswana site allows for very high quality video data to be collected for public consumption such as static displays for museums. The PDRA would be expected to participate in public engagement activities run by Edinburgh Neuroscience (http://www.edinburghneuroscience.ed.ac.uk/publicengagement/index.html) such as the Edinburgh Science Festival and GetBrainy workshops for schools. The PI would offer a Royal Society Summer presentation, make contact with human basket makers (some contact already made) and with ESRC-funded researchers looking at human basket making. The PI gives talks at a range of public fora (e.g. Edinburgh zoo, Glasgow Skeptics) and would pursue all opportunities to continue and widen exposure of this work to a broad community. The co-PI would offer public lectures and to connect with Edinburgh Neuroscience public engagement e.g. Inspace (http://www.edinburghneuroscience.ed.ac.uk/publicengagement/Inspace/index.html).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60963</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of St Andrews</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Biology St Andrews</gtr:department><gtr:description>Nest building in Birds Dr Healy</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD86B6AA-2D10-4128-BF7B-C25471B43998</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hall ZJ, Ihalainen E, Meddle SL &amp;amp; Healy SD (2017).

PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) is a program in which K-12 teachers spend 3-6 weeks participating in hands-on field research experiences in the polar regions. The goal of PolarTREC is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing K-12 educators and polar researchers together.

Program Development

PolarTREC was developed based on the strengths of the past PolarTREC (2007-2009) and TREC programs, as well as other teacher research experience (TRE's) programs.

Built on the successes of the previous three-year program and adapted to further meet diverse participant needs, PolarTREC is a multi-year project with four major categories of interrelated activities making up the PolarTREC Teacher Research Experience Model.

The main components of PolarTREC Include:
?provide hands-on field research experiences that are implemented in the polar regions;
?broadly disseminate teacher experiences to students, professionals, and the public;
?develop a sustainable learning community; and
?provide clear and appropriate measures of project success.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.polartrec.com/comment/24084</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visit to the institute  Neurobiology workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7A3843BA-9800-488F-BAF3-32BC80C7D54D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>School visit to the institute. neurobiology workshop.Discussed careers in science and going to University.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Expert Women</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>72EF892A-1FDB-451F-9435-8CBDDC444686</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BBC Expert Women; Field Biologist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vx8FJg3VXo</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar: &quot;Environmental cues regulating reproduction in birds&quot; Technical workshop: Approaches to investigating circannual rhythms in vertebrates.

1) whether nest-building in two species of weaverbird and in zebra finches has a cognitive component; 
 ?To date, we have demonstrated that nest building in zebra finches has a significant cognitive component, specifically that zebra finches choose the material with which to build their nest based on their own experiences: after a short period of building with relatively flexible string, birds preferred to build with stiffer string while those that had experienced a stiffer string were indifferent to string type. After building a complete nest with either string type, however, all birds increased their preference for stiff string. The stiffer string appeared to be the more effective building material as birds required fewer pieces of stiffer than flexible string to build a roofed nest. This material preference was not a reflection of the father's preference or that of the siblings. This is evidence that nest material preference is not entirely genetically predetermined as many continue to believe. Furthermore, juvenile experience of either string type increased the birds' preference for building with the stiffer string. We have shown, therefore, that these birds learn both which material is the better material with which to build and that they can learn the material's structural properties.

 We have also shown that zebra finches tend to choose nest material that matches the background where their nest cup is located, providing the first experimental evidence that they choose to camouflage their nest.

 We have collected field data on the locations that known weavers go to collect material (for 2 nests each for 12 birds). Each male collected material from a different location, a location that reflected the location of his territory within the nesting colony. The data collection and analysis involved collaboration with colleagues at Univ Cape Town, South Africa and in Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics at Univ St Andrews.

 We have analysed textural data from the collection of weaver bird nests and found that it is possible to identify an individual signature of each male in the textural patterns of the nests they build. The data collection and analysis involved collaboration with colleagues at Universidade Federal de Uberl&amp;acirc;ndia, Brazil and in Biological Sciences at Univ Edinburgh.

In progress
We have collected data on repeatability of position in the nest of sequentially numbered pieces of string to identify similarity in nest structure within individual males. Analysis underway.

(2) to identify the neural basis of nest-building in one of those species (zebra finches); 
 We used Fos immunohistochemistry to quantify production of the immediate early gene protein product c-Fos in the brain correlated this expression with the variation in nesting behavior. We found that neural circuitry involved in motor sequencing, social behavior, reward and motivation were active during nesting. Within pairs of nesting birds, the number of times a male picked up or deposited nesting material and the amount of time a female spent in the nest explained the variation in Fos expression in the anterior motor pathway, social behavior network, and reward neural circuits.

 During nesting behaviour in zebra finches, the social decision-making network appears to be active. Several nuclei in this circuit contain neuron populations that use the nonapeptides vasotocin and mesotocin or the neurotransmitter dopamine, all thought to be involved in mediating social behaviour. We have, therefore, tested whether nesting behaviour is correlated with neuronal activity, measured indirectly by production of Fos in vasotocin, mesotocin, and dopamine systems. We have performed double immunohistochemistry on brain tissue from nesting and non-nesting zebra finches for Fos combined with arginine vasotocin or oxytocin or tyrosine hydroxylase. We have quantified the number of double-labelled cells in different neuronal populations and correlated this with the variation in nesting behaviour.

3) to perform a phylogenetic analysis of nest-building to determine the relative contribution of a number of possible explanatory variables to explaining variation in nest structure. 
?? We tested whether the degree of cerebellar foliation correlates positively with the processing capacity of the cerebellum, supporting complex motor abilities, particularly manipulative skills by investigating the relationship between cerebellar foliation and species-typical nest structure in birds. Increasing complexity of nest structure is a measure of a bird's ability to manipulate nesting material into the required shape. Consistent with our hypothesis, avian cerebellar foliation increases as the complexity of the nest built increases.

 ? We have found that babbler species that build domed nests construct those nests closer to the ground than do cup-nest building relatives. Furthermore, constructing cup nests co-evolved with nesting off the ground and constructing dome nests co-evolved with nesting on the ground. This is the first study to use formal statistical methods to identify evolutionary pathways in nest structure and location.

????????? received 150 blackbird nests from around the UK and have found that the considerable variation in the structure of those nests is correlated with environmental conditions at the time of nest building.
