A Collaborative Project to Evaluate and Rethink Internet-based Rating and Ranking Schemes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/H043500/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Over the past decade, internet-based rating and ranking schemes have become increasingly popular. Following eBay's buyer feedback and Amazon's product reviews, a variety of people, products and services are now subject to public assessment by users, consumers and citizens. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recent targets include lawyers, teachers, websites, hotels, restaurants and computer games, but also public services like health care or policing. While some have welcomed this development as an innovative way of fostering transparency, accountability and public engagement, others have criticised the forced exposure and alleged lack of accuracy and legitimacy, pointing to the potentially devastating consequences of negative evaluations for businesses, services and individuals. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will tackle these issues by turning the idea of public assessment on its head. By involving key stakeholders and users in the collaborative design and evaluation of a website that will aggregate and disseminate feedback about internet-based rating and ranking schemes, it will not only engage academic and non-academic experts in a discussion about the utility and ethics of these schemes, but also provide an opportunity for users to share their experience and learn about the implications of these increasingly important technologies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project is led by Malte Ziewitz and Steve Woolgar, Oxford University, in collaboration with James Munro, Patient Opinion.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7162</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Eight full-length videos with talks from the How's My Feedback? conference on 28 June 2011.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3104BF08-6261-4F8F-A4BF-F9585F658926</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The videos were watched multiple times after the conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>How's my feedback? : conference talks</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://vimeo.com/insis/videos</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The core product of the project: a rating website for rating websites, designed collaboratively with stakeholders from business, government, academia and user communities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F577E562-4A9E-4BD2-A315-2BB0E5A24875</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Especially during the core activities of the project, the website attracted a steady stream of visitors as well as 28 original reviews.

Specifically, we have been able to foster a research agenda around the topical issue of web-based evaluation, establish a new network of researchers across disciplines and the academia-industry divide, and demonstrate the utility of a new methodology that takes design as an entry point into enquiry into digital media. 

First, the project helped to develop a research agenda around the topical issue of web-based evaluation. While most work in this area has evolved around a rather rigid understanding of how review and rating schemes operate, the project work opened up the black box of the &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; and raised a set of questions, which are further detailed below. This agenda has received support from participants, including researchers from academia and industry.

Second, the project laid the foundation for a new network of researchers who are interested in issues of online feedback. This network draws together researcher across different boundaries: it transcends disciplines by including scholars from areas like marketing history, information systems, Science and Technology Studies, sociology, legal studies and design; it transcends geographical boundaries by fostering interaction between researchers in the U.S. and Europe; and it transcends the conventional boundary between &amp;quot;academic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;industry&amp;quot; researchers, which is increasingly regarded as a problem in social science research. For example, while participating academic researchers showed interest in the new forms of analysis of large data sets conducted by industry analysts, industry researchers appreciated the critical and thus productive approach of their academic colleagues. 

Third, the project made a contribution to contemporary discussions about social science methodology in digitally networked environments. How empirical research can be conducted in the context of digital media has long been discussed for ethnography (Star 1999, Hine 2000, Beaulieu 2004), social network analysis (Haythornwaite and Wellman 1997), interviews (Illingworth 2009), focus groups (Rezabek 2000) or so-called &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; (Manovich 2007; Venturini and Latour 2010). However, as the project has shown, it is possible to engage with and understand computer systems in practice by building them. A strategy of participatory design that involves key actors and technologies in the process can generate insights not available otherwise.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research agenda might be taken forward by researchers in the areas of Science and Technology Studies, marketing, information systems, sociology, legal studies, human-computer interaction and design. The social issues raised might be pursued by consumer advocacy groups, industry watchdogs, policy-makers, and designers and developers of reviews, rating and ranking schemes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1D72CF47-8AF5-4F06-B3EF-FFF532A6C925</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.howsmyfeedback.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4A18AB05-ABA3-4E04-9813-4E71D38BB78C"><gtr:id>4A18AB05-ABA3-4E04-9813-4E71D38BB78C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Can crowd wisdom solve regulatory problems? : a review and some provocations</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/95cd9fd738eccd2789c26576b06a3bb2"><gtr:id>95cd9fd738eccd2789c26576b06a3bb2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Malte Ziewitz (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-192-22-0005</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/H043500/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3FB490ED-1150-4B72-BB38-E3A211952C34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science &amp; Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
