Processes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/E022294/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>A significant proportion of materials are produced in crystalline form. Many of these crystals are obtained by nucleation and growth from solution. This type of crystal production is often referred to as industrial crystallization. Crystallization is a key separation and purification unit in most of the pharmaceutical, food and fine chemical processes, with a significant impact on the efficiency and profitability of the overall process. Over 90% of all pharmaceutical products contain active ingredients produced in crystalline form and typical raw material cost for a single batch of active pharmaceutical ingredient is $1 to $2 million. Failure to meet product specifications incurs significant costs. For efficient downstream operation (such as filtration and drying) and product effectiveness (e.g. bioavailability, tablet stability) the control of crystal purity, size distribution and shape can be critically important. The crystal size and shape affect the dissolution rate, which is an important property of crystals for medicinal use. In the pharmaceutical industry, the relative impact of drug benefit versus adverse side effects can depend on the dissolution rate. Control of crystal size and shape enables the optimization of the dissolution rate to maximize the benefit while minimizing the side effects. Poor control of crystal size and shape can also result in unacceptably long filtration or drying times, or in extra processing steps, such as recrystallization or milling, and can influence the purity of the product which is especially important in the food and pharmaceutical industries, in which the crystals are consumed. Improved control of crystallization processes offer possibilities for better product quality and improved process efficiency, for example by reducing time to market (and extending the length of time before patent expiration), and the reduction of compromised batches, therefore providing significant increase in quality of life, for example by making new drugs available more quickly and at lower cost. However, controlling crystallization is challenging due its high nonlinearity and its high sensitivity to process conditions. The aim of the research is to develop a systematic and comprehensive framework for controlling pharmaceutical crystal formation that incorporates first-principles simulation models, efficient dynamic optimization and model based control algorithms, as well as novel mathematical analysis techniques. The approach will allow to control the shape of the crystal and the overall form of the size distribution by repeatedly solving a constrained nonlinear optimization problem in real-time that will adjust the operating conditions to achieve the desired targets, and guarantees that the process operates within feasible conditions. Uncertainties in the operating conditions will be incorporated in the controller design to reduce variability of the product quality from its desired value. Measurements provided by in situ process analytical technology will be used in real-time by the feedback control strategy to estimate and predict the product quality for different operating conditions. This technique will be useful in treating several industrially important key problems in crystallization, such as controlling the formation of desired polymorphs and/or achieving consistent product quality despite of uncertainties due to scale-up. The end result of the project will be a novel methodology for crystallization control, which will provide a comprehensive framework (including model, algorithm, software and equipment) for the robust design of desired polymorph, crystal shape as well as the form of the crystal size distribution for specific applications (e.g. drug delivery and dosage, or proteomics), opening the way toward systematic crystal engineering in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-05-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>216088</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>AstraZeneca</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>AstraZeneca UK Ltd (Loughborough)</gtr:description><gtr:id>CF3FACF5-6626-47CE-BB52-410BEAA83F1F</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research initated in this project has led to the creation of a new research field: &amp;quot;The Pharmaceutical Symstems Engineering&amp;quot; that applies a combination of systems engineering approaches with, process informatics, advanced control, modelling, sensor technologies and chemical and pharmaceutcal engineering to produce innovative processes and product engineering approaches.

These results have very high potential for improving the production of crystalline products. A significant proportion of materials are produced in crystalline form. Crystallization is a key separation and purification unit in most of the pharmaceutical, food and fine chemical processes, with a significant impact on the efficiency and profitability of the overall process. Over 90% of all pharmaceutical products contain active ingredients produced in crystalline form. The costs for a single batch of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) can reach $1 to $2 million. Hence failure to meet product specifications incurs significant costs. For efficient downstream operation (such as filtration and drying) and product effectiveness (e.g. bioavailability, tablet stability) the control of crystal purity, size distribution and morphology can be critically important. The aim of the research was to develop a systematic and comprehensive crystal engineering framework for controlling pharmaceutical crystal formation that incorporates both model-free and model-based control approaches. The novel model-based approaches use first-principles simulation models, efficient dynamic optimization and a model predictive control algorithm. These novel approaches allow to control the shape of the crystal and the overall form of the size distribution by repeatedly solving a constrained nonlinear optimization problem in real-time that adjusts the operating conditions to achieve the desired targets, and guarantees that the process operates within feasible conditions. Uncertainties in the operating conditions are also incorporated in the controller design to reduce variability of the product quality from its desired value. Measurements provided by in situ process analytical technology are used in real-time by the feedback control strategy to estimate and predict the product quality and to adapt the operating conditions to eliminate the effects of disturbances during operation. The project delivered several novel crystallisation control methodologies (e.g. direct nucleation control, adaptive supersaturation control, distribution shaping control) which have been extensively evaluated via simulations and experimental studies on laboratory and industrial scale crystallisation systems. The proposed quality-by-design approaches have proved to be highly efficient in treating several industrially important key problems in crystallization, such as controlling the formation of desired polymorphs and/or achieving consistent product quality despite of uncertainties due to scale-up. 



The project has resulted in more than 23 journal papers and several prestigious awards. The crystallisation control techniques have been implemented at AstraZeneca and the corresponding project was shortlisted in the &amp;quot;Core Chemical Engineering&amp;quot; category of the 2010 IChemE Awards for Innovation and Excellence. The distribution shaping control approach, which enables companies to design solid products with tailored-made properties (e.g. desired bioavailability, improved packing property) received the Best Paper Award by the Computer Aided process Engineering Working Party of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering. The project was the first worldwide to provide an experimental implementation of a full population balance model based real-time robust nonlinear model predictive control approach on laboratory and pilot scale crystallisation systems.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Control of crystal size and shape enables the optimization of the dissolution rates of APIs to maximize the therapeutical benefits while minimizing the side effects.

The results from this project present important practical and fundamental components which in addition to university researchers should appeal to a variety of industries. 

 

Industrial community: The results can have direct benefits to two large categories of industries. First, the growing number of companies that provide advanced solutions and technologies (e.g. ABB, Honeywell, Cybernetica, PSE, etc.) can benefit from the developed methodology. The proposed control approaches in the project have led to a new category of industrially feasible, robust control strategies with applicability for the large and important class of batch processes. Second, the ultimate beneficiaries potentally can be chemical production companies, especially in the pharmaceutical, food and fine chemical sectors, where crystallization is a key operation. The approach can be useful in controlling the difficult polymorphic crystallization systems, and as an effective method in the scale-up process, where the adaptive nature of the scheme can adjust the operating profile to the different conditions at the industrial scale reactor. 



The approach and software can also be of interest to the process control community where there has been an increasing demand for user-friendly and efficient tools for rapid prototyping of modern control algorithms. Some of the software (e.g. the population balance modelling toolkit) has been developed under Generic Public License, therefore it can be a valuable tool for both industry and academia, broadening in this way significantly the scope and industrial acceptance of state-of-the-art model based control approaches.



Quantitative understanding of the factors that influence industrial crystallization and the corresponding tool (small scale crystallizer with the control software) emerging from this research has markedly enhanced the level of knowledge in the field and has simulated industrial interest and research activity in crystallization control. Thus significatn interest has been demonstrated by invitation as plenary speaker at more than 5 different international conferences and industrial workshops (e.g. ISIC, BIWIC, Larson Workshop, etc.), several major awards, and current interest from several major international companies in buying the developed software, such as AstraZeneca, GSK, BASF, Ranbaxy, etc.)


 Exploitation routes included the development of a software package that implementes the developed key control appraoches the Crystallisation PRocess Informatics System, which is under comercialisation at the moment in collaboration with the Enterprise Office at Loughborough University.



Impact for academic community: The results of this research have been of considerable interest to the basic research community, allowing a better understanding of factors that influence crystal formation. The features of the control strategy have provided a novel framework to engineer crystal size and shape for novel applications in the dosage and delivery of active ingredients via shaping the crystal size distribution and habit. Since dissolution rate depends on the form of the size distribution, when the resulting crystals represent the final product (e.g. drugs for inhalers) controlling the shape of the size distribution can provide novel applications in the area of drug delivery, or environmentally friendly dosage of pesticides, where particular multimodal distributions can be designed to achieve desired concentration level of the active compound. The modelling/control strategy can also provide a valuable tool in macromolecular crystallization. Due to recent development in proteomics and genomics, there has been an increasing demand in protein crystallization in structure based drug design. The proposed control strategy can be used to produce high-quality protein crystals with appropriate size and morphology for structural analysis, or it can also create an excellent framework for controlled zeolite crystallization used in the development of nanostructured molecular sieves for the production of novel catalysts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C817BDA2-593C-49E9-85FE-2C9BADCA739E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/61C7237F-03D1-4A55-BB63-929F490C2DF3"><gtr:id>61C7237F-03D1-4A55-BB63-929F490C2DF3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evaluation of the Effect of Seed Preparation Method on the Product Crystal Size Distribution for Batch Cooling Crystallization Processes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Crystal Growth &amp;
