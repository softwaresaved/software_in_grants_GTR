Examples include honeybees, ants, naked mole-rats and meerkats. How and why these groups form is a key question in biology. The main testing-grounds are so-called primitively eusocial species, in which queens and helpers are not morphologically differentiated so that all individuals still have the option of independent reproduction outside the group. Paper wasps (Polistes) are the best studied insect system. In spring, overwintered females, known as foundresses, initiate new nests alone or in groups. On multiple-foundress nests, one 'dominant' female lays most of the eggs, while the others act as helpers, foraging to feed the dominant's larvae. However, although there is a well developed theoretical framework for understanding why individuals become helpers, the process of group formation itself has been little studied. Building on previous work, this proposal will combine three novel manipulative experiments with DNA profiling to investigate group formation in Polistes. 

The work will:

(1) Test critical assumptions implicit in previous work: what options do foundresses have, in terms of alternative partners to join, and is there conflict between residents over group membership?
(2) Manipulate market forces - the supply of pre-existing groups available to potential joiners - to reveal the effect on major features of eusociality such as partner switching, helping effort and group productivity. 
(3) Test the importance of partner choice in determining group productivity, partitioning of reproduction and cooperative behaviour.

Results will provide the most comprehensive understanding of group formation in a primitively eusocial insect, and allow a critical evaluation of previous models and data.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?

The project is blue-skies research to investigate fundamental questions about social evolution. Apart from other academics, the main beneficiaries will be the public through widening participation activities. Indeed, public understanding of science is essential to maintain science funding and scientific literacy. 
 
Activities will be targeted towards:
- students (and their teachers) at schools and further education colleges taking subjects in Biology and Computer Science/ICT
- visitors to museums/exhibitions

There are at least two reasons why the proposed research should stimulate public interest:
1. Although we will use a social insect model to investigate the decision to cooperate, this decision is also a central feature of everyday human interactions, from house-mates cleaning a shared kitchen to drivers choosing whether to give way in a narrow street. 
2. The public are intrinsically curious about social wasps, both because they are social and because wasps are seen as being dangerous.

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?

Understanding the science behind their own behaviour. 

The success of popular science books on cooperation, such as Rock, Paper, Scissors (Fisher 2009), and TV programmes on human behaviour, such as the BBC's Human Planet, indicate that the general public is very interested in behaviour that can be related to humans, and so would be receptive to learning about topics related to the proposed research. The interactive approach to be implemented via the Pathways to Impact plan seems particularly appropriate to stimulate interest.

Learning about social wasps. 

Many people think that wasps are just a nuisance or even dangerous. By overcoming these misconceptions, and showing that wasps make complex decisions about cooperation, we can stimulate curiosity about the natural world, which will ultimately make us better able to conserve it. Furthermore, we can foster future generations of scientists by helping students to understand how even &amp;quot;scary&amp;quot; animals can not only be interesting, but also help us to understand our own behaviour.
