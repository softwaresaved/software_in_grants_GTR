It is thus imperative that we develop the tools to protect this valuable resource from pollutants. A key tool in this endeavour is a reliable transport model for the pollutant of concern. Without this, we cannot predict the movement of the pollutant through the aquifer, which is essential for risk assessment and the design of remediation strategies. Manufactured nanoparticles present a new and poorly understood threat to this resource, with increasing numbers of nanoparticles found to exhibit toxicity. This is of particular concern as the global demand for nanoparticles continues to grow due to their use in a wide range of commercial applications. Problematically, large scale production and use of manufactured nanoparticles will inevitably lead to release into groundwater. In addition, manufactured nanoparticles are also being designed for in situ groundwater remediation of a range of both organic and inorganic pollutants. Effective delivery of these nanoparticles, however, requires the ability to predict their movement within the aquifer and contaminated zone.
Critically, however, we are at present unable to predict reliably nanoparticle transport due to significant limitations in current transport models. To date, most nanoparticle transport models have been developed using data from columns containing glass beads or sand, where nanoparticles are injected at one end and the breakthrough of nanoparticles at the other is measured. As it stands, models based on these data all too often fail to predict nanoparticle transport. This is because we must use the breakthrough curves to infer the transport processes which occur inside the column, rather than actually seeing them in action. The column remains an elusive black box. To open this black box, we must be able to look inside the column and image the movement of nanoparticles within. 
 
Here, we will achieve this using a novel combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic susceptibility measurements (MSM). MRI is most renowned for its use in hospital settings, where it is used to image inside patients in a non-invasive manner, the patient unharmed by analysis. This same technology can be used to image inside the columns of porous media. Moreover, when we use nanoparticles that are labelled with a paramagnetic tag, the molecule becomes easily visible with MRI. This technology is already applied in clinical research, where, for example, tagged nanoparticles are used to image drug delivery.
By imaging nanoparticle transport with MRI, we will be able to create high resolution movies of nanoparticle migration through the porous media. With this dramatically enhanced dataset, we will develop far more robust models of nanoparticle transport. While MRI affords us considerable advantage by generating high spatial and temporal resolution transport datasets, it does not work so well on rocks which contain high concentrations of paramagnetic impurities, such as Fe or Mn. For these rocks, we will use magnetic susceptibility measurements (MSM). Indeed, this is a novel application of MSM, which is traditionally used to examine porosity and the alignment of magnetic fabric in rocks. This technique does not give us the detailed spatial resolution of MRI, but it does provide essential data on nanoparticle concentration and the shape of the nanoparticle plume as it migrates through the porous media. These data will enable us to test if the enhanced models developed using MRI datasets are applicable to MRI-incompatible rock. Using this 2-pronged approach we are able to test our enhanced models on a much wider range of rock types.
By the end of this research, we aim to deliver far more robust and reliable nanoparticle transport models which are sorely needed for nanoparticle risk assessment and in the design of techniques for targeting nanoparticle delivery in remediation applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder

use of manufactured nanoparticles (NPs) is very rapidly increasing in many consumer products. Inevitably, NPs will be released into the environment. There is a fear that many types of NPs could be a risk to health. It is therefore important that we understand how NPs move once they escape into the environment. Here we are concerned with their mobility in groundwaters, and this is the subject of a joint EPSRC-funded project with Glasgow University (Vernon Pheonix).
 
Field experiments using NPs are not permitted in the UK, and all research is based on laboratory experiments interpreted using computer models. The laboratory experiments often consist of columns filled with porous media representing rocks through which NP suspensions are passed. A major problem is that interpretation of breakthrough curves - the concentration variation with time at the downstream end of the columns - is inherently ambiguous, and what is needed is additional information on concentrations within the columns at all times during the experiment. One way of doing this is using MRI, and this is the focus of the work on this EPSRC project being led by our partners, Glasgow University (principally reported by Vernon Phoenix at Glasgow). However, MRI is only possible in rocks very low in iron, and these are rare. The aim therefore of the Birmingham-led part of the EPSRC project is to develop a method for imaging NPs inside columns using a method that can be applied to iron-rich rocks. The approach is to develop an imaging method using the magnetic properties of magnetic NPs.

We have developed a new laboratory rig and associated software for measuring the magnetic susceptibility at millimetre scale intervals as a function of time throughout the length of a porous medium column whilst NP suspensions are being pumped through the column. Though magnetic susceptibility measurement (MSM) logging has been attempted once before, our new rig is the most advanced yet produced. 

We have shown that magnetic NP movement through laboratory columns of porous media can be tracked using magnetic susceptibility measurements that can be interpreted to yield concentration-distance and concentration-time data in great detail.

In addition, our work shows that NPs attached to the porous medium have lower susceptibilities than suspended NPs. This provides a great opportunity for quantifying attached NPs, and may even offer a possibility of determining different types of attachment. We have also discovered that we can estimate particle size using measurements at different frequencies. This is of potentially great use, in that it will enable the process of aggregation to be investigated within the columns. 

Our experiments have been undertaken in range of porous media, including disaggregated and intact iron-oxide coated sandstone, media that MRI is unable to image. By numerical modelling of the concentration-distance results, we have shown that the imaging method is indicating processes that we would not otherwise have been aware of, offering exciting possibilities for a step-change in our understanding of NP movement in groundwater systems.

In addition to the work on MSM logging approaches, we have also undertaken hydraulic modelling on MRI results produced by our partners in this project. This proved a necessary step in developing the MRI approach, ensuring that the images were physically realistic.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have demonstrated the principles of a magnetic method that allows both imaging of nanoparticle (NP) movement through porous media and basic characterising of NP properties within the porous medium. Future work would be:
1. to refine the methods used to quantify attachment and particle sizing;
2. to develop from our existing prototype a 'production' lab rig;
3. to use the rig to investigate the moment of NPs through a wide range of porous media / rocks, providing the data to test existing, and develop improved, models of NP transport in groundwaters; this approach could be adapted to examining a range of types of NP by coating a magnetic core with the material of interest.
The outcome of this work would be a much better constrained and accurate method of predicting the mobility of NPs, leading to a much improved method for assessing the risks from the burgeoning range of NPs being released into the environment.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6681B631-16BA-4B6D-A243-9844A4D1C591</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A laboratory rig for logging the magnetic susceptibility of a column of porous medium during experiments where suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles are passed through the column.
