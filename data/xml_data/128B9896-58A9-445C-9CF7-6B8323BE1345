(TIGTHAT)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/P024408/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Globally, how people and goods move is important for urban health. Transport causes ill-health through road traffic injuries, noise, and air pollution, but is an opportunity for benefiting health through active travel. Although there are good examples, problems of poor safety, pollution, and environments unconducive to walking and cycling are common in many lower and middle income cities (LMICs). These cities are often changing fast, many are growing rapidly, and motorbike and then car use is increasing. The problem and the opportunity are large.

A number of studies have used computer based models to estimate the health impacts of more active travel in high income Western countries. However, we are aware of only three studies in LMICs (Delhi, Sao Paulo and Kuala Lumpur), all involving the applicants.

The high income studies found more walking and cycling and fewer cars could bring large health benefits. However, our work shows things are more complicated in LMICs. For example, how much people benefit from increasing their physical activity depends how active they are to start with. It also depends on how polluted the air is, because pedestrians and cyclists breath in faster. Road injuries numbers may go up or down as pedestrians and cyclists are at higher risk than drivers, but fewer cars may make the roads safer.

One way to support decision makers is to provide tools that help them to compare the health impacts of their choices. The challenge is to be both practically useful and scientifically accurate. In this project we lay the basis for creating a model that can be readily applied to cities around the world. A key challenge is data comparability and quality. Our international team of health and transport researchers in the UK, India, Brazil, USA, and Peru will assess what data are available and work to develop rules for drawing the best conclusions from it.

We will build a model for two Indian cities (Bengaluru and Visakhapatnam) and do further work with the models we have recently created for Sao Paulo and Delhi. Running the model will not just produce new results but we also use statistical techniques to work out where getting better data is most valuable e.g. do our results change more if we have better information on injuries or on walking.

To estimate health impacts we need scenarios about how travel might change. We will do this in two ways. Firstly asking what would happen if people were as likely to walk, cycle (including electric-assist bikes) a trip of a given distance as people are in more active cities. Secondly, we will look at how more compact cities might affect how people travel.

We will look at the data available in a further four Latin America and sub-Saharan African cities in depth to model them in the future. We will also look across a wide range of settings to see what data is available on how people travel and useful it is for modelling.

We will use a computer programme to get information from Google Street View for different cities and use it to estimate the mix of traffic across the city. We will see if we can use this data to predict how much time people spend travelling by each mode, and using other data about the city how active people are in total.

The project team has worked previously on using a range of data to estimate the number of road traffic victims by mode in different countries. We will now apply this approach to the urban level and work with estimating the kind of data we need for the health impact model. For calculating air pollution risk we will develop a simple method for estimating the contribution of transport to AP using global databases and we will compare this against more detailed analysis in cities for which we have better data. 

In summary this project lays the foundation for a scientifically robust webtool that can help policy makers tackle a major determinant of population health.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Urban land transport has positive (physical activity) and negative (road traffic injuries, noise and air pollutants) side effects. Studies in high income cities found substantial population health benefits from mode shift to active travel, with physical activity (PA) dominating. However, our work in Brazil, India, and Malaysia identifies a more varied picture, with a larger burden and trickier trade-offs. 

In this project we lay the basis for a globally applicable stochastic synthesis engine with a user friendly interface, to support evidence based decision making on transport and health. A key challenge is data comparability and quality. Our international, multidisciplinary team will assess what data is available and develop approaches for mapping (calibrating) available to desired data, while representing propagated uncertainty.

We will undertake integrated health impact simulation modelling for 3 Indian cities and Sao Paulo, Brazil, using sensitivity analysis to inform future empirical work. We will test counterfactual scenarios assuming changes to mode choice and land use. We will evaluate travel behaviour data for future modelling studies in further Latin American, India, and sub-Saharan settings. 

We will query the Google Street View (GSV) API to estimate ratio(s) of traffic modes in several cities. We will build an ecological model to predict travel time mode split and self-report PA from GSV data, and explore mapping to objective PA. The applicants have previously combined and imputed data to estimate RTIs by mode at the national level. We will now do this at the urban level. For AP we will develop a simple method for estimating the transport's contribution to AP using global databases and compare this to detailed analysis in several cities. 

This project lays the foundation for an analytic modelling framework to estimate multiple outcomes of interest under counterfactual scenarios with respect to a major determinant of population health.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will develop methods and tools to improve health and well-being in urban environments in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). The methods we will develop in this project will allow to predict how changes in urban transport would change the air pollution, injuries and physical activity, and how these changes would improve health and well-being, and link to greenhouse gas emission targets.

The way people and goods move around is a public health issue. Impacts are at their starkest in LMICs with rapidly increasing urbanisation and motorisation. The burden of road traffic injuries (RTIs) is predicted to rise globally from the 9th to 7th leading cause of death. In India there are an estimated 200,000RTI deaths per year, while Africa has the highest per capita burden. Urban outdoor air pollution (AP) also poses a large burden, greatest in Asia. At the same time LMICs face a growing burden of chronic disease associated with lack of physical activity (PA). For example around 30% of the adult population are inactive in Brazil.

In longer term our plan is to develop a tool that can be applied in all larger urban areas in LMICs, as well as other cities in the world. A web interface will be provided so that stakeholders (e.g. public health professional, transport professionals, other interested parties) can assess the evidence on likely health consequences of transport interventions and scenarios, and in this way promote policies that improve health. We aim that in five years we will have Version 1 of an open source, freely available health impact model developed and disseminated for India, Brazil and Peru, with other Latin American and Caribbean countries, and then Africa and East Asia to follow.

In the short term this project will bring evidenced understanding of the availability and usefulness of data for modelling the health impacts of transport. This will be strongly advanced in India, advanced in Latin America, and started in Africa. We will have appraised and tested the suitability of multiple data types for inclusion in a health impact model. We will have started data mapping of Google Street View to travel time mode share and total physical activity. We will be able to inform science and surveillance about where enhanced travel, PA, RTI, and AP data collection would most reduce decision uncertainty. We will have worked with a range of potential model users. This project will also increase our project partners' capacity in LMICs to develop and conduct health impact assessment studies. On a larger scale, availability of the model code through an open-source portal will enable scientific reproducibility.

The challenge for the study is to disseminate knowledge from these methods to potential users around the world. For details on how we aim to do this, see Pathways to Impact, and for academic dissemination Communications Plan. 
ODA justification

This research will bring long-term benefits to LMICs by providing public health, transport, and planners the means to assess health risks and benefits of transport choices. The vast majority of heath impact fo transport modelling studies are for high income settings. Few tools integrate risks due to PA, RTI and AP. The World Health Organization (WHO) Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT) is mainly used in Europeans setting with good data, and, focusing on walking and cycling, does not provide integrated assessment of motorised modes. On the other side, travel demand models, where available, contain little or no data on active travel. 

In the short-term, our project will benefit the cities in India, Brazil and Peru. We will develop and test the methods in these cities and disseminate the preliminary results to local stakeholders through our local collaborators. We will also disseminate best practice through our partners. However, the main impact will be achieved after the project when we have developed and disseminated our impact assessment model.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>422567</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P024408/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>2472941E-25F2-45EC-A735-3C0872CE6B26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.3  Psychological, social and economic factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>13981021-24EA-4648-A954-C235506E2CD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.2  Interventions to alter physical and biological environmental risks</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
