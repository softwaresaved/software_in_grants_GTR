In the clinical setting, they work directly with patients, participate in trials, and investigate how patients respond to drugs, including why certain patients develop side effects to drugs. The total number of academic clinical pharmacologists trained in the UK is small, and there is an imperative to continue to train more clinical pharmacologists and other specialists with expertise in clinical pharmacology who can work between academia, healthcare and industry. In 2010, the Government recognised that the provision of high quality-care and better interaction with Industry requires clinicians to be familiar with the relevant practices in clinical pharmacology. The universities of Liverpool and Manchester, in collaboration with industry partners, were awarded funding from the MRC to address this unmet need in clinical pharmacology: The North West England MRC Clinical Research Training Fellowship Programme in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. This programme has allowed 13 clinical fellows (high flying trainee doctors), rigorously selected from across all medical specialties e.g. dermatology, rheumatology, paediatrics etc., to study for PhDs on a variety of clinical pharmacology related research topics such as drug safety and stratified medicine - matching the right drug to the right patient. In addition to their research work the fellows received without walls training with industry and modular training in key aspects of clinical pharmacology. The programme has been a tremendous success with 56 scientific journal publications, 21 conference presentations, 13 prizes and interactions with 61 NHS Trusts. All fellows will also get a PhD.

We now wish to renew the scheme with the MRC and with 4 industry partners - Lilly, Novartis, Roche and UCB Pharma, to appoint 13 more fellows. The previous successful format and structure will be retained as will joint leadership from the two universities. Refinements to the programme include: increasing the number of industry partners thereby allowing us to cover more therapeutic areas including cancer; lengthening of the recruitment process to give potential fellows, their supervisors and industry representatives more time to develop research projects with strong alignment; identification of a lead industry partner for each fellow from the beginning of the programme to develop a partnership from the outset; ensuring, where possible, that fellows can spend up to one year with the industry partner at their site(s) performing different aspects of their project. These changes will enhance fellows' training with industry, and also increase the input provided by industry in individual projects. There will be very strong patient and public engagement (as in the current scheme) with involvement of patients in the planning of research proposals, a number of public lectures and involvement of fellows at events such as the Manchester Science Spectacular. 

The Fellowship Programme will go some way to producing academics with expertise in clinical pharmacology and helping to optimise the safe, targeted prescribing of existing drugs and the development of new therapies for human disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>There is an imperative to train more clinical pharmacologists who can work between UK academia, healthcare and industry. This was acknowledged by the Office of Life Science in 2010, which led to the award of the North West England MRC Clinical Research Training Fellowship Programme in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (CPT). The Programme has trained 13 high-calibre clinical Fellows, from a variety of specialties, to PhD level. The Fellowships have resulted in an impressive list of outputs including publications, further grant funding and active patient and public engagement. Most have graduated to academic posts. We now wish to renew the programme. The scheme is strengthened by involving 4 major pharmaceutical companies (Lilly, Novartis, Roche and UCB Pharma) who will contribute both in cash and in kind. These industry partners will provide without walls training for the Fellows, enhanced by increasing the potential for alignment between their therapeutic areas and the interests of the Fellows. All Fellows will receive modular training in CPT. We will continue with a robust two-stage recruitment process (with MRC input), but will modify it by increasing the time-interval between the two stages to allow for more input from Industry into individual projects. The Fellows will have an industry co-supervisor and spend 3-12 months at partner sites. The thematic areas chosen are consistent with: (a) the academic strengths of the two Universities; and (b) the significant investments from the MRC into the MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, and the Stratified Medicine and Molecular Pathology initiatives.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Clinical Pharmacology is a speciality vital for UK healthcare and industry and should be at the very heart of the drug development process. The beneficiaries are:
1.Academia
- Publishing in high-impact journals will ensure that the science-base grows in the pharmacological responses to medicines (1-5 yr)
- The Fellowship scheme will improve our ability to bring together diverse experts in order to enhance our specific research programmes and address the need for more medically qualified clinical pharmacologists (1-5 yr)
- Other national/ international academics will gain from collaborative links with Fellows, either from access to clinical samples, access to cross-cutting technologies, or access to intellectual expertise (1-5 yr)
- The scheme will produce 'rounded' clinical pharmacologists with sought-after skill-sets, who will make a valuable and practical contribution to the continued growth of this cross-disciplinary medical research activity in the UK (5-7 yr)
- Training of these Fellows will enhance experimental medicines capabilities within the UK, an area identified as vital for future innovation and economic growth (5-7 yr)

2.Health Care Providers
- The scheme will increase capacity in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics and help to reduce a well-documented critical skills gap in the NHS (5-7 yr)
- Newly-trained Fellows will promote and support more effective prescribing within the NHS (5+ yr)
- Data produced by Fellows will inform prognostic and diagnostic testing strategies that will lead to safer and more cost-effective personalisation of therapies (5+ yr)
- Scientific outputs from Fellows will improve the benefit-risk profile of medicines and reduce the financial burden associated with adverse drug reactions or lack of efficacy (5+ yr)
- Fellows will enhance capabilities for early phase trials within NHS organisations through the development of clinical research facilities and interactions with Industry, ultimately improving access to novel medicines for patients (5+ yr)
- Fellows will increase capabilities in precision medicine in the UK NHS, an area vital for future healthcare (5+ yr)

3.Pharmaceutical Industry
- The skills gap in clinical pharmacology is acutely felt in the pharmaceutical sector and so the capacity-building aspect of the scheme will lead to an innovative partnership between academic and pharma, integrating academic expertise from early development of drugs through to postmarketing (5-7 yr)
- The &amp;quot;without-walls&amp;quot; focus of training for the Clinical Fellows will help to build new collaborations and drive novel scientific plans between pharma, the NHS and academia (1-5 yr)
- Scientific outputs from Fellows will be used to develop drugs with better benefit-risk profiles, with associated reputational and economic benefits to the industry (5+ yr)

4.Diagnostics Sector
- There will be new opportunities for the commercialisation of diagnostic and prognostic testing strategies leading to an improvement in the benefit:risk of drugs, especially in complex patient populations, with knock-on economic benefits to the sector (5+ yr)
- It will enhance the development of diagnostics for precision medicine (5+ yr)

5.Regulatory Authorities
- Fellows' scientific outputs will better inform drug regulators and will thereby contribute towards better evidence-based policy making at a global level (5+ yr)
- It will increase the number of experts in clinical pharmacology to act on advisory bodies for the regulators, thereby enhancing national and international influence (5+ yr)

6.Patients and the General Public
- Improving the benefit-risk of existing and new medicines will clearly have a major impact on enhancement of the clinical care of patients, improving clinical outcome and quality of life (5+ yr)
- The publics interest in drug safety and precision medicine is high and Fellows will educate the public in their perception of the benefits and risks associated with medicines (1-5 yr)</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1589603</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N025989/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>DD81206B-5EB4-4BCC-AEF7-808A64606E0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.2  Cellular and gene therapies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
