Although most of us rely automatically and unquestioningly on our wayfinding abilities, they are markedly impaired in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia. This project will identify the features of buildings that make them relatively harder or easier for people with AD to navigate. The knowledge gained will allow us to create dementia-friendly architectural guidelines for use in the design of residences for people with AD.

Many people with AD eventually move from their familiar home environments into unfamiliar care homes. Unfortunately, the dramatic reduction in wayfinding skills commonly seen at the onset of AD is particularly marked when it comes to learning unfamiliar environments. Thus, people with AD would have an easier transition to new residences if these larger - and often more institutional - environments were designed to be dementia-friendly in terms of wayfinding. A psychological understanding of orientation and navigation could play a major role here but, unfortunately, current design-guidelines are mainly based on custom and practice, not theory and research. This project aims to improve matters through a series of experiments on navigation in people with AD.

Our research is innovative in several ways: We will use Virtual Reality (VR) technology to simulate unfamiliar care home environments. VR lets us change environmental features and structures systematically, to monitor how these changes impact on learning to way-find over a period of several weeks. This would be impractical in real world settings. Additionally, by using state-of-the-art eye tracking technology to record gaze direction, we can pinpoint the types of cues people use to find their way through unfamiliar environments (www.spatial-cognition.org). Finally, our experiments will allow us not only to measure the way in which navigation abilities decline in people with AD, but also to identify the mechanisms underlying these declines.

Successful navigation depends on learning to recognise places by identifying and remembering landmarks, environmental cues that are unique to each location. We will investigate this process in more detail. Our experiments will examine how AD impacts on landmark selection by comparing the performance of people with AD and healthy adults of a similar age (age-matched controls). Our participants will learn routes through virtual residences that include multiple intersections. We will systematically vary the features present at the intersections to determine whether people with AD have particular difficulties when the same distractor cues are present at more than one intersection, and/or when uninformative cues are nevertheless particularly noticeable (salient).

Next, we will use VR to simulate what happens when people move into unfamiliar residences. Over several weeks, we will (a) teach people with AD and age-matched controls to navigate a number of different routes through the same environment, and (b) compare their ability to discover new routes through the same environment, based on knowledge of the routes they have just learned. VR allows for systematic comparisons of different floor plans, so we will be able to establish the kinds of architectural structure that either help or hinder wayfinding in people with AD.

A key output of the research will be a set of empirically validated design guidelines that support effective wayfinding in people with AD. Because these principles will be widely applicable, we will work with architects, building standards agencies and care commissioning bodies to ensure that they are used to develop national standards for residential care home design. Our research will thus help to increase or preserve the independence and well-being of people with AD, avoiding a further loss of autonomy, dignity and control that is, in theory, preventable.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The primary beneficiaries of this research are people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other forms of dementia, and their families and carers. Currently 800,000 people in the UK, including 80% of care home residents, live with dementia. This figure, which is expected to double within 30 years as longevity is extended through improved medical care, is reflected throughout much of the developed world. In 2012, the Prime Minister launched a dementia challenge to improve dementia awareness, care quality, and research by 2015 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prime-ministers-challenge-on-dementia/).

One of the earliest signs of AD is spatial disorientation. This has a devastating effect on independence, wellbeing, and quality of life. It is therefore crucial that the design of care homes is sensitive to the problems experienced by residents and, whenever possible, capitalises on their residual navigational abilities. Current guidelines for dementia-friendly design reflect awareness of these issues, but they rely on architectural custom and practice, or intuition, to guide construction and furnishing (e.g., http://dementia.stir.ac.uk/design/design-guides). Not surprisingly, the resulting solutions are not well integrated with the neuropsychological wayfinding theory on which our research builds, nor with empirical evidence of the kind that we will gather.

A central goal of our impact strategy is therefore to ensure that our research findings be disseminated effectively to potential users of research. Foremost amongst these are policy-makers at international, national and local levels and care commissioning bodies, who are in a position to influence dementia care through legislation or regulation. Likewise, the architects who design care homes, the care organisation managers who commission them (working either for companies and their shareholders, or public services), and the residential care providers who manage the staff teams that service them are important potential consumers of our research. Access to these groups will be facilitated through existing contacts of the Bournemouth University Dementia Institute (BUDI).

How will they benefit from this research?
-
The research can bring about improvements in the health and quality of life of people with dementia by informing design-principles for environments that promote independence, access to outside spaces thus reducing agitation and frustration through difficulties in navigating the physical spaces where they live. The families of people with dementia will benefit from the reassurance that their loved ones live in environments designed to meet their needs, ensure their safety, and protect their independence as far as possible. These benefits will come about because we will work with policy-makers, architects, and representatives of the care provision industry to ensure our guidelines are adopted in future design of care homes and, wherever possible, incorporated into the refurbishment of existing facilities.

BUDI (Bournemouth University Dementia Institute) has many contacts with stakeholder to whom our research will be of immediate interest. We would expect the successful completion of the project to coincide with further applied or translational research to evaluate the impact of our dementia-friendly guidelines to the design of residential facilities. For example, we would seek KTP funding with a major care provider and/or architectural studio to ensure that this work proceeds seamlessly. Wider adoption of our design principles would then follow, supported by further research and dissemination. The likely timescale for such implementation in the UK would be around 5 years from the start of the project. We would expect to then see widespread major changes in practice with corresponding benefits to people with AD living in care homes and their families within 5-10 years of the design implementation process.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>215992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Residential Provider Forum March 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E34FA133-3330-40D8-B950-E2E90632F6E4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ramona Grzeschik will attend this forum on 30 March 2017.

So far, we have run two experiments exploring the role of attention in general and visual attention in particular on participants ability to learn novel routes.
Preliminary interesting findings highlight the importance of landmark objects for route learning. In particular, objects need to be salient and unique to make good landmarks. In both experiments we found that healthy ageing older participants performed worse than younger participants (i.e., they made more errors and needed more repetitions to learn the routes). However, preliminary analysis of attentional engagement and gaze behaviour during while learning the route did not reveal significant differences between young and old participants, suggesting that the control of attentional resources and visual attention do not contribute to age-related differences in spatial learning. 
Next planned steps are: 1) publish first results, 2) testing people living with dementia/mild cognitive impairments, 3) setting up experiments for the second phase of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Key findings will be published in scientific journals. Based on our findings, the we, under guidance of an advisory board with relevant stakeholders, will develop improved design guidelines for dementia-friendly environments which will be made accessible using different media (online website, app for devices like phones or tablet PC's, printed as a handbook).
