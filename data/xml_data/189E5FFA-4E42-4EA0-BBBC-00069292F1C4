This is usually achieved by adding a dye to label the medicine in order to visualise the amount of the medicine absorbed into the cell using visible or ultra-valet light. However, the added labelling dye may have an unknown effect to the overall results, therefore there is a need to develop and apply a new method that does not require any labelling of the medicine. This project will investigate on how to use a method called Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which is a label-free while chemically specific (this method can distinguish a large range of chemicals without labelling) analytical technique, to study the amount of medicine in living cell without any added labelling dye. 

FTIR spectroscopy is a well-established method for the analysis of medicine. However, it has not been used for measuring the amount of medicine in living human cell because, first, it is normally not sensitive enough to detect the small amount of medicine in a living cell. Second, it is not suitable to measure samples that are surrounded by a large amount of water such as live cells. These obstacles, fortunately, can be overcome by using a special measurement mode called the multi-bounce attenuated total reflection (MB-ATR) which can increase the sensitivity by at least 10 times as well as allowing the measurement of live cells bathing in aqueous medium. 

The project will use a medicine for treatment of cancer (doxorubicin) to demonstrate, for the first time, the possibility of using the FTIR technique to measure the amount of the medicine in living cells at concentration levels that is relevant to the treatment of the disease (~10 micro molar). This can be achieved by optimising the MB-ATR measurements through using the optimal number of bounces, ATR materials and measurement parameters so that the signal is maximised while the noise is minimised. The result of this development will then be compared to the results from the traditional methods to demonstrate that the FTIR technique is a reliable tool for studying medicine in living cell.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ability to detect and quantify the concentration of drug inside live cells without the need for labeling would be a powerful tool to help understand how cancer cells resist drug treatment. Developing such a method would help to answer importance questions such as 'does a drug enter cells via simple diffusion or carrier-mediated transport' or 'whether a drug enter cells through active transport or facilitated diffusion'. Such knowledge will greatly help in the design of new drugs as well as drug delivery systems. It is confidently expected that the results of the proposed study will bring significant benefit to industry and academia and as a result improvement in the health and wealth of UK society.

The adoption by the pharmaceutical industry of the proposed label-free and non-destructive methodology would enable rapid in vitro screening of drugs and thereby accelerate the drug development process. As the methodology can be applied to determine the response of live cells to drugs, it can aid in the understanding of how drugs work and consequently improve the design of new and more effective drugs.

Although the current work is focused on the treatment of cancer, other clinical researchers who are interested in studying diseases such as diabetes can also benefit from this research. The methodology developed can help understand the relationship between the cellular response and the treatment of the disease in order to develop better medicines for the patient, benefiting the general public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101057</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>12000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>International Exchanges</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Royal Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>542D3491-40EC-4F3E-BE0C-FF4B5E342BAD</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project is aimed at demonstrating that multi bounce ATR FTIR can be used to measure the concentration of drug in living cell at micromolar level. Initial results has shown that it is possible to measure the concentration of a common cancer drug 5-FU at therapeutic levels diffusing in live cells and it was able to extract information such as the flux of drug and the results were validated using standard methods (the results is just accepted to be published in Analytical Chemistry). 

We have further investigated the possibility of using this live cell analysis tool to monitor chemical changes inside living cells. The results have shown that when different types of cancer cells were treated with the same anti-cancer drug (e.g. a DNA targeting drug) a similar changes in the live cell spectra can be observed (results published in BBA). This lead to a new hypothesis that live cells FTIR may be used to distinguish the different cellular response upon treatment of different drugs which can help to understand the mechanism of drug and drug resistance. 

In terms of method development, we have discovered that germanium, an important FTIR optical materials which is used in some of the live cell experiments, can be damaged by the living cells when they were allowed to grow on the Ge material for over several hours. We have shown that the background scattering from the measurement increases as a function of cell culturing time because of increase in roughness as a result of the damage to the Ge surface by the living cells. We have then tested a series of coating materials to protect the Ge surface during cell culturing. We found that gelatin, a common coating material used for cell culturing, can produce a effective protection to the Ge surface by significantly reduced the roughness caused by the growth of the living cells. (Manuscript under preparation) This development is important for the future development of high spatial resolution live cells imaging using the Ge element.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results will have impact to the society and economy as this method is label-free, non-destructive and require simple equipment while the information extracted from the experimental results can aid in the design of new drugs.
