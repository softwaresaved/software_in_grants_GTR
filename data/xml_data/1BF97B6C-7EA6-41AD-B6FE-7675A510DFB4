Known in Latin America as editoriales cartoneras (or catadoras in Brazil), the phenomenon is often translated as 'cardboard publishing', because one feature that unites the diverse publishing projects is the material from which they make their books: recycled cardboard. Yet the term 'cartonera' encompasses far more than the English word 'cardboard'. It is also a reference to the cartonero figure - the cardboard collector or waste picker, a product of economic crisis and unemployment - that was so central in the formation of the first cartonera publishing organisation Eloisa Cartonera in Buenos Aires (2003). It was from cartoneros that Eloisa's founding artists and writers gained inspiration and purchased cardboard, and it was with them that they set up a productive publishing workshop that has since published around 200 titles. Editoriales cartoneras might thus also be translated as 'waste-picking publishers'. Some of them, like Eloisa and Dulcineia (S&amp;atilde;o Paulo), continue to work directly with waste-pickers. Many others, though, have recycled the idea, and adapted it to different local contexts, communities and social needs: some work with groups of school children from deprived areas, others with indigenous communities, to name just two examples. What underpins these divergent, fragmented projects, however, is the shared notion of working productively and creatively from a situation of precariousness - material, social, political, economic and/or environmental. 

In this comparative study of cartoneras from Brazil and Mexico, we explore 'precarious publishing' in its two closely inter-related guises: an artistic trend and a social movement. In methodological terms, this requires a transnational, interdisciplinary approach that analyses the projects simultaneously as a collecion of artistic texts and objects (through literary analysis) and a set of production methods, everyday interactions, organizational logics and social networks oriented toward social transformation (through ethnographic fieldwork). 

This project makes a number of contributions to research across different humanities and social science disciplines. From sociological and anthropological perspectives, it explores the ways in which theories of social movements can be productively broadened out to include - or dialogue with - phenomena that, like cartoneras, are not only artistic in character, but also fragmentary, fragile and precarious in nature. From a literary angle, it fills a significant gap in research: though these publishers have attracted attention from scholars and journalists since 2003, their focus has largely been on the unusual ways in which they publish (organizational structures and processes), leaving the literary form and content of the books untouched. Our project explores how the content and form of the books (as literary, philosophical or political texts and as art objects) play a key part in creating new relations, communities and meaning. Finally, our innovative use of interdisciplinary methods makes this a ground-breaking study for scholars approaching similarly complex movements that are emerging worldwide in response to increasingly precarious economic, social and environmental conditions. 

Beyond academia, our project is designed to create productive international collaborations between academics, publishers, cultural promoters and library archivists, which will lead to a number of shared outputs: a series of blog posts co-written by publishers, academics and librarians; a participative exhibition in London, in which participants will contribute to a new cartonera book; and a collection of cartonera texts accessible to UK-based readers and researchers at Senate House Library, Cambridge University Library and the British Library.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact is at the very heart of the precarious publishing project. Our research will extend the reach of this existing impact on cultural life, heritage and education by working with four communities beyond academia: cartonera publishers in Latin America; related organizations in the UK; the UK general public; in the longer term, pupils and students from primary to higher education. Its impact will be on cultural life, public discourse, heritage and education.
 
1. CULTURAL LIFE
A key component of this research project will be an exhibition at Senate House Library, London (in collaboration with Maria Castrillo). The exhibition will be innovative and interactive, allowing the general public to engage with the cartonera movement (to touch the objects and read the texts) and become part of it: the response book will be transformed into a multilingual cardboard book. The impacts of the exhibition will be diverse, ranging from 'soft' outcomes like transformed attitudes, values, emotions and beliefs, to increased knowledge and understanding of contemporary social movements and artistic practices (and also of Latin America for the British public).

The event at Senate House Library will benefit cartonera organizations in Latin America, helping them to gain visibility and to disseminate - that is, sell - their work to a wider audience. This event will benefit a number of related UK-based organizations (community projects, sustainability organizations, educational establishments, libraries, publishers and bookshops) by offering a space for knowledge exchange across different areas. It will also benefit readers from varied backgrounds by opening up their conception of the 'book' and of social movements.

2. PUBLIC DISCOURSE
We will disseminate our research via mainstream media (e.g. Huffpost, New Internationalist) and social media (Twitter, Facebook, including the British Library's accounts (see Letter of Support)) in order to widen the reach of our research and enhance public awareness and understanding of major social issues (social mobilization and transformation, sustainability, social exclusion, etc.). Blogs will be co-authored by the researchers, publishers and archivists for optimal reach. 
 
3. CULTURAL HERITAGE
Cartonera books are at present extremely difficult to access in the UK: there are only very limited collections in the British Library and Cambridge University Library, none in UK bookshops, and the books are difficult and expensive to acquire online due to shipping costs. To enable UK researchers and readers to access these books, we will coordinate the creation of three special collections of cartonera books in the British Library, Senate House Library and Cambridge University Library. This will benefit not only the cartoneros (financially), but also the users of these libraries (culturally), by giving them access to new, exciting literature from Latin America.
 
4. EDUCATION
Our research will be used to develop modules at the Universities of Surrey (School of English and Languages) and Durham (Department of Anthropology). Because of the interdisciplinary aspect of the project, the outcomes will be valuable across a range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes from Anthropology to Modern Languages (e.g. the module 'Arts in the Spanish-speaking World' at the University of Surrey).

Through Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement, we are interested in developing new teaching materials, workshops and education exhibitions for primary and secondary schools on creative recycling and sustainable social transformation. Indeed, though the inclusion of sustainability in the curriculum is an Ofsted Inspection requirement, schools receive very little governmental support to ensure its implementation. Connections have already been established with curators from the Saatchi Gallery (contact: Rozenn Logan) who are committed to collaborating on such projects in future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202257</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P005675/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE63480E-6C03-439A-99F3-2BBCEC64D6A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econ, Pol &amp; Env Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9EFA3E9E-2186-4589-A542-814A214E3D57</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic, Portguese &amp; Latin</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C597DCEC-497B-45A1-8662-9C7AFF112DDE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Publishing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>813866E9-8B0A-431C-A847-83DDED510CF0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Rel, Material &amp; Cog Anthrop</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
