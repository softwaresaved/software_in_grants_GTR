The research will help forge complementary regional partnerships between the two universities and with Nottingham City Council and local heritage organisations who, with the wider community, will be the main non-academic beneficiaries of the project.

For the partner organisations it will facilitate hands-on experience of research, engagement with a rich field of knowledge, and create opportunities for knowledge exchange. Participants in a Gateway to Nature Framework project conference (which encourages involvement in green and nature-related activities for vulnerable members of the community) held in Nottingham in October 2012, stated that they were partly inspired by the historic ethos of Nottingham's green spaces. The project aims to capitalise on such community-led initiatives to raise awareness of the historic importance of green spaces and their surrounding communities, challenging both local people and visitors to the city to value and utilise them even more for recreation, education, research and scholarship. Through the development of networks and exchange of experiences it hopes to ameliorate tensions between preservation, heritage and community demands such as those demonstrated recently when one group concerned with preserving the Forest's heritage clashed with community groups wanting improved sports facilities.

The City Council faces many challenges managing and preserving Nottingham's historic green spaces which are used by diverse groups with different needs and expectations. It will benefit from the project in two ways. First, the project will build on and expand existing relationships with community groups and improve communication. Second, as part of a programme to promote understanding of Nottingham's historic green spaces, and inspire interest in their varied history, the project will provide a context for understanding the diverse landscapes including the planting schemes, the original buildings and the other structures, and how they are used. In a period of financial austerity and local government budget reductions, it will provide a useful source of information and inspiration for the work of gardeners, rangers and other parks staff, who are active in the friends groups, and aid the landscape-gardening, planting and management of Nottingham green spaces.

For local communities and local cultural consciousness, the project will enhance the sense of belonging and well-being implied in connecting the city with its green spaces, and provide the urban community with a cultural resource. For the wider community, the project will contribute to the regeneration ambitions of Nottingham City Council which rely on the active participation of local and regional leaders in the public and private sector. Overtures to these leaders to discuss the results of the project will secure lasting impact because of their resulting contribution to city planning and policy making. As well as providing the benefits of new knowledge for the wider community, it will create potential for economic benefit in the region through tourism. By placing Nottingham's Victorian parks, gardens, cemeteries and public walks into the context of the city's industrial and urban history, the intention is to build on and link to the city's wider regeneration strategy, which links directly to its tourism and heritage strategy, including regeneration of the Castle Quarter; Professor Beckett is a member of the working group preparing a major HLF bid for this area.

In these various ways, the project will have an impact among conservationists, heritage and museum specialists, local history enthusiasts, and people interested in the wider aspects of landscape design, conservation and history, not least some of the thousands of contemporary users of historic green spaces.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main economic and societal impacts will be in the Nottingham region, largely realised through the vehicle of the partner organisations. The research will help forge complementary regional partnerships between the two universities, Nottingham City Council and local heritage organisations.

The City Council faces many challenges managing and preserving Nottingham's historic green spaces which are used by diverse groups with different needs and expectations. Recently the Friends of the Forest have clashed with community groups wanting improved sports facilities. In itself this demonstrates the tensions between preservation, heritage and community demands. Yet there are many encouraging signs that parks and open spaces are appreciated by the local urban community. Participants in a Gateway to Nature Framework project conference in Nottingham in October 2012, for instance, which encourages involvement in green and nature related activities for vulnerable members of the community, stated that they were partly inspired by the historic ethos of Nottingham's green spaces. The project aims to capitalise on such community-led initiatives in order to raise awareness of the historic importance of green spaces and their surrounding communities, challenging both local people and visitors to the city to value and utilise them even more both for recreation, education, research and scholarship. For local communities and local cultural consciousness, the project will enhance the sense of belonging, and well-being implied in connecting the city with its green spaces, providing the urban community with a cultural resource.

By embedding knowledge and the development of the history of the green spaces formed at enclosure, the project will provide a context for understanding the varied landscapes including the planting schemes, the original buildings and the other structures. In a period of financial austerity and local government budget reductions, it will provide a useful source of information and inspiration for the work of gardeners, rangers and other parks staff, who are active in the friends groups, with their landscape-gardening, planting and management of Nottingham green spaces.

This links directly to its tourism and heritage strategy, including regeneration of the Castle Quarter; Professor Beckett is a member of the working group preparing a major HLF bid for this area. The project will be part of a wider programme designed to promote understanding of Nottingham's historic green spaces, and to inspire interest in their varied history, development, including the care of historic trees and changing community usage. The wider regeneration ambitions of Nottingham City Council rely on the active participation of local and regional leaders in the public and private sector. Overtures to these leaders to discuss the results of the project will secure lasting impact because of resulting contribution to city planning and policy making. In these various ways, the project will have an impact well beyond the academic community among conservationists, heritage and museum specialists, local history enthusiasts, and people interested in the wider aspects of landscape design, conservation and history, not least some of the thousands of contemporary users of historic green spaces.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77191</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This play was commissioned for the Green Spaces project.

Each workshop began with an introduction to the words 'Arboretum' and 'Aviary'. This was followed by an explanation (suited to the age group) of why Nottingham had an Arboretum. The class then talked about the range of trees and the type of birds kept in the Arboretum which involved a discussion about continents. 
Afterwards the children cut out and decorated some cardboard birds. Some children took their work home, but others donated it to the project and it was hung in one of the Aviaries while Breathing Spaces was being performed.
The aim was to introduce young children in the area to some of the history associated with their local parks, and also raise awareness amongst teachers of these potential educational resources. The workshops also helped to promote the project's activities, especially the specially commissioned play, Breathing Spaces.
Overall, the workshops touched on several National Curriculum areas.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ng-spaces.org.uk/making-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nottinghamshire Local History Association &quot;Angel Row Forum&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0DF0623B-F26B-40D2-A0AF-1334AD10EE0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was organised with one of the project's Partner organisations, Nottinghamshire Local History Association, as part of their regular 'Angle Row Forum' series.

It ran from 3-30 August 2016. It was officially opened by Paddy Tipping, Police Commissioner for Nottinghamshire.
The exhibition comprised 
? a series of illustrated panels describing the creation and use of Nottingham's Historic Green Spaces
? two panels illustrating some of the project's engagement activities
? display cases holding related artefacts from the Local Studies Library collection
? ten short 'talking-heads' films featuring characters (e.g. park keeper, war widow, sportsman) who related aspects of the history of the green spaces.
In parallel there were talks by project members (Paul Elliott and Jonathan Coope), a children's games workshop, and a workshop specifically for services users of Framework's Nature in Mind programme. The project team also gave presentations to the Nottinghamshire Local History Associations 'Angel Row Forum' event which was held in the exhibition space.
Interest in the exhibition resulted in a 20 minute interview on Radio Nottingham, a double-page spread in the Nottingham Post and several requests for talks to local history or community groups.
A digital version of the exhibition has now been created and is available on the project website.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ng-spaces.org.uk/new-online-exhibition-now-available/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Open Spaces Forum at Loxley House</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E498026D-4C99-461F-AE9C-F3D8569B1ED5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Open Spaces Forum is a formally constituted body whose aim is to promote, protect, conserve and enhance the open spaces within the City of Nottingham.

It meets 4 times a year to learn about Council plans for the parks and raise concerns and promotes a range of events through its own social media outlets, e.g. https://www.facebook.com/NottinghamOpenSpacesForum/ 
Dr Judith Mills gave a presentation to the Forum about the Nottingham Green Spaces project. The aim was to inform a wider group of interested parties about the work of the project and solicit support for the public events.

Paul Elliott gave a talk The Greening of Nottingham 1840-1880 which explained the town council's commitment to tree planting during the 19th century. The Arboretum is the 'jewel in the crown' of this endeavour, but the Council also ensure that trees were a focus for the other green spaces created by the 1845 Enclosure Act. This enthusiasm spilt over into 'street trees' and tree planting in private gardens. Paul's talk was followed by a brief presentation by Judith Mills on the follow-on project's public engagement activities. 
The very wet weather meant that the audience was smaller than normal. It comprised members of the Friends of the Arboretum, Parks Dept staff and two of the City Council's tree officers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Supporters</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ng-spaces.org.uk/18-may-2016-anniversary-of-opening-of-the-arboretum/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Re-launch event of Nottingham City Council's ?5.1 million redevelopment of The Forest</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DAA0C9A0-C1FE-46B6-9C42-2E617C4AF029</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stall at event for interested people to drop by, find out more about the research, add their names to the contact list, and generally discover more of what was going on.

The purpose was to engage with children in a way that encouraged them to find out more about how parks were used in the past and the type of activities that were available to children in the Victorian period. Although advertised in the same way as the play and exhibition, the events, unfortunately, did not attract as many people as hoped.

The films were based on the research carried out by both the academic project team and community partners during the original Green Spaces project (2013-14). 

Following on from the development of the Breathing Spaces play, each video featured a different character from a different period in history explaining to camera the importance of the parks and green spaces for them. Some of these characters appeared in the play, some not.

Each character was performed by a volunteer performer, a mixture of those who performed in the show and others.

The 10 videos were performed by local actors. The videos 
were first shown as part of the project exhibition during August 2016 and remain available via the project website.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ng-spaces.org.uk/the-ten-films-for-breathing-spaces/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk to Burton Joyce and Bulcote Local History Society &quot;Nottingham's Historic Green Spaces&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BF30D445-A48A-4DD0-A9A1-784A58B69A73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Judith Mills had been invited by the Burton Joyce and Bulcote Local History Society to give a presentation to its members as the first of its winter programme of talks.

The workshops also helped to promote the project's activities, especially Breathing Spaces.

Organised by creative writing tutor and lecturer Angela Foxwood, 30 children from a local primary school attended a workshop. The workshop began with a brief history lesson about how the appearance of Nottingham has changed over the past 300 years, with particular attention paid to the enclosure of earlier green spaces and the establishment and preservation of Nottingham's historical green spaces as a result of the 1845 Enclosure Act. 

The school children were then shown a selection of photographs and paintings of Nottingham's parks through the ages. These images were used as prompts for them to write short poems or other short pieces of imaginative writing inspired by the images and the history of the parks.

Many of the poems/writings were selected and added, along with the images and a timeline to create a large tapestry. This tapestry was then included as part of the project's public exhibition in Nottingham Local Studies Library during August 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Parklands in Wartime: Nottingham's parks in WW1 and WW2</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>44E4EB7E-487A-4830-904B-86BAD316FD82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This public lecture by Dr Jonathan Coope was given as part of the programme associated with the project's public exhibition in Nottingham Local Studies Library.

2. The value of reaching out to, and working with, local community partners, to create new networks both informally and through the Nottingham Contemporary event held on 18 January. Presentations were made both by team members and also by individuals, and individuals on behalf of community groups. A feedback session was held at the end of the day which pointed to a new way of thinking about the green spaces on the part of the community groups, notably on the issue of the contestation of space.
3. Unexpected but distinctive linkages with local community groups, particularly Green Activists, with local history enthusiasts who came to appreciate the degree of common interest they had in researching historic green spaces.
4. Bringing together of an academic audience and community group members in a conference held at the University of Nottingham on 10 January 2014. Papers were presented by academics from various universities, and large audience of non-academic researchers from the local community groups both attended and engaged in discussion. The linkage between the two groups worked better than we had anticipated and showed important synergies between community groups researching and working at the local level and academic specialists.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Information prepared for and submitted to Nottingham City Council for information panels in the Arboretum.
