Whilst, over the past two decades, scholars have become increasingly interested in the relations between film and the other arts, to date research efforts have concentrated mainly on specific interfaces notably between film and painting and film and literature. This network aims to offer a stimulus for new directions in the study of cinematic intermediality (that is, the interaction and crossing-over between cinema and the other arts), opening up new areas of research and new creative pathways. It intends to foster dialogue and exchange between researchers from different Humanities disciplines (Film and Media Studies, Media Arts and Design, History of Art, Theatre and Performance, Modern Languages) and practitioners through a series of four workshops and related knowledge exchange/ impact events. The workshops will examine the manifold ways in which the cinema references, incorporates and reframes other artistic practices, initiating fusions and cross-overs between different media. Particular emphasis will be given to the permeability between cinema and the other arts in avant-garde and experimental practice and its legacy in mainstream film, as well as to the role of technology in forging new connections between film and the other arts. 

The border-crossings between cinema and the other arts that are at the centre of this project allow us to revisit questions regarding the specificity of the cinematic medium, questions that are all the more pressing in our digital, 'post-media' age. By engaging researchers and practitioners in dialogue around these questions the network seeks to broaden the traditional horizon of film studies, fostering a better understanding of the ways in which cinema is shaped by the other arts and providing a platform for reflecting on film's status as an 'impure' medium where different art forms intersect and communicate. Inserting itself into the burgeoning field of intermediality studies, which is stimulating thinking across disciplines, the project will make a timely intervention in a more general debate about the relationship and cross-fertilisation between different art forms.

The four workshops will experiment with novel forms of presentation and exchange by inviting a mixture of formats (combination of short position papers and exploratory talks, round table discussions, discussion groups based on papers submitted prior to the workshops, illustrated presentations by practitioners). They are accompanied by a series of knowledge exchange / impact events which will place emphasis on curatorial outputs and engage a wider public in the network's research base. The findings of the project will be beneficial to researchers interested in the relations between film and the other arts working in a broad range of Humanities disciplines. The network involves three external partners, the newly opened LUX Scotland, Filmhouse Edinburgh, and Aberystwyth Arts Centre, opening up possibilities for future collaborations between the first two institutions and allowing Filmhouse and the Aberystwyth Arts Centre to extend their programming of non-mainstream work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will achieve a wider impact through engaging practitioners, cultural organisations and members of the public in the research of the network. Its main non-academic beneficiaries are the practitioners involved in the project, the three external partners (Aberystwyth Arts Centre, Filmhouse Edinburgh and LUX), and the wider public engaged in the events that accompany the four workshops. 

The key benefits are:

- new creative stimuli and networking opportunities for the practitioners through exchange with academics and other practitioners

- new programming opportunities, access to new audiences, new collaborations for the three external partners: 
the events accompanying workshops 1 (screening of films by Mara Mattuschka and Chris Haring based on live theatrical performances) and 3 (festival of intermedial avant-garde films), held in collaboration with the Aberystwyth Arts Centre and Filmhouse Cinema Edinburgh, will allow these two institutions to extend their programming of non mainstream cinema, incorporating intermedial films into their programming. This broadening of their activities will give them access to new audiences and is likely to have an economic impact in the immediate and longer term. The involvement of LUX, the major distributor of artists' moving image in the UK, in the latter event will encourage future collaborations between the newly opened LUX Scotland and Edinburgh-based organisations, since LUX activities are so far limited to Glasgow and Dundee. LUX Scotland's mission statement includes developing 'new touring and screening initiatives in collaboration with arts venues across Scotland [...] and new public research resources' (http://luxscotland.org.uk/mission/). The network lays the foundations for fulfilling these aims both through its academic research and its public engagement activities. It will feed into and complement LUX's emphasis on learning by establishing a new collaborative research resource on intermediality in avant-garde film that will be accessible through the LUX website. 

- enhancement of knowledge and cultural enrichment for a wider public:
the public events accompanying the four workshops will engage a diverse audience in the network's research base, allowing them to reflect on film's relationship with the other arts through film screenings, illustrated talks by practitioners, and audience debates led by members of the network. Together these various events will increase public awareness of the cross-fertilisation between film and other artistic practices and of the inherently 'impure' nature of the filmic medium.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24840</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Dance on Screen' Event, Aberystwyth Arts Center, 29 April 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB08A4FD-D06D-44F7-9F8A-DE0B2938ECF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Dance on Screen: Four Collaborative Works' showcased rarely seen works by two UK artists who are practitioner members of the Research network, as well as of a prominent Austrian filmmaker, who all work at the interface between performance and film. The event was introduced by CI Kim Knowles and followed by a Q&amp;amp;A with filmmaker Adam Roberts conducted by Knowles. Screening notes were provided during the screening and have been uploaded on the project website. The event engaged a diverse audience in the network's research base, allowing them to reflect on film's relationship to the performing arts, in particular classical and contemporary dance and theatre. The event allowed the Aberystwyth Arts Center to extend its programming to incorporate intermedial films and to showcase both regional, national and international dance films. It was an excellent platform for filmmaker Adam Roberts to show and discuss his collaborative work with acclaimed choreographer Jonathan Burrows and ballerina Sylvie Guillem. The Q&amp;amp;A sparked questions and discussion about the hybrid nature of dance film, as well as the collaboration between filmmaker, choreographer and dancer. Adams has since been invited to present his work to Performance Studies students at Aberystwyth University. Extracts from two of his films and the practitioner's talk he gave at the first workshop of the Research network are available on the Project Website to afford greater visibility to his work. The event at Aberystwyth Arts Center was also an excellent opportunity to give greater visibility to the work of Swansea-based artist Tanya Syed and Welsh movement artist Simon Whitehead: one of the featured films was a cinematic rendition of Simon Whitehead's live performance work 'Studies for Maynard'. This equally generated considerable interest from audiences, making them reflect on the recreation of a live performance in the filmic medium.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.filmandarts-network.hss.ed.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Film Screening and Q&amp;A with Filmmaker Isabel Rocamora, 24 February</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1589B635-E2FE-458E-9B9D-9756DCF04D4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In conjunction with the third workshop organised by the Research Network, internationally acclaimed artist filmmaker Isabel Rocamora, who is one of the members of the network, gave a practitioner's talk which was followed by the screening of one of her recent works, Body of War (2010), plus a Q&amp;amp;A with the artist. Held at the University of Edinburgh, the event consisted of network members, artist practitioners and PhD students. Rocamora's talk and film sparked an intense discussion with the audience, notably around the use of performance and her staging of her actors in her filmic work. It impacted on the ways in which the researchers present perceive the interface between choreography and moving image work, deepening their understanding of the creative process that underlies a highly stylised, yet also strikingly real piece like 'Body of War'. The event allowed Rocamora to present her work to an international audience and to make contact with other artists engaged in single screen and gallery based works, in particular Tanya Syed. The screening was accompanied by screening notes to facilitate understanding of Rocamora's project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.filmandarts-network.hss.ed.ac.uk/event/workshop-3-the-intermedial-avant-gardes/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Screening, Sarah Pucill 'Magic Mirror', Cambridge, 30 September 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5E1D8A9-7B70-4B51-AB2B-7C101F4DE70A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of our second workshop at the University of Cambridge which brought together network members and practitioners from the UK and abroad, we organised a public screening of filmmaker Sarah Pucill's acclaimed 'Magic Mirror' (2013), followed by a Q&amp;amp;A and audience discussion conducted by CI Kim Knowles. Part essay, part film poem, Pucill's first feature length film 'Magic Mirror' (75min, b/w, 2013), which premiered at Tate Modern, extends the artist's concern with the animation of a still image as well as her focus on relationships between women by paying homage to French Surrealist artist Claude Cahun through the transposition of Cahun's images and words into film. 'Magic Mirror' re-stages and animates many of Cahun's photographs on 16mm black and white film, bringing movement and a chorus of voices to Cahun's autobiographical text 'Aveux Non Avenus' (Confessions Denied 1930). The audience was provided with detailed screening notes to help them understand better Pucill's intermedial approach to translating Cahun's photographs into filmic tableaux. Both these screening notes and the recorded Q&amp;amp;A have been made available on our project website to make them accessible to wider audiences. The audience discussion sparked questions about the role of women in the film industry, the use of obsolete techniques in contemporary film, as well as the creation of a dialogue across temporal, cultural and media boundaries between two artists who share a similar iconography and thematic concerns. Pucill, who is one of the practitioners involved in the network, was able to show and discuss her work outside London, making it intelligible to audiences who are not necessarily familiar with experimental works. The audience reported back enthusiastically on their enjoyment of the screening and Q&amp;amp;A, which afforded them enriching insight into both the oeuvre of Claude Cahun and the work of Pucill, and helped them change their views on film animation (often associated with entertainment rather than art) and general attitude to experimental works. Pucill also seized this opportunity to talk about her forthcoming film 'Confessions to the Mirror' which premiered at the London Film Festival the following week. The event has put her in touch with new audiences and offered her networking opportunities through exchange with academics and other practitioners who attended the workshop and screening.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.filmandarts-network.hss.ed.ac.uk/podcast/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Avant-Garde Film Season, Filmhouse Edinburgh, 25-26 February 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6561307F-8A7D-477C-B4DF-85B517706E83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In conjunction with the Research network's third workshop at the University of Edinburgh on 24 February, entitled 'The Intermedial Avant-Garde', over the weekend of 25 and 26 February we organised a very successful season of Avant-Garde films at Filmhouse Edinburgh. The season was curated by filmmaker Tanya Syed, one of the artist members of the network, and CI Kim Knowles. Using the collection held by the LUX Centre for Moving Image, one of the project partners of the network, the programme was an exercise in archival mapping, combining the historical and the contemporary, the rare and the classic, to reveal new connections across the history of avant-garde filmmaking. Over four thematic screenings a total of 25 films were shown, most of them very rarely seen. Indeed, so rarely are these films screened that LUX had forgotten that it held one of them, Joelle Bouvier and Regis Obadiah's 'La Chambre' (1988) in its archives. The season explored the diverse ways in which cinema dialogues with other of art forms: painting, drawing, architecture, dance, performance, sound and poetry. The works invited spectators to reflect on the language of film and its ability to transform and be transformed by other creative mediums. The season was attended by a total of 172 spectators, which is considerable for a non-mainstream avant-garde event. Each of the four screenings was preceded by a substantial introduction delivered by Syed and Knowles and was accompanied by extensive screening notes to facilitate understanding of these artistically complex, often non-narrative films. The screenings included two films by Syed and two works by George Saxon, an avant-garde artist who is affiliated with the network. Syed and Saxon were available to discuss their work with audiences after the screenings. The reception of the films was overwhelmingly positive with audience applause at the end of the screenings. One spectator commented 'It was so wonderful, because it gave me a chance to experience the umlimited possibility of the camera'. Another stated: 'The four screenings were very rich, full of surprises, and contradictory emotions, so everything we can expect from cinema I guess. Better than the oscars'. The programme and screening notes will be available to a larger audience via the project website. Given the success of the programme and interest it is already generating both nationally and internationally, there are plans to expand it and tour it in museums and art centres. The season was an excellent opportunity for practitioner members of the network to showcase their work, for giving visibility to the LUX who have recently opened an office in Scotland and for putting filmmakers in contact with one another.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.filmandarts-network.hss.ed.ac.uk/event/season-of-avant-garde-films-filmhouse-edinburgh-25-26-february/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N001907/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
