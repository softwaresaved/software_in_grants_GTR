The rise of Hindu nationalism in India, debates about the Christian character of the European Union, and the implementation of Sharia law in several Nigerian states all point to the fact that famous social scientific predictions that secularism would follow modernity have not come to pass. These examples, as well as numerous others from across the globe, raise some important questions: What are the political effects of religious nationalism? How do changes in the political status of a religion impact ritual life, belief, and practice? Is it possible for a religious state to protect the rights of all of its citizens, including those that fall outside the religious boundaries it creates? And, perhaps most fundamentally, what role should religion play in public life?

This project explores these broad questions through a specific case study: Zambia, the only African country to make a state-sponsored declaration that it is a Christian nation. &amp;quot;The declaration,&amp;quot; as it is often called, has recently become a source of concern for international bodies like the UN, as it raises questions about the rights of sexual and religious minorities. The declaration is also a source of debate among Zambian Christians. Although for some, especially Pentecostals, the declaration represents an agreement with God that protects Zambia, other Christians have argued that it hinders the church's capacity for political critique.

Empirical data on these debates, including a careful examination of what it means for Zambians from different backgrounds to live in a self-proclaimed Christian nation, will provide a picture of the realities of religious nationalism in a different context to that which we are used to seeing, as academic discussions of this topic have typically focused on the Islamic world or the secular West. The Zambian case therefore provides a fresh perspective on established debates. This is important not only because it expands academic knowledge, but also because it provides the public with stronger evidence for decision-making about the future role of religion in public life. In Zambia, these decisions will be made through a referendum to approve a new constitution, and with it the declaration. The UK is also facing important decisions about the public role of religion, for instance in debates about assisted suicide. Research on the declaration therefore has implications for public debate both in Zambia and at home in the UK.

In order to understand Christian nationalism in Zambia, this project employs a mixture of established ethnographic tools and innovative, community-based methodologies. Given the role of media in shaping the public's idea of the nation, I pay particular attention to the way that political actors, church leaders, and ordinary Zambians engage with newspapers, television, and radio, as well as new media like blogs and online news sites. I will explore these issues through focus group discussions of news broadcasts, as well as a series of call-in radio shows that will allow the Zambian public to drive the direction and content of my research. This project will also engage with the discussions of Christian nationalism emerging from the religious sphere through ethnographic research in two churches. Finally, data will be collected through interviews with Zambian citizens whose rights are most obviously threatened by the declaration, namely members of religious and sexual minority communities. Following initial fieldwork in Zambia, I will collaborate with scholars working in other post-colonial countries in which Christianity plays a prominent role in state politics to develop a comparative picture of Christian nationalism in the Global South. This project will pave the way for a larger comparative study of religion and political economy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries described above, this project will also have an impact on a number of groups beyond academia. These include:

1. Members of the Zambian public, activists, and civil society organizations 

For more than a decade Zambia has been engaged in a process of constitutional review and revision. When a new constitution is finally produced, it must be passed by a referendum before it can come into effect. One of the central issues in this referendum will be the declaration. Research into what the declaration means to Zambians from various backgrounds will therefore have an important role to play in shaping public debate around the status of the declaration, and with it the new constitution as a whole.

In order to ensure that the results of this research reach as many Zambians as possible, I will involve members of the public in knowledge-production process through focus groups and radio call-in shows. In addition, I will organize a forum in Lusaka on the Christian nation debate. I have a number of contacts with the public and religious media in Zambia, which I will draw on to ensure the forum has broad media coverage. I will organize this event in conjunction with the Zambian Governance Foundation for Civil Society and the Oasis Forum; working with these organizations will ensure that the results of the forum are effectively communicated to the public. I will also give media appearances in Zambia, both in English and in local languages (I speak Bemba and will be learning Nyanja as part of this project), and submit written work to online media outlets like Zambia Watchdog. 

2. African policy makers

Across the African continent, religion has been at the centre of debates about human rights. These debates have been dominated by the voices of elite actors. This project, in contrast, will focus extensively on the experiences of ordinary Zambians, providing a fresh perspective on this issue and enabling those at the front lines of discussions about religion's role in public life to better understand the viewpoints of those on all sides of the debate.
 
As it can be very difficult for academics to get the attention of decision-makers, I will work with gatekeeper organizations, including the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection and the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa to help make the findings of my research available to lawmakers and other elected officials. Building on my recent experience contributing to an amicus brief on an asylum case, I will also engage lawmakers directly through a brief, which will offer policy recommendations on the basis of my data and which I will submit to the Zambia Law Development Commission.

3. Members of the UK public

At the same time that Zambians have been debating the declaration, Britain has wrestled with questions about its status as a Christian country - whether, for example, there should be bishops in the House of Lords. Here, the Zambian case lends an important comparative perspective to the religious status of the UK, opening up new lines of discussion and helping to move the debate forward.

The results of my research will be made available to the public in the UK through media appearances and articles published in popular venues. I will draw on the contacts I plan to make during the MediaTalent@Ed training program and seek the advice of the University of Edinburgh's press office in order to make connections at top media outlets like BBC Scotland. In addition, I will work with researchers at Theos Think Tank to author a report on Christian nationalism, focused specifically on what my findings in Zambia have to say to people in the UK. Finally, I will develop thechristiannationproject.net, an interactive web-based exhibition that will include stories from Zambia and other countries grappling with the implications of Christian nationalism.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>133684</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N017412/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35CC531E-67B1-44F7-83DF-824B0C49CF9E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Contemporary Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE63480E-6C03-439A-99F3-2BBCEC64D6A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econ, Pol &amp; Env Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>813866E9-8B0A-431C-A847-83DDED510CF0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Rel, Material &amp; Cog Anthrop</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
