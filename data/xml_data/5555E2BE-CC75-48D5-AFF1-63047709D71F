It aims to contribute to cross-cultural dialogue in a post-9/11 context of reception in which the Arab and Muslim worlds, and individuals and groups connected to those worlds, continue to be perceived reductively and in opposition to the 'West'. The author of this project is not herself Arab or Muslim but believes that intellectual engagement with other cultural perspectives and creative material, much of which is already available in the West, can contribute to enhanced mutual understanding.

North Africa and the Middle East have been generative contexts for the emergence of postcolonial thought in the West (one thinks of the influence of Edward Said, Albert Memmi or Frantz Fanon and, less directly, Jacques Derrida). The North African Maghreb has been a key site of enquiry for Francophone literary scholars and Middle Eastern studies has assessed an Arabophone literary tradition. Some attention has been paid recently to film and other visual media from Arab/Muslim perspectives. However, creative work which draws upon Middle Eastern and North African contexts is still under represented, particularly in postcolonial studies in English. While some writers are well known (for example, Nawal ei Saadawi), there is relatively little familiarity in the English academy with a canon of women's texts which began to emerge in the early twentieth century and which now represents a substantial and vibrant body of work.

The project will draw together texts in English, French and in translation in order to trace common concerns and creative strategies in women's self-representation. From the early twentieth century to the present, women have produced creative work which enters into dialogue and often conflict with dominant discourses about empire, nationalism, patriarchy, Arabism, Islam, feminism, neo-imperialism, race and religion. Because women's bodies have been subject to particular surveillance and their voices constrained by gendered codes of propriety, attitudes toward individualism and culturally marginalising narratives, a refiguring of the relationship between voice vision and visibility is a recurrent concern in women's creativity. This project focuses upon ways in which Women reframe the relationship between visibility, vision and voice in more enabling ways and as creative agents in our contemporary world.

The book will introduce historical, geo political, critical and theoretical contexts at stake in the analysis of this material. The terms 'Arab' and 'Muslim' are used strategically to identify politically constructed loaded c categories, but also to problematise what exactly these terms refer to and elide. The book will provide an opening chapter on canonical representations of Arab/Muslim women in travel writing, anti-colonial theory and post-independence literature. The main body of the text will then engage with material which issues from women's own perspectives on gendered identity in relation to colonialism, nationalism private and public space family narratives and migrant and minority contexts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>13456</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C2ABD638-46E7-49B8-855F-C270DFAADBBE"><gtr:id>C2ABD638-46E7-49B8-855F-C270DFAADBBE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Arab, Muslim, Woman: Voice and Vision in Postcolonial Literature and Film</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fa2dc3c8c3b6dc998ff8eae9dde7054b"><gtr:id>fa2dc3c8c3b6dc998ff8eae9dde7054b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Moore Lindsey</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>0415404169</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E505716/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>470B20F0-5FD1-4AA6-8809-5E2780CBDB18</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>67D06C0B-53E4-47FE-8186-CBCE56A1271E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
