Mathematics is framed within some fixed 'foundational theory'. More concretely, in the practice of advanced mathematics one often needs to specify a foundational theory within which one intends to develop some mathematical theory of interest. This foundational theory, also called basis theory, is formalised in some fixed formal language and consists of a list of axioms, which are reasonable (self-evident) statements, in the fixed formal language, about the mathematical universe. The mathematical theorems one obtains working within the basis theory are simply the statements that can be derived, in finitely many steps, from the axioms of the basis theory using certain well-defined rules of logic. The most standard foundational theory for mathematics is known as ZFC (Zermelo Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of Choice), but sometimes people consider strengthenings of ZFC obtained by adding to it so-called 'large cardinal axioms'. These are a family of axioms that naturally build, modulo ZFC, a hierarchy of stronger and stronger theories. It is a remarkable fact that every theory occurring naturally in mathematics can be interpreted in one of the resulting foundational theories. Another remarkable fact is that none of these foundational theories T decides all mathematical statements. This means that there are statements S such that neither S nor its negation can be proved within T (equivalently, this means that one cannot derive any contradiction from assuming the axioms of T together with S, or from assuming the axioms of T together with the negation of S). This phenomenon is known as independence. 

The ultimate goal of this project is the detailed study of combinatorial properties of infinite mathematical objects in the context of the independence phenomenon. More concretely, the project focuses mainly on the development of specific 'forcing' techniques aimed at proving that certain such properties are consistent with ZFC, possibly enhanced with large cardinal axioms; in other words, proving that no contradiction can be derived from assuming, within standard mathematics, that the relevant objects have these combinatorial properties (this is of course only one half of the task of proving the independence, from a given basis theory, of the statement saying that a certain property holds for all relevant objects; the other half of the task is to prove the consistency of the statement saying that no object has the property under discussion). In our context, the proof of some such consistency is carried out in practice by building a particular model of the usual axioms in which the properties hold, obtained as a carefully chosen 'forcing extension' of the universe. This forcing extension is a certain extension of the mathematical universe obtained by adding, in a precise well-defined way, a new object to it. Another way to accomplish this is by deriving the combinatorial property of interest directly from some 'forcing axiom', which has previously been shown to be consistent relative to ZFC (together with large cardinal axioms), again by means of some forcing extension. These forcing axioms are typically very powerful natural extensions of the usual axioms, in the sense that they tend to provide a rich theory of the infinite; the usual axioms are too weak to decide such a theory. The applicability of this type of research outside of mathematics might come from connections to theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, for example in the context of modelling infinite processes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact on society that this project is likely to have can be described as being twofold: On the one hand it will impact on society by enhancing the creative output of individuals, and on the other hand it will do so by contributing to the general cultural wealth. 

Regarding the first source of impact, this research will have an important positive impact on the post-doctoral research assistant's starting research career. In particular, it will help widen the scope of his expertise. At a more general level, the PDRA will benefit from being embedded in the excellent logic group at UEA. Also, in the other direction, the presence of the PDRA will clearly enhance the creative output of the graduate students in logic at UEA (at the proposed project start there will be two graduate students working in set theory under the PI's supervision). 

We (the PI and the PDRA) will also disseminate our work to other audiences of non-specialists, for example graduate students in set theory based in other institutions. Appropriate forums for this would be summer schools in set theory, or the (annual) Young Set Theory Workshop. We will intend to present our work in these types of event; this should have an inspiring and educational effect on new generations of set-theorists. 

As to the second source of impact mentioned above, we should stress that the questions and issues we are proposing to work on are truly central ones in contemporary set theory and are, in fact, at the focus of the experts' attention. Advance in these problems and in our mastery of this technology will greatly advance the field; in particular, its effects will propagate throughout set theory and other neighbouring disciplines. The proposed research will thus have a strong academic impact and, in this sense, it will contribute greatly to the cultural wealth.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>276903</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We are in the process of writing a paper with the construction of a model of ZFC in which measuring holds together with the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). The proof seems to be correct, and now we are writing it up. This is joint work with M.A. Mota. The possibility of building such a model was a major open question in the area of building models of interesting statements in the presence of CH, and one of the main problems to be treated in this project. 

Also with Miguel Angel Mota, we have extended some earlier work on construction of models of ZFC in which the measuring holds and the continuum is large. This appers in a paper entitled &amp;quot;Measuring club-seuqences together with the continuum large&amp;quot;, which has recently been accepted for publication in the Journal of Symbolic Logic. 

We also have a concrete scenario for building, for every regular cardinal \kappa, a superatomic Boolean algebra oh width \kappa and height \kappa^{++}. This was a well-known open problem. We need to start writing this up, though.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This section does not seem to apply yet: The award is still active.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>02BB3ECC-1B3A-4FB1-8045-B430CCEAEC13</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://archive.uea.ac.uk/~bfe12ncu</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N032160/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
