Dementia</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L001802/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This programme aims to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>investigate how lifestyle changes may reduce risk of dementia, and understand the social impact of dementia&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>develop and evaluate a social intervention to enhance independence for people with dementia.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) cohort which has followed 10,000 older people over ten years assessing health, wealth, lifestyle and social activities will be analysed to examine dementia prevalence amongst older people, and the potential impact of lifestyle changes (eg exercise) on how cognitive abilities change over time. The study explores the concerns and experiences people have (eg loss of independence) when referred to memory services, at diagnosis, and for the following two years.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A consultation with people with dementia and their carers, and an appraisal of research evidence will be used to develop a social intervention to promote lifestyle changes to enhance cognition (eg computer use) and independence. The social intervention delivered by a dementia advice worker will be evaluated in a large clinical trial in UK memory services to assess benefits to independence and quality of life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Training and development opportunities for all grades of researcher will develop capacity for research in dementia care. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>PRIDE will lead to substantial benefits across a wide range of stakeholders including the scientific and public health communities, policy makers, commissioners and service planners, the voluntary sector, carers, people with dementia, service providers, and international organisations. Initial benefits: 

(a) better public and scientific understanding of the social and cultural impact of dementia, the role of lifestyle factors, and the impact on the changes in cognition and activities of daily living across time; the associated economic and social benefits; the potential impact on the future prevalence of dementia. 

(b) improved public health guidance on lifestyle approaches to reduce risk of dementia (eg physical exercise, cognitive stimulation), and updated policy and practice (eg updated NICE guidelines, update of National Dementia Strategy, and commissioning guidance). 

(c) better public understanding of lifestyle and social factors in dementia should lead to reduced fear and stigma, and a more proactive approach to seeking help by people worried about their memory and their families. 

(d) The programme could within 5 years provide the evidence required to demonstrate to managers and policy makers that the intervention was effective, leading to changes in the way older peoples' services are organised and opportunities for national implementation. This would promote independence and quality of life, and reduce service use for people with dementia and their carers. The applicants' networks and the key drivers to influence policy means there could be extensive implementation of the social intervention by memory services across the UK. 


Future benefits: 

(e) if as expected the social intervention leads to improvements in independence, activities of daily living and quality of life this should translate into major economic benefits (eg reduced costs of care) addressing the key policy concern of improved resource use through innovation in a time of economic stringency. Societal benefits will also accrue for people with dementia (and their carers) who will be able to retain their independence for longer and experience reduced stigma about the condition. 

(f) Services across the UK and Europe use information and support interventions and because of the comprehensive approach including a major trial and implementation study, the social intervention could rapidly become widely used, as a clinical/cost-effective, standardised, and feasible intervention providing effective and better targeted support and information at an early stage. We will network with other countries to encourage them to translate and evaluate the intervention aiming for 5 major languages within 3 years of completion. Countries with the capability to adopt the intervention quickly include the Netherlands and Australia. We will explore the feasibility of the intervention in Brazil, India and China in the context of different cultures and health systems. 

(g) There is potential for major policy impact in Europe and elsewhere. The INTERDEM network includes 20 European Nations, has close links with the European Commission and Alzheimer Europe. This means it is in an excellent position to promote and disseminate the findings and influence EU policy.

(h) The INTERDEM Academy will have an international impact improving dementia care by fostering research collaboration, improving knowledge exchange and developing junior researchers. We will build on the successful cohort of researchers coming through major grant programmes led by the applicants (eg SHIELD, iCST, VALID - the PI also has 7 PhD students) programmes, and other major studies from the UK and the wider INTERDEM community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3402474</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ALzheimer's Disease International (Hungary)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E34616B5-1669-42E6-8ECF-899B8A683333</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Oral presentation about the challenge of being and active citizen following a diagnosis of dementia.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ageing Summit Conference oral presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>10DA886A-4009-4431-B9D6-C0D30DECB18C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of how we found that internet use and physical actcivity can improve quality of life among older adults.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Alzheimer Europe Conference (Slovenia)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8445525A-DA0F-463F-842E-0A965FBC5134</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An oral presentation was made about how to develop a 'self management intervention' for people with dementia in order to help them maintain independence and participations in life.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IAGG-ER conference, Dublin</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>65D118AD-5CFF-4F4C-8B59-656AA2270596</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster was presented about the fear of tha diagnosis of dementia.

Also in those people over 50, those with higher socioeconomic position, better quality of life, vigorous physical activity, paid work, digital literacy, and cultural leisure activities had significantly lower risk impairment in their daily activities. Computer-based cognitive interventions have moderate effects in cognition, depression and anxiety in persons with dementia. We have found a wide range of measures of positive factors within psychology (such as resilience or autonomy) identified as having potential utility for psychosocial research within a dementia population. 

We have also finished recruitment on our qualitative work and are doing our follow up interviews, as well as the observations. The data is transcribed and written up and the team meet regularly to discuss how they are analysing the data. We have developed a paper based manual for the intervention for the feasibility study. We have recruited five sites, and are currently recruiting participants, the first of whom have already completed the intervention, baseline and follow up assessments. All feedback so far has been positive. We are also recording fidelty to the intervention, the checklists have been returned to us from both the provider of the intervention and the participants, and recordings of the intervention session (to further investigate fidelity) are being sent to us for analysis. We are also developing a web based version of the intervention.

We are working with the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit to develop a test database for the feasibility study with the view that the database will then be able to be modified for use in the RCT.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings contribute to the development of a social intervention that will be used in the eventual RCT.
