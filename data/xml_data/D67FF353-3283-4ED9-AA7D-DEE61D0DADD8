With the availability of various advanced devices (e.g., smart phones, tablet pc, mobile gaming terminals), the demands of low-cost and large-scale interactive multimedia content delivery will become a key feature of next generation wireless networks. The primary requirement for these services is the sustained transmission of high quality data at high rates across large scale areas, comprising a set of strict criteria in terms of short delays, small delay jitter, and high throughput under changing wireless communication conditions. 

Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are a disruptive technology that will be an alternative to existing mobile wireless architectures for low-cost multimedia communications in large scale outdoor environments. However, the fundamental drawbacks (e.g., limited bandwidth, wireless transmission interference and conflict) inherent in the wireless transmission medium make it a challenge to deploy WMNs to carry high-performance multimedia communications in large-scale areas. Integrated communications that combine the Internet and wireless networks were provided to solve the scalability problem. Current studies focus on single-source integrated multimedia communications and will cause a set of problems such as heavy overheads, complicated data distribution processes and complexity in maintaining the architectures for multiple communications if being used for interactive multimedia communications, due to multiple concurrent senders of interactive multimedia content generating a heavier and more complicated traffic load for wireless networks to manage. 

This project, as a part of the initial work on large-scale and low-cost wireless interactive multimedia communications, will study advanced algorithms/protocols and theorems for optimally integrating the Internet and WMNs which will efficiently meet wired and wireless integration requirements for transmissions from multiple interactive sources. To tackle this difficult problem progressively, three major tasks are planned. We will first study the extension of performance-guaranteed wireless transmission environments which will avoid the overuse of the Internet and backhaul access resources via mesh gateways and therefore the scalability of integrated communications. The study will be implemented by exploring the advantages provided by multiple transmission rates and multiple transmission channels. We will then study an integrated architecture for multiple interactive sources. This study will be based on the investigation of multimedia transmission performance in multi-rate multi-channel WMNs and the discussion of the impact of mesh gateways on the performance of integrated communications. Finally, we will study the proposed architecture in theory. We will provide a mathematical model that can reflect the advanced technology arising from this project. We will justify the proposed integrated architecture through solid theoretical performance analysis. 

The research proposed in the project is believed to among the first to consider large-scale affordable interactive multimedia communications any time and anywhere for the general public. It is now commonly accepted by most industry players that multimedia communications act like a gateway to a whole new communication world. This project thus will not only aid the UK in keeping its world-leading position in telecommunications but will also be attractive for commercial exploitation in the near future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Apart from the academic beneficiaries, this project will have the following major non-academic beneficiaries: telecommunication companies, government organisations, medical health centres, and others. 

- Telecommunications companies. The research outcomes arising from this project will benefit telecommunication companies in the deployment of next generation telecommunication networks for low-cost and scalable wireless multimedia applications. Economical multimedia services any time and anywhere may be a major motivation for network users to pay for a high-speed wireless broadband connection. This surely represents a new revenue opportunity. The potential sales will produce direct economic benefits for the UK and beyond.

- Government organisations. It was emphasized in President Obama's economic stimulus plan that government IT organizations should optimize their networks: this dictum applies equally to the UK. The proposed research will facilitate the delivery of video/audio information technology to improve the transparency and efficiency of different governmental bodies. For example (as mentioned in the proposal), Liverpool City Council budget meetings are to be webcast so electors can follow the discussions as the council decides on its budget for 2012/13. This research will make it even easier for citizens to access such services. Other examples include the remote parking information, traffic management systems, etc.

- Medical health centres. With low-cost and large-scale multimedia communication technology, remote diagnoses will become popular which will benefit urgent medical cases, especially for those cases which require doctors to be able to receive examination results (e.g., x-ray pictures). These benefits will undoubtedly improve quality of life.

- Other beneficiaries. The research will provide a scalable wireless backbone for multimedia content delivery in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs are a popular technology used to develop cutting-edge services for different industries such as energy exploration, the study of wild animals, smart homes, etc.

- Glyndwr University. The University is keen to further strengthen its research profile. The project itself and the involved impact activities will support the University in many different ways: high-impact research, achieving research funding, interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge transfer activities.

To transfer the project knowledge to the above beneficiaries, the project plans a number of various outreach efforts. (For details please refer to the &amp;quot;Pathways to Impact&amp;quot;.) 

- Organise presentations to the targeted IT-related and non-IT-related audience. 

- Publish our research achievements in high impact journals targeted at both academia and industry, as well as those that are relevant to industrial/commerical actors. 

- Create and maintain a website specifically for this project at least one year longer than the project's life time. 

- Attend public affairs activities to promote this research to the general public and local small to medium sized companies. 

- Utilise existing international collaboration as a channel for the dissemination of this project and so enhance its international impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51596</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4A4DB32-74B3-4BC6-B507-0460F39E8BC1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 20 researchers and students in total to RGU for the presentations, which sparked questions and discussion afterwards to explore any collaboration opportunities.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Local government visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>96B1BB12-BE47-489E-BD0F-D50DFA53C8D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visited the local government (Aberdeenshire) to discuss the potential project on deploying modern network management based on the results achieved from this project.

1. Large-scale communication architecture for multi-source multimedia communications. This research presents a high-performance communication architecture for interactive multimedia content (e.g., 3D virtual worlds, immersive
environments, the interactive streaming of
rich sensor feeds, mobile online gaming) delivery potentially across states. 

2. Efficient channel utilization. Being one of the first on multi-flow multicast in wireless mesh networks, the research presents two flow management policies by a set of theoretical analyses using Network Calculus, ameliorating the trade-off between limited channel resources and increasing multi-flow transmissions. The theoretical policies are practiced by a new multi-flow multicast algorithm, efficiently achieving additional transmission opportunity (&amp;gt;50% based on simulation studies) even when channels are considered &amp;quot;saturated&amp;quot; in conventional transmission models.

3. Multi-channel multi-rate multimedia multicast. This research developed novel schemes to explore the combinational advantages of multiple channels and multiple rates in addressing the fast performance degradation of multimedia communications in WMNs. Multimedia multicast coverage with guaranteed throughput is extended via multihop WMNs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The developed studies are believed to directly benefit academic researchers in networking by providing 1) algorithm/protocol references and experience for studying future multimedia content delivery and advanced wireless technology; 2) new theorems provide a benchmark for continuous study. 

Information technology arising from this project will make possible new practical applications for many other disciplines such as medicine, zoology, modern urban management, public security, mass communications, etc. For example, it will facilitate emergency remote diagnosis of medical problems, or the remote monitoring of wildlife, etc.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7AC7222C-F779-46B2-B50B-B7B54326F832</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including
