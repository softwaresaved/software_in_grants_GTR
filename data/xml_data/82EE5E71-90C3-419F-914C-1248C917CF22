By presenting the results of the research through an online database, published articles and an exhibition at the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum, the project will broaden the way the medium is seen and understood and contribute new methods of approaching art practice.\n\nBetween the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Festival of Britain in 1951, sculptural activity was transformed by urban expansion, the growth of teaching institutions, museums and exhibiting societies, changing attitudes to art and craft, and, above all, the emergence of modernism. Yet there has been no authoritative study of this century of change and information on less than 14% of the estimated 3,000-3,500 sculptors and 1% of the 900-1,100 art related businesses and trades active in this period is contained in standard works of reference. By conducting a systematic survey and creating records on c.6,000 sculptors and organisations 'Mapping Sculpture 1851-1951' will give researchers access to a wealth of data dispersed in numerous libraries and archives.\n\nThis project takes an innovative approach to the research that moves beyond the conventional image of the sculptor as the sole creator of handcrafted works and reveals the uniquely collaborative nature of the sculptural medium. 'Mapping Sculpture 1851-1951' reassesses the status and roles of related businesses and trades, such as studio assistants, carvers and art metalworkers, by exploring their contributions to the creative process. The role of personal and institutional networks in supporting art practice is re-evaluated, particularly the partnerships between sculptors and architects. A significant portion of sculpture from this period falls outside accepted critical hierarchies: monumental, ideal or abstract. The study reconsiders the full range of sculptors' practices to throw new light on responses to changing patterns of consumption. In order to develop a deeper understanding of the geography of sculptural practice and the relationship between the metropolis and the regions, the project will make an inegtrated study of sculpture in Britain and Ireland. \n\nThese methods, supported by a fully relational database and a powerful search engine, will reveal the complex web of relationships between sculptors, associated businesses, professional colleagues, objects, organizations and places. This is a new way of looking at the practice and profession of sculpture that will create the foundation for numerous studies in art history and visual culture, including critical analyses of networks of production and explorations of real and imagined communities of consumers.\n \n'Mapping Sculpture 1851-1951' is a partnership venture between the University of Glasgow, the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum and the Henry Moore Institute. The project builds on Feasibility and Pilot Studies carried out between 2004-06 with funding from the Trustees of the Henry Moore Foundation. The main project survey will be carried out in seventeen locations across Britain and Ireland selected to yield data on 80% of sculptural activity in the period. \n \nBy delivering the results of the research through a free access online database with contextual essays and an exhibition at the V&amp;amp;A, 'Mapping Sculpture 1851-1951' will ensure knowledge transfer to the broadest audience and serve as an invaluable aid to art historians and theorists, curators and heritage workers, the wider education sector and the general public. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>854248</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>an exhibition of 32 objects from the V&amp;amp;A in the Gilbert Bayes Gallery, Room 111 open to the public free admission</gtr:description><gtr:id>7EA0F830-9774-4B88-938C-CDEE425CF464</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Disseminating the material basis of the projects 'Mapping Sculpture' and 'Mobilising Mapping' to the public through a designated display over a period of 6 months at the V&amp;amp;A</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Mapping Sculpture an exhibition of 32 objects at the V&amp;A, in the Gilbert Bayes Gallery, Room 111 which lasted from 12 November 2010 - 15 May 2011.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Art UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>'Your Sculpture'</gtr:description><gtr:id>42961D8F-FA95-4F10-94B1-A0CD2F92A672</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There are no formal outputs or outcomes from this collaboration at the development stage.

Indeed since the project's official launch in May 2011, there have been over 1.25 million page visits (1,287,050). Evidence from people working in academic departments, art galleries and museums, and the heritage sector indicates that the site is used on a daily basis for reference purposes by professional colleagues. It is also consulted by a wide range of other people such as those engaged in family history research, local history studies (including those investigating the history of war memorials and local public monuments, graves etc.) as well as those who own sculptures, medals and other decorative objects which they wish to understand more fully. 

Over the last decade there has been an explosion of interest globally in local and family history facilitated by sites such as ancestry.com (launched 2002) and popularised by television series like Who Do You Think You Are? (which attracts audiences of over 6 million in the UK alone). The c.3,900 emails received by the project from the public providing feedback about the site and content have demonstrated Mapping Sculpture's value and importance for this growing community of historians. Feedback received since the database launch in 2011 has amply tested and validated the academic advantages of Mapping Sculpture's methodology.

Annual visitor figures to the site remained strong in 2016-17 - there were 190,755 page views from 76,576 users (according to Google Analytics). The overwhelming majority of visitors (87.43%) find the site through search engines. Of those visits that originated from a link on another website, most came from Wikipedia. Around two-thirds of people using the site were based in the UK, with the remaining third visiting it from 160 countries around the world with particularly strong interest in the USA, Canada, Australia, Ireland, France, New Zealand, and Germany. The scope of visitor figures reflects the international reach of sculptors and businesses through immigration and overseas activities. Many of the overseas enquiries addressed to the project concern practitioners who emigrated to other countries or whose descendants have moved abroad.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8421D8C4-3315-4ABB-BBB3-19C8E89AA5B3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Mapping Sculpture is a free access online database delivering the first authoritative and comprehensive view of sculptural practice between the Great Exhibition and the Festival of Britain.
