Fluids, in this case air, are generally regarded as exhibiting two states of flow - a 'laminar' state and a 'turbulent' state. Turbulence is characterised by chaotic variations in the direction of the flow, through the appearance of whirls or 'eddies'. In industrial applications, turbulence typically leads to a loss of performance, as significant energy can be lost to the generation of eddies. A typical example is in pipelines, important for domestic water supply, irrigation, cooling systems, oil and gas supply. Rather than energy being expended in moving fluid directly from A to B, almost all the energy is lost to the creation and sustenance of turbulence! The question of how to model turbulence, therefore, is consistently listed among the most important outstanding problems of applied mathematics and theoretical physics 
(e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics). 

This work builds on recent progress in understanding turbulence, made possible by the recent discovery of solutions to the equations governing flow in pipes and channels. These solutions are in the form of waves. Although they travel with the flow, their structure is otherwise static in time. Turbulence is chaotic in time, however. A radical step-change in this approach will be to model turbulence in terms of solutions that vary in time and that repeat after a period of time. Substantially new computational methods will be required to isolate such solutions in the future. There is strong motivation for isolating repeating cycles, otherwise called periodic orbits - from dynamical systems theory they are known to efficiently capture complex dynamics, filtering out activity that is otherwise a distraction. Often only a handful of periodic orbits are required to reproduce the statistical properties of a seemingly complex system.

By extracting periodic orbits directly from simulations of turbulence itself, this project aims to capture those periodic orbits that are dynamically most important. So far it has only been possible to find orbits via numerical continuation methods, where there is no clear link between the orbits and the actual dynamics of the system. Capturing periodic cycles in a 'large' system such as turbulence, however, has been a challenging task. In this work, a new symmetry projection method will be developed to enable meaningful visualisations of the underlying dynamics. It has been shown that this particular method dramatically improves our ability to spot recurring cycles, i.e. periodic orbits. Collaboration with a leading European experimental facility will enable further application of these methods, plus theoretically guided searches to be performed more rapidly than is possible in simulation.

This work will have great impact on our understanding of dynamical processes underlying turbulence, where periodic orbits will provide a basis for describing and predicting fluid flow patterns. This will open new avenues of future research in methods of prediction and control.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is of a fundamental mathematical nature, and therefore impact on industry is likely to be indirect, via academic impact on applied disciplines. Examples of research areas that have already taken an interest in the techniques being developed in fundamental fluid dynamics include complex fluids and magnetohydrodynamics. 

The symmetry reduction method is currently being developed for applications as diverse as rotating flows and cardiac dynamics. There are wide range of target areas for applications of symmetry reductions methods, from industrial processes to the life sciences. The spatial evolution of chemical fronts and models of predator-prey interactions are specific target examples.

Turbulence is familiar to the majority of people through commercial flights, and the question of how to model turbulence is consistently listed among the top outstanding issues in applied mathematics and theoretical physics. This public familiarity makes turbulence a topic well suited to public engagement. The specific subject matter of the project, and recent developments based on dynamical systems, makes extensive use of easy-to-interpret phase diagrams, schematic and from data. There is a substantial visual element, which is again suited to outreach. This research will benefit the interested general public through a number of public engagement channels.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65921</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Georgia Institute of Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>GeorgiaTech</gtr:description><gtr:id>8DB632CE-B260-4E3C-93B7-6FEC30E2031E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have developed code that implements the 'method of slices' (a 'symmetry-reduction' method) that is essential for visualisation of the dynamical system of turbulence.

We have searched and identified periodic orbits without the artificial rotational symmetry that is routinely used in simulation. 

We find that the type of orbits that tend to dominate in these more realistic domains have multiple frequencies, including long period oscillations. These render the standard techniques for identifying orbits, via recurrences, in effective. An approach that alleviates this difficulty has been proposed.

The methods is a fundamental mathematical tool, and is applicable to applications as diverse as fluid flows and cardiac dynamics. 
I have recently been consulted on how to apply these 
methods to population dynamics in mathematical ecology.

In the current research, these methods have been adapted and in particular, shown that they be applied even to 'large' dynamical systems, here the case of a turbulent flow. Many repeating patterns that underlie the dynamics were extracted than has previously been possible, and 
relationships between families of repeating patterns identified.

As turbulence is familiar to many people through commercial flight, the notion that turbulent flow is chaotic is easily understood. Our research has shown that this chaotic dynamics can be explained in terms of just a few sets of repeating patterns, and this has been conveyed 
through public speaking (e.g. Cafe Scientifique).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>226DDE88-1909-4F47-ABDF-4ABCBBF80D41</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The 'method of slices' has been developed to automatically remove the
redundant freedom of spatial shifts of a pattern in fluid flow. 
Patterns that are 
identical up to a shift are automatically reduced to a single state that
lives within a reduced space, the 'slice'. Sliced dynamics reveals dynamically important features, such as recurring periodic orbits, that 
are otherwise impossible to visualise.

Determining shifts using multiple templates has proven difficult, as there 
are innumerable options in how and when to apply the switch between 
templates. With appropriate manipulation, however, it has been shown
that it is possible to implement the symmetry reduction with a single
template. Features of the symmetry reduction, e.g. rapid changes in 
shift, have been explained in terms of properties of the projection onto
the slice.

Using the refined method, it has been possible to isolate many more 
orbits direct from simulation data than in any previous study. Through 
visualisation of the state space, it has been found that orbits may be grouped into distinct families.

It has proven difficult, so far, to get sufficiently good quality 
experimental data from which to extract orbits. Another source of 
difficulty is associated with the much larger domain -- we have identified
that orbits exhibiting multiple frequencies dominate. This renders
identification via standard recurrence plots ineffective. Nevertheless,
if the shortest frequency can be identified, 
it has been shown possible to extract whole families of related solutions
from segments of trajectories, despite that recurrence plots would 
suggest no candidates for periodic orbits.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key development is in the very general method. This has been shown to enable vastly improved visualisation of paths taken by a chaotic dynamical system, and thereby can be employed to reveal its fundamental features, e.g. its dominant periodic orbits.

Beyond fluid flow, the method is directly applicable to any system that includes a homogeneous direction. This includes e.g. population models in ecology, models of fronts in chemical processes, models of cardiac dynamics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FE447C3A-273C-4AD5-8A22-C7A95A87B0DC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.openpipeflow.org/index.php?title=Periodic_orbits</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A simulation code and documentation on techniques and methods are provided.
