It will bring together for the first time the world's biggest datasets about published sheet music, music manuscripts and classical concerts (in excess of 5 million records) for statistical analysis, manipulation and visualisation. 

Data from seven existing databases and catalogues will be used as the basis of this project. These datasets (two of which are not currently available online) include: the British Library's catalogues of printed and manuscript music; the bibliographies created by R&amp;eacute;pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) that list European music printed 1500-1800 and music manuscripts in European libraries; and the RISM UK Music Manuscripts Database and the Concert Programmes Project database. These catalogues and databases are already essential finding tools for all researchers of music history and musicology, plus many scholars of performance studies and cultural history. However, until now it has not been possible to analyse these rich collections of data for large-scale trends in the dissemination of music, the popularity of specific composers, or the development of musical taste. 

Our project will align and combine the seven datasets so that they can be analysed as big data. Key areas of the British Library data will be enriched and cleaned in order that they can be successfully aligned with the other datasets. The project team will then pilot ways in which the combined dataset can be analysed with approaches taken from the study of big data. By analysing the frequency, spread and distribution of specific compositions and composers' outputs, the project will challenge current thinking about how music was transmitted across borders, how musical taste developed, and how certain composers or repertories were canonised as carrying aesthetic value. The results of this research will be disseminated via a symposim held at the British Library, to which academics and non-academics will be invited. Finally, the data will be made available as an open dataset for researchers to undertake big data research across multiple disciplines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main non-academic beneficiaries of this project are:
1. Librarians and information management professionals, particularly those specialising in music or in big data
2. Professional and amateur musicians involved in the performance of European music from the 16th to 20th centuries
3. Members of the general public interested in the history of European music
4. Students and teachers exploring the history of European music

The project will benefit the above groups by:
1. Demonstrating new ways of using and analysing the metadata held by European music libraries
2. Helping professional performers find new repertories for performance, by exploring the dataset with the various analysis and visualisation tools (e.g. to find repertory for a concert programme centred on musical life in a particular geographic centre, or on musical responses to a historic event)
3. Posing new narratives for the history of music, shifting attention away from familiar repertory to the 'Great Unheard' musicians
4. Showing students and teachers new ways to engage with music history via digital technology

The project will achieve these benefits by means of:
1. The one-day Symposium held at the British Library in March 2015, which will be open to the general public (no registration fee required) and will be advertised to the extensive mailing list of library users held by the British Library's Music department, as well as via the Readers' Bulletin sent to all British Library readers. Like other events held at the British Library, this event will appeal to the Library's wide user base that includes professional performers, media professionals, amateur musicians, members of the general public, and students and teachers. 
2. Blogposts at http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/music/, to update the public on the project's progress.
3. The open dataset, downloadable by anyone anywhere, so they can investigate and analyse it as a form of citizen science. The online tutorial will provide a jargon-free explanation of how to use and manipulate the open dataset. 
4. Co-I Tuppen's paper at the conference of the International Association of Music Libraries (Antwerp, July 2014), which will publicise the project to librarians and information management professionals, and gain their feedback at an early stage of the project's development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79231</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Digital Music Lab 1st Workshop on Analysing Big Music Data</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD27CA01-B3CB-4715-B9CB-D8213CAB83BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>60 researchers attended workshop on analysing music as Big Data, which sparked questions and discussion afterwards

(a) Non-academic institutions such as libraries and museums considering making their catalogue and database records available as open data, encouraging new ways of public engagement with their collections
(b) Non-academics including citizen scientists engaging with music history via the use of big data. The hackathon and study day held at the British Library in March 2015 showed the public interest in such approaches. 
(c) Building new bridges between music academia and data scientists / technologists, acting as a template for further collaborations

As an example of impact (a), librarians and information professionals have been inspired to consider how their own library databases might be analysed as Big Data. Anna Penseart, music librarian at Cambridge University, blogged after our project presentation in Antwerp:
'I think it's fantastic that in the world of Digital Humanities it is now possible to take data that was primarily created as a bibliographical tool and use this for research using a range of technologies, statistics and visualisations. It just struck me how labour intensive (if not completely impossible) this would have been in the good old days when I was a musicology student and feel very impressed indeed. The actual process of cleaning up the data in order to make research possible sounded absolutely fascinating.' (http://iamlukirl.wordpress.com/tag/iaml-antwerp/, accessed 22 October 2014 )

As evidence of impact (b), the hackathon and study day in March 2015 were attended by over 20 non-academic users including staff from museums (e.g. Foundling Museum, London; Horniman Museum, London) and continental organisations (e.g. DANS, the Dutch Data and Networking Service; Repertoire International des Sources Musicales, Switzerland). These attendees explored the data made available by the project and the methods of data cleaning and visualisation. According to feedback collected at the events, 73% of attendees intended to use the project datasets available at http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html, and
73% of attendees intended to use the research methods demonstrated in the sessions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A4043D4E-07E4-4683-A071-EB282651F48B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research project has shown that the world's biggest datasets about published sheet music and music manuscripts can be brought together for statistical analysis, manipulation and visualisation.
