These precursors will themselves have been made from simpler precursors and so on, but every chemical synthesis ultimately has to have a starting material or materials. These starting materials come from natural sources, either petrochemical feedstocks or biomolecules such as carbohydrates, amino acids, etc. Some of these constitute the chiral pool , meaning they have defined 3D structures that make them ideal for the rapid construction of molecules of high spatial complexity (as is the case for many drugs). Unfortunately, not all possible 3D structures are available in the chiral pool. The core of our proposal is to augment the chiral pool by producing a library of new chiral starting materials that will enable the synthesis of complex molecules that have thus far been inaccessible. We will do this by using a particular strain of bacteria, which has been bred for its ability to carry out a chemical reaction for which there is no man-made equivalent available. Specifically, the bacteria can carry out an oxidation to metabolise aromatic compounds, cheap starting materials which are not in the chiral pool, since they are flat. The compounds so produced *are* chiral, however, so significant value is added in a single step, especially since a small bacterial culture can process a large quantity of aromatic starting material. The synthetic utility of this approach has been demonstrated by several groups in the last twenty years, but the range of microbially-derived building blocks available is restricted by the selectivity of the enzymes that produce them (they only process certain aromatic compounds and they only give certain products). Hence, we propose a tandem chemoenzymatic approach - taking the products of bacterial metabolism and subjecting them to short, robust, high-yielding chemical syntheses that will provide wholly novel building blocks that are not available through bacterial metabolism alone. This approach carries several advantages from a sustainability perspective - using bacteria to do synthesis is possible at or near room temperature, so energy requirements are minimal. Also, the oxidant used is simply oxygen from the air, so no toxic heavy metals are required.We have numerous applications in mind for the building blocks we will produce. For example, we will be able to use them to synthesise novel derivatives of inositols, a type of molecule which has recently shown promise as a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, from the same building blocks, we will be able to synthesise new azasugars. These are compounds which can interact with glycosidase enzymes in the body. Glycosidases are involved in many diseases, and many current top-selling drugs are azasugars, including Tamiflu and Relenza for influenza, Glucobay and Basen for diabetes and Zavesca for Tay-Sach's disease. We therefore expect our library of new chiral building blocks ultimately to pave the way for the synthesis of new drug candidates for the treatment of various diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed work will engender benefits for many stakeholders. The synthetic community will have the opportunity to employ the building blocks we are proposing to develop, both in academic and industrial settings. We envisage such an impact having a medium-term timescale (in the years after completion of the work). Synthetic chemistry underpins the pharmaceutical industry, a sector in which the UK is a world leader and our work has the potential to contribute to the continued pre-eminence of the UK in drug discovery and development. The fact that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson have employed a closely related building block in a drug discovery programme (see ref 44) attests to the likely usefulness of our work in a pharmaceutical context. It follows from this that there is potential for significant human health benefit - a major beneficiary of the work would be patients receiving any drug whose development had incorporated our technology; we expect such impact would be realised in the longer term. In order to be able to access benefits from our work, stakeholders must be made aware of our research. Effective, widespread dissemination is therefore of key importance. In the first instance we will undertake this by traditional means - we will publish our work in high impact journals. All of these are read by a wide audience from chemistry and allied disciplines and will serve to communicate our work to a greater spectrum of potential beneficiaries than pure organic chemistry journals. Subsequent to publication, we intend also to write a review article on the subject of microbial arene oxidation in which our work will be highlighted. In addition, the University of Bath has recently established an Online Publication Store (OPUS), in which we will deposit our data. Both the PI and PDRA will also promote the work through giving talks and presenting posters at prestigious, well-attended conferences. The concept of using bacteria to do synthesis is highly attractive from a sustainability/environmental standpoint and as such likely to be of interest to a large proportion of the public. There are many appropriate forums for public engagement, for example the Bath Science Caf, a monthly event at which scientists are able to present their work in an accessible format for the general public. In addition, the university runs a well-attended annual event, Bath Taps Into Science , in which we will participate. To engage larger numbers of people, it will be necessary to generate interest in the lay media; to this end, the University of Bath has a dedicated press office to assist in the preparation of press releases, etc., whose services we will engage. The University of Bath has several resources at the disposal of its researchers to aid them in the exploitation of their research to the greatest degree possible. There is a specific fund (the Sulis fund) to enable staff to exploit their work in a commercial context and I will draw on this resource if appropriate. In addition, we will liaise with Bath Ventures, an organisation that was established to maximise the return on the University's intellectual property for the benefit of both the University and society at large. Bath Ventures has a legal &amp;amp; IP team who are able to advise on preparation of patent applications, licensing and collaborative agreements, etc. It should be noted that the University has an excellent track record of launching chemistry-related spin-out companies. The PI will be primarily responsible for impact activities, although the PDRA will also undertake specific impact activities. Drafts of publications will be prepared jointly and to facilitate this, the PDRA will be able to attend the annual scientific writing workshop held in the department.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>87828</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>19964</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>HEIF Funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>55A83B91-9DFD-4381-BB63-EF12CCA58780</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Impact Acceleration Account - Feasibility Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/K503897/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>300624D3-5176-4B6D-A876-8BD70F702D81</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>19964</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>HEIF Funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D9C43749-2A5B-4184-B775-E9071C4CAB74</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project concerned the use of bacteria to carry out chemical reactions that would be impossible by normal lab-based chemical methods. Specifically, we have used bacteria that can take an &amp;quot;aromatic&amp;quot; compound and oxidise it to install two extra oxygen atoms. Aromatic compounds are normally very stable and hard to alter in this way. However, the molecule produced by the bacteria is no longer aromatic, so can be reacted in many different ways - it is a versatile &amp;quot;building block&amp;quot; to use for further chemical transformations into many different final products.



We wanted to make this building block even more useful by transforming it into a whole library of different building blocks (never synthesised before), which could in turn be used to access an even bigger variety of final products, such as potential new drugs. A problem with this idea is that although the first building block is indeed very versatile, it is also fragile - e.g. it is easily destroyed upon heating, or upon exposure to acid. The key idea of our work was that we could overcome this fragility by temporarily &amp;quot;protecting&amp;quot; the building block with by attaching it to an atom of iron. The chemical properties of iron mean that in this case it acts like an umbrella, shielding the building block from the harsh chemical conditions needed to do chemistry at it's edges. Once the necessary chemical modifications have been completed, the iron can easily be removed, giving the desired new modified building blocks. Of the various ways the original building block could be &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot;, using iron has several advantages, not least that it is cheap, non-toxic and there are no concerns over its

future supply (unlike many metals).



This key concept was highly successful and we were able to produce new building blocks by this method. We showcased the utility of these new building blocks by using them to synthesise some significant and useful final products. Specifically, we undertook the total synthesis of five natural products. &amp;quot;Natural products&amp;quot; refers to molecules found in nature and &amp;quot;total synthesis&amp;quot; means recreating these in the lab. A common motivation for this is if a natural product has been identified which has useful characteristics (e.g. medicinal properties), but is only available from the natural source in tiny quantities. Larger quantities would be needed to investigate its biological activites, or to develop it as a drug, so total synthesis is performed. Our new building blocks are ideal for the synthesis of polyoxygenated cyclohexenes - natural products isolated from various tropical flowers found in SE Asia. Some of these have been shown to kill cancer cells, but lack of material has hampered further study (many kilos of plant material give only a few milligrams of natural product). Using our novel building blocks, we have carried out very short, efficient syntheses of some of these natural products. We have recently published this and in future work we will partner with biologists working in this area to evaluate these compounds as disease treatments.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>x</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>18311869-BB6E-4AC6-988C-18A4BC692EB2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2B93986E-1EAA-4D2D-8F5F-9E8F0A715241"><gtr:id>2B93986E-1EAA-4D2D-8F5F-9E8F0A715241</gtr:id><gtr:title>Total synthesis of (+)-grandifloracin by iron complexation of a microbial arene oxidation product.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organic letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2185536297b2b0f426a99b4fb3336e91"><gtr:id>2185536297b2b0f426a99b4fb3336e91</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Palframan MJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1523-7052</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/41CEA9B4-E1B0-46DD-B01F-82AFBAFC653B"><gtr:id>41CEA9B4-E1B0-46DD-B01F-82AFBAFC653B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Photooxygenation of a microbial arene oxidation product and regioselective Kornblum-DeLaMare rearrangement: total synthesis of zeylenols and zeylenones.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2185536297b2b0f426a99b4fb3336e91"><gtr:id>2185536297b2b0f426a99b4fb3336e91</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Palframan MJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0947-6539</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H049355/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A097DA61-EABD-4142-9025-D4EA5CA63082</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Co-ordination Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
