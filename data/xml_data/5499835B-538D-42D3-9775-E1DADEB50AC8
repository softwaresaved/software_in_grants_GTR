It pays particular attention to the influence of family life and the pressures of civilian employment on the decisions that reservists make about their commitment to serving and intentions to remain in the Reserves, because the Army is becoming increasingly reliant on reservists at a time when changes to employment patterns and family life may also be placing greater pressure on reservists.

Since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, more than 27,000 reservists have been used in military operations. Though the Army has relied more and more on volunteer reserves, their numbers have declined sharply over the last two decades. This is significant, because planned reforms of size and structure of the British Army mean that the Army has been tasked with significantly increasing the size of the Reserves to make up for personnel and capability shortfalls, resulting from current and future defence cuts. Although some politicians have suggested that recruiting and retaining more reservists is about fostering greater understanding of and support for the military in wider society, the everyday economic and social challenges that reservists face in balancing their military service with civilian jobs and family life need to be considered in more depth. There have not been any prior major British studies analysing these issues specifically among reservists.

The Army's increased reliance on reservists has also come at a time when families may be under increased financial pressure due to recession, inflation and social spending cuts. Though this may motivate some people to join the Reserves to earn additional money, reserve service has to be balanced with other roles. One of these is roles within the family itself. Many families, either with or without children, rely on two incomes which can make childcare, other family care commitments and housework harder to balance with commitments outside of the home. Another is civilian employment which the majority of reservists are engaged in, where there has been a growth of evening and weekend working and the rise of a long-hours working culture. These family and employment issues are likely to influence the ability of reservists to commit to the Army and to carry on serving in the Reserves. In order to ascertain what reservists think about balancing competing role commitments and demands and how this might affect their reserve service, this project focuses on their perceptions and experiences and those of their families.

By observing reservists during Reserve training exercises and by interviewing them and members of their families, we will provide in-depth insights into how reservists and their families perceive and experience the potential challenges of reserve service for family life and civilian employment. We will also be able to examine how and why reservists think that their commitment to the Army may be influenced by their competing roles and pressures. The research is likely to have important implications for the Army's plans to restructure, because it will identify key issues that affect the reservist's commitment to the Army. It will also be valuable to reservists themselves and their families because it will help them to consider how they and other reservists cope with competing demands on their time. Finally, the research will offer insights into wider social change in relation to defence, families and employment that will raise important questions about the nature of modern British society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project's findings will provide a significant contribution to the policy considerations surrounding the implementation of Army 2020, benefiting the Army and the MOD, reservists, their families, and family support and welfare organisations. 

The Army will benefit through a greater understanding of how reservists' organisational commitment may be optimised and will thus be able to take measures to improve historically poor reservist retention rates. 

The MOD will profit through a clearer understanding of the long-term sustainability of an integrated and deployable Reserve component. An enhanced understanding of how the work/life balance for reservists may be better achieved will clearly benefit the reservists and their families through better designed, family-friendly reservist support policies. Family support and welfare organisations will benefit from gaining a clear view of the unique challenges facing reservists and their families and will be able to tailor the welfare and support activities offered to reservists. 

Findings will inform not only staffing, welfare and budgetary options for the MOD and the Army, but also other government priorities, particularly in relation to future Comprehensive Spending and Strategic Defence and Security Reviews.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243836</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Academic paper presentation at the Annual Eastern Sociological Society Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A36E5D79-D3E2-42A6-AF18-1D58D2AB54ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented draft paper titled, &amp;quot;Playing at Soldier: Volunteerism and Serious Leisure in the British Army Reserves&amp;quot; and networked with several academics who research on military sociological issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.essnet.org/annual-meeting/overview/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stakeholder Symposium held at the Royal United Services Institute, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>286E965D-4BB6-4433-AC1B-1D0CF617B57C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Victoria Basham (Co-I) and I presented our project's interim research findings and highlighted issues currently affecting reservists in relation to the different aspects of their family, employment and military lives. We also highlighted some of the challenges and opportunities the Army has experienced in its implementation of Future Reserves 2020 in the areas of recruitment, retention, training, welfare and employer engagement. Around sixty delegates attended, many of which were military and Ministry of Defence personnel involved in Reserves policy issues or actual reservists themselves. Several senior figures also attended, including Major General Simon Brooks-Wards, a Reservist and Deputy Field Commander Army, Brigadier Hugh Robertson, Field Army Headquarters; Brigadier Mark Van der Lande, MOD Head of Reserves Forces and Cadets, as well as Hon. Madeleine Moon, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Reserve Forces and Cadets. The intended purpose, beyond sharing interim results, was to raise awareness of the Reservist issues and challenges that Regular military personnel and MOD/political level policy-makers might not be too aware of. The presentation raised several points that were the subject of a healthy, but on occasion acrimonious debate between a few representatives of the Regular and Reserve components of the Army that were present at the symposium. Of particular significance were the interest of the Deputy Commander Field Army as well as of Hon. Madeleine Moon. Maj. Gen. Brooks-Ward invited us to Field Army HQ to interview him and discuss further our results. Hon. Moon invited us to present our findings directly to the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Reserve Forces and Cadets at Portcullis House, Westminster (see All-Party Parliamentary Group for Reserve Forces and Cadets Presentation engagement activity report).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Academic paper presentation at the Biennial Conference of the Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society Canada</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FC9002F0-5F0F-4DD4-818D-DFC7180423F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presentation on co-written paper titled, &amp;quot;Negotiating gender divisions of labour within Army Reservist families and how these influence the balancing of work, family, and Reserve duty commitments&amp;quot; at a specialist academic conference.

Among the attendees were several members of Parliament, including the Minister for Reserves, Rt Hon. Julian Brazier, as well as the Assistant Chief of Defence Staff - Reserves and Cadets, Major General Ranald Munro. Several attendees provided positive feedback on our presentation findings. Minister Brazier corroborated one of our key findings - that training scheduling is still very difficult for Reservists - and admitted that ministerial correspondence had been sent to the MOD seeking explanations on why this was still the case. Members stated that were also interested in getting any future report on our findings, which we have not yet been issued. Hon. Madeleine Moon also stated that she would be open to inviting us to present again at the APPG should we have further findings to present in future.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.glrfca.org/uploads/media_documents/160705gl-sec-mintues-APPG_1480928462.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Project Interim Findings Press Release following presentation at the All Parliamentary Group on Reserves Forces and Cadets, Westminster</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BAB80411-4C26-4944-8F1C-0AB1D13536D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A press release was issued with the assistance of Kerra Maddern, Senior Press and Media Manager, Communication and Marketing Services, University of Exeter on the University of Exeter and Cardiff University websites.
