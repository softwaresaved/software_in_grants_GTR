Many of the most spectacular recent developments in the subject have occurred through the consideration of these aspects in tandem: for example, the duality between symplectic and complex geometry that is mirror symmetry; and the body of work surrounding conjectures of Beilinson, Bloch, and Hodge on the transcendental invariants of generalized algebraic cycles. In previous work, the proposer has found hitherto unknown concrete formulas for the so-called Abel-Jacobi invariants and applied them to explain asymptotic behavior of instanton numbers in local mirror symmetry, as well as to prove new results on cycles themselves.This project will consider novel applications of generalized cycles and their invariants to closely related problems in Hodge theory, string theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry. It will also work out poorly understood aspects of period maps and period domains underlying some of these applications.Specifically, we plan to study several topics which are bound together by Abel-Jacobi invariants and their limits: the boundary behavior of Hodge-theoretic moduli of algebraic varieties (in the context of period domains and limit mixed Hodge structures); applications of cycles to irrationality proofs; and the role played by generalized cycles in homological mirror symmetry and heterotic/type II string duality, with a view to establishing higher algebraic K-theory as a fundamental new tool in theoretical physics. We expect that, in turn, these physics applications will shed light on the mysterious connection between arithmetic and symplectic geometry highlighted by the local mirror symmetry result.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The last two decades have seen a highly productive interaction between Hodge theory, enumerative geometry, and string theory in the mirror symmetry programme, with UK researchers playing a central role. Recent discoveries, including work of the proposer, suggest a new cross-fertilization between theoretical physics and algebraic cycles/K-theory. Our choice of research objectives and our dissemination plans are aimed at maximizing the impact of this project (and of recent advances in transcendental algebraic geometry) on physical methodologies. We envision higher algebraic K-theory and regulators becoming a tool in string theory, deepening its connection with topological K-theory. Furthermore, a small part of the theory of period maps/domains (which our program will further develop) is already used in studies of the holomorphic anomaly equation and of rational conformal field theories. Ultimately it is hoped that the results of this project might contribute to the understanding of black hole entropy (as will be explained below). Our papers with Doran on higher K-theory of toric hypersurfaces and with Pearlstein on normal functions have already been cited in the mainstream (mathematical) physics literature. The concrete dissemination plans envisioned over the period of the grant include many talks (by myself and the postdoc) in interdisciplinary seminars, colloquia, and conferences in the UK and abroad -- which would be facilitated by this grant. The results of the project will be written up in a highly accessible manner (in about 5 papers) and posted on the arXiv. We are planning also to organize two conferences -- one with H. Gangl at Durham on 'Algebraic Cycles and Physics', and one with A. Clingher and C. Doran at Banff (Canada) on 'Hodge Theory and String Duality' -- for Summer 2011, which will be ideal venues to advertise results of this project and exchange ideas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102130</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H021159/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
