The household survey now also includes a new question on the frequency of motor fuel purchases. These changes will considerably reduce the infrequency of purchase problem which affected work based on LCF data in previous survey rounds. This may also feed through to applications such as the RPI and CPI which are based on the LCF. 
2) Our project made available the dataset that we created of estimated consumption-based UK household emissions 2006-2009 with variables for home energy, transport, other consumption and total emissions as well as 71 other sub-categories of emissions. The dataset is publicly accessible and can be merged with detailed information on household characteristics from the EFS/LCF as described in the user manual. It is of use not only to academics but also to public, third sector and private organisations working on household emissions and mitigation policies. The dataset has been applied for research on Personal Carbon Allowances by Martin Burgess, results published in Burgess, M. (2016) 'Personal carbon allowances: A revised model to alleviate distributional issues', Ecological Economics 130: 316-327.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DFBCEE63-B58C-442E-B11B-7A297343171C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project compared the distribution of CO2 emissions across UK households and the association between household characteristics and carbon dioxide emission for home energy, indirect, transport and total emissions. According to our estimate, UK households emitted an average of 20.18 tonnes of CO2 over 2006-9 to which indirect emissions contribute more than 50%. 
Our results also show that different types of household emissions are indeed differently distributed across income and other social groups, including age, household size, presence of children, rural/urban, type of dwelling, gender, education, employment status, home ownership and ethnicity. Generally, transport emissions (flights and public transport in particular) are most unequally distributed, followed by indirect, total and home energy emissions. Relatively high proportions of less well-situated households (e.g. low education, workless, female-headed) also have high home energy emissions. 
Furthermore, we find that household characteristics are associated differently to emissions in different areas. Quantile regression on high emissions indicated that, contrary to our expectation, rural location has a higher positive &amp;quot;effect&amp;quot; on home energy than on transport emissions. Female headed households have significantly lower transport, but significantly higher home energy emissions than male headed households at the high end of the emissions distribution. If we concentrate on poor households with high emissions only, worklessness has a strong negative association and high education a strong positive association with high transport emissions (results published in B&amp;uuml;chs, M. &amp;amp; Schnepf, S. V. (2013) 'Who emits most? Associations between socio-economic factors and UK households' home energy, transport, indirect and total CO2 emissions', Ecological Economics 90: 114-123, which so far received 33 citations on the Web of Science, and 65 on Google scholar)..
All these findings are highly policy relevant as they help identify which emission areas could be targeted most effectively with minimal negative effects on vulnerable households. Modelling distributional implications showed that CO2 taxes have most regressive effects when levied on home energy emissions and least regressive effects if levied on transport. In fact, they were mildly progressive if only applied to flights. Equal per capita rebates reversed regressive effects, but least so for home energy. If allocations to children are included, households with children naturally benefitted but a range of less well-situated households were relatively worse off (published in B&amp;uuml;chs, M., Bardsley, N. &amp;amp; Schnepf, S. (2014) 'Unequal emissions - unequal policy impacts: how do different areas of CO2 emissions compare? ', in T. Fitzpatrick (ed), International Handbook on Social Policy and the Environment. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar. pp. 62-92).

In addition to the originally stated objectives, we also conducted an in-depth examination of methodological choices for studies using expenditure data to estimate household emissions, an under-researched topic so far. First, we compared three different approaches to estimating emissions. We find that different methods generate significantly different results for several areas, particularly for transport emissions, and that converting household expenditure into emissions does not simply replicate findings from research on household expenditure (published in Buchs, M. &amp;amp; Schnepf, S. V. (2013) 'UK households' carbon footprint: a comparison of the association between household characteristics and emissions from home energy, transport and other goods and services'. IZA Discussion Paper No. 7204, Bonn: IZA, available from http://ftp.iza.org/dp7204.pdf). Second, we used data from the National Travel Survey to investigate the extent and implications of the infrequency of purchase problem. This showed that using expenditure rather than mileage data can lead to biases in estimated numbers of winners and losers from climate change mitigation policies due to the range extension that results from infrequency of purchase (Bardsley, N., B&amp;uuml;chs, M. &amp;amp; Schnepf, S. V. (2016) 'Something from Nothing: Estimating Consumption Rates Using Propensity Scores, with Application to Emissions Reduction Policies, Discussion Paper No. 9707'. Bonn: IZA).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results can be used by other researchers to advance modelling of the distribution of household emissions in the UK or other countries.
