The overarching aim of this proposal is the implementation of safe and sustainable energy solutions for lighting, electrification, cooking, heating and cooling, and water and sanitation that promotes development and improves wellbeing in displaced communities, and the associated ICT-based business processes that enable replication and scalability. 

The consortium aims to deliver an innovative research programme to understand how the energy needs of displaced people can be met a safe, sustainable manner. The project seeks to provide research on energy needs in self-settlements, host communities and refugee camps, and understand how sustainable energy solutions can be delivered. Based on this evidence, the consortium will engage a range of energy stakeholders to design and implement sustainable energy solutions. The role of sustainable sources of energy in providing energy services for refugee protection is a critical area for innovation and scale-up. While the focus within refugee camps is often on solar energy (due to the advanced nature of this technology and the natural solar resource available in many developing countries), there are increasing opportunities for the use of renewable biomass and biogas, wind generators, micro-hydro, geothermal, LPG, and waste recycling. Similarly, renewable micro-grids and hybrid systems are often proposed as options for enabling flexible solutions that can be supplied quickly and efficiently in humanitarian emergencies. In addition, the feasibility and ability of low-cost, remote monitoring wireless systems to manage assets and pre-empt operations and maintenance issues of energy infrastructure require further investigation. Digital infrastructure could potentially be created to provide the private sector the assurance it requires to enter this market which has traditionally been the domain of humanitarian actors. All these scientific areas are worthy of research. 

The programme of work will provide energy access to four displaced populations in Rwanda (Kigeme, Nyabiheke, Gihembe refugee camps) and Nepal (Tibet and Bhutan refugees and Kathmandu climate change refugees) and assess the impact of the provision of energy on people's lives against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and create impact through scalability of the energy solutions. Through the program we aim to build capacity with partner countries and organisations. To deliver this, the progress and outputs of the project will be disseminated through the UNESCO UNITWIN Network in Humanitarian Engineering (in which Coventry University is the global lead) as well as specially designed workshops to be held in Africa and Asia over the three year programme period. Ultimately, the project hopes to create a paradigm shift in the way refugees see themselves, instead of 'beneficiaries' dependent on handouts, they will be able to &amp;quot;HELP&amp;quot; themselves and become agents able to choose, produce, consume and take part in the running of their own communities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project sets out to increase the access of displaced people to affordable and sustainable energy by developing a
human and data-centred approach to knowledge about energy demands in contexts of displacement, by establishing new principles for the design and procurement of energy products and services, by implementing user-centred energy systems and processes, and by informing future energy policy and practice in the humanitarian sector. Success of the HELP project would enable the scaling and replication of modular energy systems with intelligent supply and demand management integrated with digital business processes to other refugee camps globally. Lessons from the project will inform the design of off-grid energy systems widely. Furthermore, it will cross-pollinate the PI and Co-Is research agenda and their other projects in this area. 

This project lays out a pathway to impact primarily through its collaboration with: 
- UN's global organisations (e.g. UK National Commission for UNESCO for the UNITWIN Network in Humanitarian Engineering - see letter of support), 
- existing third sector networks (e.g. Practical Action with their links to the Moving Energy Initiative), and 
- government (e.g. Scene Connect's advisory role with the Scottish government on the Local Energy Challenge Fund (LECF) for the development and impact of community renewables projects in Scotland). 

The project was developed in close consultation with Practical Action and Scene Connect and their involvement, from the outset, significantly enhances the capacity of this project to improve the provision of sustainable energy for refugees and those forcibly displaced by conflict, humanitarian emergency and environmental change in Rwanda and Nepal. Our empirical studies will draw upon the frameworks of engagement effectively provided by members of such organisations. Our dissemination strategy includes 

Society - The project lays out direct pathway to impact to society through a series of three 'Design for Displacement (D4D)' and twelve 'Energy for End-users (E4E)&amp;quot; workshops for industry, humanitarian actors and refugee stakeholders to be held in Oxford, Kigali, Kathmandu and in four refugee camps. The project provides access to a wide range of companies and humanitarian organisations creating an opportunity to widen our involvement and impact. In addition, the project will widen the knowledge base of researchers, students, renewable energy specialist, sensors experts, social scientist and digital business entrepreneurs. HELP can deliver direct benefits to refugee populations through the provision of clean energy by enhancing safety, security, health and livelihoods. Additional time for livelihood activities, particularly among women and girls would be created as refugees would reduce the amount of time needed to collect firewood. Cleaner more efficient methods of cooking could improve air pollution around the camps and impact on health and well being of refugees. Ultimately, the project hopes to create a paradigm shift in the way refugees see themselves, instead of 'beneficiaries' dependent on handouts, they will be able to &amp;quot;HELP&amp;quot; themselves and become agents able to choose, produce, consume and take part in the running of their own communities. 

Environment - This project will contribute to reducing charcoal and diesel usage (and the associated emission involved in the transportation of these fuels to remote refugee camps) through the provision of clean energy systems. Large emissions savings are possible through small changes and fundamental reform of the energy environment in camps.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>972701</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P029531/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE7CEC14-3FA2-49BC-89EE-062447C269C1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Efficiency</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
