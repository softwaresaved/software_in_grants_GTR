Yet, since the referendum on Scottish independence in September 2014, the pro-independence parties - the Scottish National Party and the Scottish Green Party - have experienced a huge surge in membership. The scale and pace of this is exceptional. Before the referendum, the Scottish National Party (SNP) reported a membership of approximately 26,000; now the party has over 100,000 members which, at close to 2.5% of the Scottish electorate, makes it the kind of mass party that the UK has not seen for decades. The Scottish Greens have experienced a similar dramatic increase in membership, with numbers rising from 1,500 before the September vote to more than 9,000 by March 2015. In a matter of a few short months, the SNP and Greens have become parties made up predominantly new recruits. And this at a time when, at home and abroad, political engagement through parties appeared to be in irreversible decline.

Our aim in this project is to examine the causes and consequences of this surge in party membership. We will explore how both the nature of the referendum campaign and its eventual outcome combined to generate such an unforeseen development. Our research questions derive mainly from academic theories of political participation and activism and will lead us to explore the political background, identities and motivations of the party members. Why did so many apparently turn from a grassroots and often unorthodox campaign to a more conventional form of participation? Are they reshaping the experience of party membership or is it reshaping them? And what impact has the sudden influx had on the parties themselves? Through a combination of mass surveys of party members and in-depth interviews with leading figures in the parties and campaign groups, we will address these and many other questions. Surveys of members of the SNP and Scottish Greens, timed to take place just over a year from the surge in membership, will allow us to explore members' involvement in and perceptions of the independence referendum, and to explore their experiences as party members, including the ways in which members participate, and how the experience of membership has confirmed or confounded expectations. Crucially, the study will involve comparison of the new recruits with established members, allowing us to determine whether the parties have attracted a new and different generation of political activists. Interviews with party and campaigning elites will focus on the consequences of these events for party organisations and on the relationship between the national movement for change - which is more like an informal social movement - and formal party membership. 

The Scottish Referendum and its aftermath have attracted widespread attention, within but also well beyond academia. We are keen to engage with as wide an audience as possible and to contribute to party and public debates on political participation and constitutional change. The parties themselves will be central to this research from the outset, via detailed consultation on the topics of the survey and then discussion and response to its findings. And the use of an online survey method will enable rapid preparation and communication of results. These will be made available to the parties, academic researchers, media observers and other interested parties via a series of briefing papers, discussion workshops, blog posts, and presentations at party meetings and academic conferences. The research team has an established record of publication with leading journals and university presses, and the climax of the project will be a co-authored book.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of our previous research on these two parties was considerable, shaping internal party strategy as well as being widely reported in the media. Our plans build on that track record of dissemination and on our excellent working relationships with key figures in four main clusters of audiences and beneficiaries:
1. The parties themselves
2. Policymakers/third sector organisations (notably bodies seeking to boost participation, such as the Electoral Commission in Scotland and the Democratic Society)
3. Campaigning organisations (notably movements within the referendum's Yes campaign, such as the National Collective and Women for Independence)
4. The mass media (notably at BBC Scotland, STV and a wide range of newspapers)

Our three key pathways to impact are:
-- co-producing the survey questionnaire with these impact partners
-- dissemination plans geared to their specific interests and requirements
-- using a diverse range of media to circulate our findings and insights to the widest possible audience

There are also three key stages in our impact plans:

1. Designing the surveys
The value of these surveys is much enhanced by cooperation with the parties themselves. One key means of fostering that collaboration is to give them - and our other impact partners - the opportunity to recommend themes and questions for the survey. As well as ongoing consultation via e-mail and Skype, we will host a questionnaire design workshop in Aberdeen in December 2015 for interested parties. Those attending will be invited to submit proposals that will feed in to the research team's questionnaire design discussions. We will also consult on question design with those who have surveyed the members of other political parties, both in Britain and in comparable international contexts, thus maximising the project's comparative potential. By the end of the design phase, then, we will have a range of people and organisations involved in the design of the survey and thus with a reinforced interest in our findings. 

2. Initial findings
The speed of collecting and processing internet survey data means that we will have initial findings - on matters such as the changing socio-demographic profile of these party memberships - available within a month or so of launching the survey. We plan on disseminating these findings through personal media contacts, press releases, posts on blogs and social media, and on the project website. Our releases, briefings and reports will be designed for a range of audiences, including policymakers, practitioners and party members, with research presented in a clear non-technical fashion. 

3. Further analysis
As the project progresses, we will produce more detailed analysis of our survey and interview data, resulting in scientific outputs but also non-technical documents for our partners outside academia. These will serve as the basis for a number of presentations and, in particular, two workshops - both free to attend and widely advertised to all relevant parties - intended for discussion of the broader implications of our findings. The first is a two-day academic conference, in Aberdeen in September 2016, with our own presentations supplemented by invited contributions from leading international researchers in this field. The second is a half-day open forum event in Edinburgh, October 2016, at which our key findings will be presented to a diverse audience of our impact partners, members of the parties and campaigning organisations, and interested members of the public. In addition to these events, we will present findings to both parties directly at their annual conferences and regional meetings. 

We will use a range of methods for monitoring the effectiveness of our impact strategy throughout the life of the project and for several years afterwards.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>190973</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project is on-going and key findings are not yet available. However, the project has successfully utilised a mixed method style of investigation. On-line surveys of SNP and Scottish Green members have been conducted, with a final stage of reminders due to take place shortly. In addition, an extensive programme of face-to-face interviews with party and movement elites and activists is in process. This mixed method approach is proving successful in our attempt to understand political mobilisation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A range of academic and non-academic audiences have a potential interest in our research. Key audiences and beneficiaries are:
? the political parties themselves - our findings will provide the parties with important information on the characteristics and attitudes of members, helping with membership development strategies.
? policymakers/third sector - various organisations and bodies seeking to boost participation, such as the Electoral Commission in Scotland and the Electoral Reform Society.
? campaigning organisations - part of the membership surge comes from movements within the referendum's Yes campaign, giving them considerable interest in our findings. 
? the mass media - a wide range of Scottish and UK media outlets have previously given airtime/column inches to our research and expressed interest in this project.
Many of these potential beneficiaries are being consulted throughout the project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>81C22E5C-7B26-44CB-BB4D-C4C6869732BB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N010590/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19539613-8143-4CD6-B1E5-0C7B93D08B7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural &amp; experimental eco</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9FC0ED75-DE3F-405C-942B-631C356746EB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
