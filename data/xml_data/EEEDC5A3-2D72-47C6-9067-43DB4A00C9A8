and Prevention through Engineering and Sciences</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M000109/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Faecal Incontinence (FI) is defined as the inability to fully control the passage of faeces through the anus. This may arise due to a weakened anal sphincter muscle (typically following child birth), problems with nerve supply (e.g. stroke, multiple sclerosis), or in association with other gastrointestinal conditions (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome). It is a common and distressing condition that causes shame, embarrassment, depression, social isolation, secrecy, poor self-esteem, and sexual avoidance. As a result, more than 54% of patients with FI have not discussed their symptoms with a physician , and only one-quarter of patients with FI are referred by their GP for specialist treatment . Its exact prevalence is difficult to determine but best estimates suggest that in the adult population it is around 10%, and that 0.5% - 1% below 65 years and 3% - 8% over 65 years experience regular faecal incontinence. Urinary Incontinence (UI) is defined as involuntary leakage of urine, UI presents a major burden on NHS resources. It is a common and distressing condition, which impacts of quality of life. The main forms of UI are stress incontinence (SUI), which is leakage with physical exertion, and urge incontinence (UUI), which is leakage with a strong desire to void. Mixed urinary incontinence is a combination of SUI and UUI. The prevalence of UI increases with age and is higher in institutionalised adults, who tend to be older and suffer associated co-morbidity. It is more often a problem for females, with prevalence rates of UI ranging from 4.5% to 53% in women, as compared to 1.5% and 24% in men. Although previously considered in isolation, it is increasingly recognised that many forms of FI and UI share a common underlying pathophysiology and frequently co-exist with pelvic organ prolapse

Incontinence places a massive burden on the NHS and impacts significantly on quality of life for thousands of patients in the UK. Whilst many areas of medical engineering share a growth in the engagement of engineers and scientists to push forward the exploitation of emerging technologies it is arguably the case that the nature of this disease prevents engineering and science research leaders seeing the potential for some rich research challenges. This proposed network will provide a step change in the increased engagement of leading UK technologists (from academia and industry) to provide a substantial impact to incontinence sufferers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact from the IMPRESS Network will be achieved primarily through establishment of better channels of communication between researchers in the engineering and physical sciences, persons affected by incontinence and their healthcare providers, and industry. In doing so, it will resolve the current impasse that stifles innovation and translation of new engineering technologies for the management, treatment and prevention of incontinence.

Knowledge: Technology &amp;amp; scientific advances - Research challenges identified by the Network will be disseminated via academic publications in open access journals, as well as the IMPRESS interactive website and webinars. The Incontinence Technology Advocates will disseminate the Network's outputs at scientific and clinical research meetings, especially those covering technology areas capable of addressing the clinical/engineering challenges identified by the Network. The Network will actively seek to disseminate its progress and findings to other users in the healthcare service via the activities of the three affiliated HTCs (Colorectal Therapies, Enteric, and D4D), via their websites and emailed newsletters. 
Society: The Patient Focus Groups to be engaged with during Stage III of the Network will provide direct discourse between the research community and persons in society affected by incontinence. The geographical spread of clinical and patient participants from across the UK will ensure the composition of the Network will be balanced to reflect the variety of affected persons from mixed ages, ethnic, and social groups. Patient feedback from the Focus Groups will be particularly important for gaining the views and opinions of persons affected by different aspects of incontinence.
Policy - The Network will address a significant unmet medical need and is aimed at providing an impetus to invest and create new disruptive engineering technologies for this rarely mentioned but highly prevalent conditioned. The Network will work with the International Longevity Centre-UK (ILC) and the All Party Parliamentary Group for Continence Care to disseminate, promote and implement its findings into future healthcare and social policies.

People: Skills-Through the planned 'learning and information exchange sessions', scientists will be educated by healthcare providers and patients about the causes and medical needs that currently exist for persons affected by incontinence. The 'Incontinence Technology Advocates' will serve as a conduit between clinicians/surgeons/patients and the wider scientific community, which will help with technology development, especially how patients' needs can be fed into the design and development stages of new technologies 

Economy: Wealth creation-Incontinence is a relatively unexploited clinical condition that offers significant opportunities for academic-industrial collaboration and subsequent value for commercial exploitation. 

Once a list of research challenges for the Network has been identified, industrial partners for each of these will be sought to facilitate future development. Identification of industry partners will be facilitated through liaison with the Knowledge Transfer Network, TSB Catapult Centres in High Value Manufacturing and Cell Therapy, and the Industrial Partnerships Group/Translational Research Office at UCL.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>130809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Healthcare Technology Co-operatives (HTCs)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with NIHR Colorectal Therapies Healthcare Technology Co-operative (HTC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>8A45426A-0CA2-4460-B5FF-0C375817463C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A consultation with a group of around 8 surgeons resulted in essential feedback, in April 2015.

We are now moving into the latter, having achieved our goals in the first phase; our key activities and their resultant output are described below (a full list is available on the IMPRESS website, www.impress-network.com):

*Knowledge Building
During its first year the IMPRESS network has instigated and maintained an ongoing series of activities to train its IMPRESS Incontinence Technology Advocates (TAs) (experts from the science and engineering community) in the clinical challenges faced in the area of incontinence:
? IMPRESS Knowledge Building Workshop: a 2 day event at St James's Hospital Leeds as an introduction to the current clinical treatments for incontinence, delivered by a team of 15 clinicians, 4 industry reps and 3 patients. Output: Trained and engaged 15 IMPRESS TAs to build the network
? IMPRESS Healthcare Professional Shadowing held between our TAs and 9 specialist healthcare professionals to identify differing conditions and the technological interventions currently used to address them. Output: 8 detailed case-studies made publically available through the IMPRESS website covering specialities including surgery, radiology, nursing and rehabilitation. Dr Culmer (PI) has been awarded funding from the ISSF Wellcome scheme to continue this work in more detail.
? IMPRESS Focus Workshop: held at UCL with clinicians, PPI reps, IMPRESS TAs and HTC links, brought together to review some of the emerging technologies in science and engineering and brainstorm how they could be applied to incontinence unmet needs. Output: The first round of IMPRESS Pilot Projects was opened for proposals (detailed below) and our network was expanded to 20 TAs.

*Network Building and Dissemination
We have actively worked to expand the IMPRESS network and disseminate using online media (via the IMPRESS website, Twitter account and LinkedIn Group) together with targeted activity through the TAs:
? Scientific Meetings: We have promoted IMPRESS at key scientific and healthcare events including; the influential 'Innovating for Incontinence' 2015 conference, ERIC/PROMOCON Symposium 2015, the EMBC Medical Engineering 2015 and OUTLOOK? 2014. Output: Significant interest generated has led to new collaborations with industry (Novuqare Ltd. Uroglide), invited talks (PROMOCON 2016, Incontinence: the Engineering Challenge X) and links to researchers and clinicians (i.e. Prof. Lovick, Prof. Dogramadzi) 
? Industry Engagement: Through our HTC network partners we have conducted specific meetings with key industry partners related to incontinence healthcare (American Medical Systems, Coloplast, Olympus Medical). Output: Expansion of industry involvement in the network, foundations for new collaborative projects (to target our 2nd round of pilot projects) and an industry-supported PhD project with University of Leeds and Olympus (starting Oct 2015).
? PPI involvement: We have engaged with patient groups through our HTC partners (and related events), at scientific meetings (see above) and in public forums (IMPRESS promotion at St James' Hospital, Leeds during World Continence Week 2015). We are running patient-specific IMPRESS events over the next 6 months, starting with the 'IMechE Incontinence' event (Nov 2015). Output: Our direct patient network has expanded, together with additional links to key patient-advocacy groups (i.e PROMOCON and ERIC) enabling us to engage more effectively with these end-users.
? Policy and Strategy: We have exploited our network contacts to engage with policy makers related to incontinence care and treatment. We have outlined IMPRESS to the UK All Party Parliamentary Group For Continence Care and are collaborating with the International Longevity Centre (a Think-Tank dedicated to addressing challenges of aging, including incontinence, to inform decision making in government). We collaborate closely with our HTC partners with their links to clinical and regulatory bodies. Output: We are scheduled to update the UK All Party Parliamentary Group For Continence Care and present our work at HTC events in 2015 and 2016. Dr Culmer has been sponsored as a member of ICI-RS and attended their Annual Meeting on Policy.
 
*Pilot Projects
Our IMPRESS Focus Workshop launched a competition to award pump-prime funding to five pilot projects which foster new collaboration and develop ideas for applying the latest technologies to create novel incontinence devices, products and treatments. This first-round of projects was clinically driven and features extensive collaboration between partner institutes, helping to broaden expertise within the network. 
? &amp;quot;Tactile Sensing Capsule for Assessment of Incontinence&amp;quot;, Prof S. Dogramadzi, Bristol Robotics Lab; this project will adapt robotic sensing technology to objectively assess pelvic floor dysfunction.
? &amp;quot;Smart-Plug: Diagnostic System&amp;quot;, Dr M. Oldfield, Mechatronics in Medicine Lab, Imperial College; this project will develop an active physical model of the anal sphincter system. This advanced simulation system will be used for device development (with Bristol) and clinical training.
? &amp;quot;Biotribology of Incontinence Management Products&amp;quot;, Dr M. Bryant, Engineering, Leeds; this will characterise the tribological properties of commercially available incontinence products to understand how they can be optimised through surface treatments
? &amp;quot;A fat chance of curing incontinence&amp;quot;, Dr R. Day, UCL; this will explore the efficacy of tissue engineering approaches to augment the pelvic floor and improve continence.
? &amp;quot;Pelvic nerve stimulation to control urinary continence&amp;quot;, Prof. T. Lovick, University of Bristol; evaluating a novel electrical stimulation technique of the pelvic nerve for urinary urge incontinence.

*Technology Transfer and Collaboration
We have actively engaged with our HTC partners throughout the IMPRESS project as our primary mechanism for technology transfer and clinical/industry collaboration. This has included maintaining an active presence at HTC events (i.e. the National HTC in Colorectal Therapies meeting 2014, 2015) together with regular interaction between the management committees. This has been a true collaboration benefiting all parties, for example IMPRESS identified links relevant to the HTCs (i.e. Queens University Belfast and the Uroglide project, now in discussions with D4D on future collaborations). Similarly we have received valuable input from the HTCs (i.e. PPI links to steer research at HTC meetings).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are regularly disseminating our findings from IMPRESS workshop events, research and network collaborations to inspire and inform future research in the area.

Our pilot funding scheme is linked to clinical and patient feedback and will lead to further funding applications to RCUK and other funding bodies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D462A4A7-D125-4900-A734-9360EFE15073</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.impress-network.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M000109/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
