In the 30 years since its introduction it has become a mainstay tool in cognitive neuroscience as well as a potential therapeutic tool to treat a variety of neurological conditions such as depression and to enhance recovery after stroke. However, it is still a relatively blunt tool. It activates a mixture of neurones in an excited area. Some of these are inhibitory, some excitatory; some are interneurons and some are projection neurones. Thus the effect we observe physiologically (on EEG or fMRI) and behaviourally (e.g. reaction times or response accuracy) represents a net effect of multiple interacting circuits. Variations in the proportions of neural types activated can vary between people and contribute to the large inter-individual differences that are common in TMS experiments. The aim of this project is to increase selectivity of TMS by employing an advanced TMS device to manipulate the shape and directionality of the stimulus waveform. We will use it to explore the role of selected populations of neurones in motor cortex during movement preparation and learning in a way that previously has not been possible. We will also show that the same principles may also apply to frontal areas of the cortex.
We have some pilot data which has identified important pulse parameters that we focus on in the present proposal. In the motor cortex we expect that with one set of parameters we will be able to target a population of inputs to motor cortex from premotor areas that are also modulated by information from cerebellum. These inputs will be most important in choosing the right action from a known set of alternative actions. They will also participate in tasks involving adaptation to new movement parameters, such as modulation of visual input gain. This data will be complemented by detailed neurophysiological investigations that will help us to understand the actions of targeted stimulation on identified neural circuits (GABAa-, GABAb- and cholinergic connections). We will in parallel collect data about the form of EEG evoked activity and the interaction of stimulus types with ongoing EEG rhythms. This will allow us to extend our work to other cortical areas and compare their effects with that on motor cortex. Finally we will examine effects of targeted stimulation on repetitive TMS protocols. These are often referred to as &amp;quot;plasticity&amp;quot; protocols since they are thought to change the excitability of synaptic connections in the stimulated area for an hour or so after rTMS. They are important because they are used in therapeutic setting, for example to treat depression or rehabilitation after stroke. By targeting specific populations of neurones we expect to change the effects of rTMS, making it potentially more reliable and better focussed to the disorders it may be used to treat.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We will use a controllable parameter TMS device to increase selectivity of cortical stimulation. Pilot data on motor cortex allows us to reduce the &amp;quot;parameter space&amp;quot; explored by focussing on the effects of an anterior-posterior induced current pulse of 30 microsec duration (AP30) and a posterior-anterior pulse of 120 microsec duration. We will show that these pulses interact differentially with selection of motor responses in the preparatory period of a reaction task as well as with different forms of motor learning (model-based and model-free). Parallel experiments will explore the effects of AP30 and PA120 on neurophysiological measures of GABA and cholinergic function (e.g. SICI, LICI, SAI). We will then examine the effects of the pulses on EEG activity, studying the average evoked response (where GABAa and GABAb components can be identified), spread to other cortical areas and effects on ongoing brain rhythms. These data from motor cortex will then be compared with data from stimulation of frontal cortex to test whether similar selectivity can be produced there. We expect this to be the case, with the one exception that the directions of stimulation will be related to the orientation of underlying sulci as predicted from existing models of induced current flow. The EEG experiments will be complemented by &amp;quot;twin coil&amp;quot; experiments in which a conditioning stimulus over frontal cortex will be used to modulate the excitability of motor cortex. The hypothesis is that the direction and pulse duration of the conditioning stimulus will influence its effect on motor cortex. Finally we will test implications for repetitive TMS methods. These are conventionally used to produce &amp;quot;plastic&amp;quot; changes in the excitability of cortical synaptic connections which lead to after-effects on excitability that outlast the period of stimulation. We hypothesise that if we can target selective sets of neurones that these protocols will have different effects than seen with conventional TMS.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Public beneficiaries: Enhancing the targeting ability of TMS will have key benefits in the health sector. Repetitive TMS is currently undergoing clinical trials in the UK and other countries as a potential treatment for depression and as an adjunct to rehabilitation afters stroke. Indeed, in the USA it is licensed by the FDA for the treatment of medically refractory depression. However, in most conditions the response rate is low (~38%), and this has prevented widespread adoption. The methodologies developed in the proposed research could translate to improved rTMS protocols that target more effective neural populations in each condition. It will increase efficacy and enhance response and remission rates leading to improved quality of life for patients and carers. If response size and reproducibility can be enhanced rTMS has the potential to become a treatment of choice, particularly for depression and in stroke recovery.
The data will also provide novel insights into the control systems involved in movement, i.e. the connectivity and oscillatory activity of circuits involved in movement. By helping to decompose this neural activity, the data set could impact brain-computer interfaces where EEG recordings are used to control electronic devices, and which have a range of applications including control of prosthetic limbs in spinal cord injured individuals.

Private Sector beneficiaries: This project will lead to several major methodological developments which can be exploited across a range of research and clinical settings to study and interact with human brain function and behaviour. Manufacturers of devices for non-invasive brain stimulation, both nationally and internationally, will benefit from the methodological developments and from the increased economic value associated with improved brain stimulation methods. In particular we know from informal discussion that the UK companies Rogue Resolutions and Magstim are both awaiting the outcome of our studies before investing in further development of commercial TMS devices. 

Staff beneficiaries: The research staff member appointed in this work will develop skills in programming and testing a novel and unique device. S/he will learn how to disseminate this information to colleagues and inform them of new concepts involved in targeted TMS. Importantly s/he will be deeply involved in development of the device and crucial for advising on the most appropriate ways to modify software and hardware. Such skills will readily translate into all research and development sectors.
The technical staff involved in the project will also obtain experience in development of a new device that has high potential for being taken up in the commercial sector. Such experience will prove easily transferrable to cutting edge technologies in any field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>429246</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N016793/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EFFEC6B1-6BC8-4C9D-9D77-02CEF5E4E301</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomedical neuroscience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80A9D6C5-792D-4DD9-9138-BEC1BB556AA9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technology and method dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
