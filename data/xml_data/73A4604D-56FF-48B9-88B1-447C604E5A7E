Because they are found in such small quantities in fruits and other crops the material isolated from nature are very expensive. However, the demand in the flavour, food and cosmetics industry runs into tens of thousands of tonnes per annum. Almost all materials in current use are chemically synthesised from fossil fuel sources using polluting technology. Some feedstocks are harvested from the bark of trees which are killed in the process. As demand for these products increase there is a clear need for synthesis processes that are environmentally friendly and use sustainable feedstocks. The aim of this Follow-on-Fund project is to provide a one-pot process using enzyme catalysis by well-established fermentation technology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102772</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oxford Biotrans Ltd.</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Industry partner</gtr:description><gtr:id>F4D8924B-5DB5-4FDA-B5D2-5065756C05C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Early stage programme, none directly from this research project but the company is commercialising a flavouring product from the PI's earlier work, with product launch planned for Q1/Q2, 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The company has provided vital links to commercial distributors and end-users for information on market size and likely future demand of the lactone target product of this research project.

Since 2014 I deliver a lecture on biological synthesis pathways to flavour and fragrances and biologically active compounds from plants and microorganisms and, most importantly, use these to illustrate fundamental concepts in chemistry, biochemistry, biology and engineering. The aim is to broaden the horizons of the students and to inspire them to view a degree in STEM subjects as the providing the basic skills and training for a wide range of careers in science, R&amp;amp;D, engineering and teaching. After the lectures the students are given an afternoon session in the practical laboratories to see how state-of-the-art instrumentation and techniques are applied to solve problems. Feedback has been universally positive, highlighting the diverse audience participation, the informative nature of the lectures and especially the broad view of science and technology that students had rarely been exposed to before. The application rate to STEM subjects in 100%, and up to 20% per year have been accepted to the Oxford Chemistry degree course.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://outreach.chem.ox.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research project made sufficient progress on enzyme engineering to convert an economical feedstock from sustainable natural sources to a high value flavour compound. The reaction system is attractive because the product will be classified as natural grade and the enantioselectivity closely matches the premium grade natural product on the market. Initial scale up trials were carried out during the project. The results are sufficiently promising for an SME to start pre-pilot scale process development towards commercial production, while a potential distributor has confirmed the current market size and the likely growth in future years.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8D287CDF-C308-4301-983E-2CC42CB94B40</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The initial discovery phase progressed as planned, with preliminary results providing indicators for approaches to the target product and process for its synthesis.

As the enzyme evolution work progressed it became clear that both the mutations in the scientific literature and our starting mutations did not give sufficient substrate conversion to product or optical isomer purity for a viable process. However, further detailed investigations involving studies on over 100 enzyme variants enabled us to identify the mutations with detrimental effects. By the end of the project a new enzyme variant with sufficiently high activity and optical isomer ratio close to the highest grade product on the market was discovered. The high added value of this product grade has led to pre-pilot scale process development at a commercial flavours and fragrances company.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The enzyme material and biocatalytic process to be developed can be scaled up to pilot scale and eventual commercial manufacturing while the academic community will gain further insight into the engineering of enzymes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>344032B4-86CF-4391-920B-732867ABF818</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>Oxford Biotrans Ltd.</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>The company has licensed two patents from the portfolio of the PI and is engaged in commercial scale-up of a biocatalytic process to produce the grapefruit flavour compound nootkatone via oxidation of valencene.

Initial samples were presented by De Monchy Aromatics, the marketing partner, at industry shows in 2015 and 2016. The Company established its R&amp;amp;D facilities at Milton Park, Didcot, Oxfordshire, employing 15 scientists in process and new product development. The premises was officially opened by Nicola Blackwood, MP, in March 2016. Oxford Biotrans has since developed the process further, achieving commercial scale (cubic metres) reactions in Q4 2016. Full production and commercial launch is planned in Q3 2017, at which point the profits from sales will enable the company to be self-financing. Further VC funding is being considered for expansion of the product portfolio into other sectors. The Company has been featured in, e.g. the Daily Telegraph and the RSC publication Chemistry World.</gtr:impact><gtr:url>http://www.oxfordbiotrans.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2013</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2E19D5E4-EC98-4DCF-A9A6-CFDA22043FCC"><gtr:id>2E19D5E4-EC98-4DCF-A9A6-CFDA22043FCC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Drug Oxidation by Cytochrome P450BM3 : Metabolite Synthesis and Discovering New P450 Reaction Types.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6297e30d8b716ffb224209fa405d7e9f"><gtr:id>6297e30d8b716ffb224209fa405d7e9f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ren X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0947-6539</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/01DA4E02-8C66-4328-8583-BAC780713C47"><gtr:id>01DA4E02-8C66-4328-8583-BAC780713C47</gtr:id><gtr:title>Synthesis of Imidazolidin-4-ones via a Cytochrome P450-Catalyzed Intramolecular C-H Amination</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS Catalysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6297e30d8b716ffb224209fa405d7e9f"><gtr:id>6297e30d8b716ffb224209fa405d7e9f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ren X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L024381/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
