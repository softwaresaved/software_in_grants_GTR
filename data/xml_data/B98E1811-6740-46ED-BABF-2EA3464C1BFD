To date, little empirical research has been conducted on intra-European queer migration, despite very uneven levels of recognition of LGB (lesbian, gay, bisexual) rights across Europe. This raises questions as to whether transnational migration can be a strategy for enabling non-heteronormative practices and identities, and for accessing sexual citizenship rights.

The proposed project will explore how sexuality may shape intra-European migration through a focus on the lived experiences of LGB migrants who have moved to Scotland from the postsocialist region [Eastern Europe (EE) and the Former Soviet Union (FSU)]. The project's geographical scope is timely, as comparative surveys point to an East/West divide within Europe in terms of policy, legislation and attitudes towards LGB citizens, with the UK ranked among the most progressive European countries and most countries from the post-socialist region lagging behind (FRA 2013). Moreover, since the mid-2000s the UK has experienced high rates of immigration from the region, with an estimated 653,000 Eastern Europeans settling in the UK in the period 2004-2011 (Vargas-Silva 2013:4). 

A focus on Scotland as a migration destination can illuminate broader issues related to UK and intra-European queer migration, whilst also presenting a distinctive and interesting case, owing to: i) the significant recent influx of migrants from the post-socialist region to Scotland ii) the higher proportion of European to non-European migrants in Scotland compared to most other UK regions; iii) Scotland's recent shift from a country of emigration to a country with a positive migration balance; iv) Scotland's devolved government and specific demographic and socio-legal context within the UK, despite migration remaining a 'reserved' Westminster matter.

This project will provide an in-depth and nuanced exploration of the lived experiences of LGB migrants, generating significant original data and fresh insights into the role of sexuality in the migration process. The project is interdisciplinary in nature, and draws on empirical, theoretical and methodological insights from sociology, area studies, human geography and anthropology. The research innovatively brings together theoretical frameworks previously used in isolation (intersectionality, transnationalism and personal communities). It combines biographical interviews (phase 1) with visual methods (photo diaries, sociograms) and follow-up interviews (phase 2), in order to capture the complexity of migrants' experiences, multiple belongings and emotional attachments. The research will explore how sexuality affects reasons for migrating, experiences of migration and plans for long-term settlement. It will also contextualise migrants' sense of (dis)comfort, (in)security and belonging within the social networks they cultivate across home and host societies, and consider the role played by sexuality and ethnicity in shaping migrants' 'personal communities' (Pahl and Spencer 2004) and their engagements with them. While foregrounding sexuality and ethnicity, the research will also consider how other factors (such as socio-economic background, gender, nationality, migration status etc) may affect experiences of migration and resettlement. 

The research will contribute fresh empirical and conceptual insights to topical debates in sexuality and migration studies on the role played by intimacy, emotions and personal communities in shaping migration and resettlement. The research will also generate findings and outputs of interest to end users from the public and voluntary sector. This will be achieved through a sustained engagement with a range of stakeholders working with LGBT, migrant and minority ethnic communities, or promoting intersectional approaches to equality and diversity agendas.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will be of interest and directly benefit a range of stakeholders and research users, primarily from the voluntary and public sector. The project builds on the support of the Glasgow Refugee Asylum and Migration Network (GRAMNet), a research and knowledge exchange network within which the PI and co-I have developed existing collaborations with some of the project's partner organisations (see Pathways to Impact, CVs). The project's impact strategy draws on the collaborative partnership with the LGBT organisation LGBT Youth Scotland, the Minority Ethnic umbrella organisation Black and Ethnic Minority Infrastructure Scotland (BEMIS) and one of Scotland's four Regional Equality Councils, West of Scotland Regional Equality Council (WSREC). The project is also endorsed by the LGBT organisation Equality Network, a policy-oriented organisations with links to the Scottish government (see letters of support).
During the development of the proposal, consultation with the abovementioned organisations has highlighted a gap in understandings of the experiences and needs of non-heterosexual individuals from migrant and Minority Ethnic (ME) communities, and highlighted the need to develop collaboration and dialogue among stakeholders. Stakeholders' feedback has shaped the project's impact strategy, and collaborative engagement with them will continue through their involvement in the Project Advisory Group (PAG). The involvement of additional stakeholders, both in the PAG and in project-related consultation and public events, will be facilitated by BEMIS and GRAMNet. 

Stakeholders will benefit directly from the empirical insights generated by the project; collaborative engagement will be sustained throughout the project through i) the Project Advisory Group, ii) two consultation events; iii) dissemination of key findings through a research report; iv) 'on demand' project briefing sessions tailored to the needs of specific stakeholders; v) a public engagement event open to the general public; vi) the use of the project's website to share outputs and advertise project-related events. Support and expert advice from BEMIS, GRAMNet and Policy Scotland, a Glasgow University-based policy and knowledge exchange hub bringing together academics, practitioners and policy makers, will ensure the impact and uptake of research findings in Scotland and beyond, and provide stakeholders with access to structures influencing policy making. Collaborative work with PAG members will also create opportunities for the research team and voluntary sector staff to develop important transferrable skills in team work, problem solving, and effective integration of research and its practical applications. Cooperation will provide opportunities for personal and professional development for both research (knowledge exchange) and partner organisation staff (research-relevant skills) (see pathways to impact).

While the research is specifically focussed on LGB migrants from the post-socialist region, the project's impact-strategy aims to improve understandings of issues related to migration, sexuality and intersectional equality more generally. Thus, consultation and public engagement events intend to involve, and to facilitate dialogue across, a diverse range of migrant, minority ethnic, faith and LGBT communities. Intersectional discrimination is now recognised in both UK and EU law (Schiek and Lawson 2011); there are, however, growing concerns about the ability of multicultural policies to deal with conflicting equality agendas, and some of these emerging conflicts have been around LGBT and Minority Ethnic/religious rights agendas (Fassin 2010). The immediate benefits of the project will be most clearly felt in the Scotland and the UK, however the project will generate insights in advancing inclusive, intersectional approaches to issues of equality and diversity applicable in other parts of Europe and beyond.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252037</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>PHOTO EXHIBITION Home is where the heart is: LGBT migrants in Scotland Hillhead Library, Glasgow, 14-27 February 2017

The event is hosted jointly by the SNP Westminster Justice and Home Affairs Group and GRAMNet and will involve the launch of new research on this matter: &amp;quot;Family Migration, A Scottish Perspective&amp;quot; by Helen Baillot, an independent researcher in gender, family, migration and integration.
The Panel will consist of:
? Anne McLaughlin MP, SNP Spokesperson, Civil Liberties (Chair)
? Stuart McDonald MP, SNP Spokesperson, Immigration, Asylum &amp;amp; Border Control
? Helen Baillot, Practitioner &amp;amp; Researcher, &amp;quot;Family Migration, A Scottish Perspective&amp;quot;
? Prof. Rebecca Kay, Russian Gender Studies, University of Glasgow, GRAMNet
? Dr. Francesca Stella, Lecturer in Sociology, GRAMNet

This will also offer a timely opportunity to discuss the outcome of the recent &amp;quot;MM&amp;quot; Supreme Court case on the Immigration Rules of a Minimum Income requirement for a UK citizen to bring a non EU spouse into the UK.
Purpose of Event: The MPs and GRAMNet to: 
o Highlight the negative impact and spread of the UK Family Migration policy and other migration issues
o Inform the position of the Scottish government and of future policy within Scotland
o Share learning with key stakeholders (academic, legal, 3rd Sector etc)
o Encourage more research in this area
o inform public discourse and opinion

This event offered a timely opportunity to discuss the outcome of the recent &amp;quot;MM&amp;quot; Supreme Court case on the Immigration Rules of a Minimum Income requirement for a UK citizen to bring a non EU spouse into the UK, and the possible consequences of Brexit for EU family migration. The event sparked lively discussion and will inform the position of the Scottish government on migration, and future policy negotiations around devolving some aspects of migration policy to Scotland.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/family-migration-a-scottish-perspective-tickets-32320473406#</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interim consultation event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC39F113-626A-4CD9-989C-16E29CB818AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organisation of interim consultation event (26 April 2016) in order to share research findings and practitioners' knowledge, build sustainable and effective KE networks, and explore avenues for further collaborative work based on insights generated through KE activities.

The event will involve a presentation of key findings, combined with opportunities for networking, small group discussion and feedback from participants. Discussion with input from participants focussed around questions including:

 How can we translate insights from the project into recommendations and strategies for more inclusive practice?
 What areas would benefit from further, focussed research and/or the development of practice/policy related initiatives?
 What impact may Brexit have on the lives of LGBT migrants in Scotland (and more broadly on migrant, BME and LGBT communities)?

Participants in the final workshop included (among others) representatives of Scottish Government (Equality Unit), Police Scotland, sexual health organisations (Terrence Higgins Trust Scotland, Waverley Care, S-X), Stirling and Glasgow City Councils, LGBT organisations (LGBT YOuth Scotland, LGBT Health and Wellbeing, Stonewall), Equality organisations (West of Scotland Regional Equality Council, Fife Centre for Equalities).

1. Government and policy-makers:
The project was referenced in the 2015 online Migration Policy Toolkit by COSLA Strategic Migration Partnership. COSLA is a consortium of Scottish local authorities, and the national voice for local government in Scotland, representing local authorities before e.g. the Scottish Government). The Policy Toolkit is intended to be used by Scottish local authorities to help them address the needs of migrants.
Key findings were also shared with MPs from the SNP Westminster Parliamentary Group seeking input on the effects that family migraiton policies set by the Home Office are having in Scotland and in the UK as a whole (March 2017).

2. Communities and social services: contribution to ongoing colaborative work to advance intersectional approaches to equality and diversity
- meeting with Glasgow City Council's Principal Officer for Equalities (summer 2016) about potential collaboration to involve LGBT migrants in Hate Awareness Week (Oct 2016). Did not happen owing to time constraints but may revisit in 2017.
- invitation to deliver tailored briefing sessions on the project's findings to Glasgow Women's Library (March 2017) and LGBT STUC annual conference (May 2017). Both organisations currently have specific projects on challenging prejudice and intersectional inclusion.
- current bid (ESRC Impact Acceleration Account) to produce an educational resource on sexuality and migration, in collaboration with and equality organisation WSREC, and additionally supported by Education Scotland (agency of Scottish Government) and LGBT YOuth Scotland.

3. Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections
- Photo exhibition (Feb 2017) organised in collaboration with LGBT HIstory Month Scotland and LGBT Organisation OurStory Scotland, with the support of Glasgow Life (Glasgow City Council).

The project explores the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender migrants who have moved to Scotland from Central Eastern Europe (CEE) and the Former Soviet Union (FSU). Fieldwork was carried out in various locations across Scotland in two stages (April 2015 - June 2016). Stage 1 involved interviews with LGBT migrants about their experiences of migration and resettlement, and also relational mapping (sociograms) to chart their social networks. Stage 2 involved photo diaries and follow-up interviews to explore participants' sense of belonging and identity. Please see below a summary of key findings, taken from the final project report published in Dec 2016 (available at: https://intimatemigrationsdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/intimate-migrations-final-report-2016.pdf )

1. Migration to Scotland 

? Most of our participants were from EU countries, and their migration to Scotland was facilitated by free movement of labour within the EU. The majority of our participants had moved directly to Scotland from their country of origin. 
? Participants often spoke of several concurrent motivations to migrate. For the majority of our participants, employment opportunities and related prospects of greater material security were key reasons for migrating to Scotland, reflecting wider migration trends from CEE and FSU to the UK/Scotland. Many participants had moved with a partner or other family members (including e.g. children, parents, siblings). Some of our younger participants had moved to Scotland to pursue higher or further education.
? Sexual orientation and gender identity featured to varying degrees in participants' accounts of their reasons to migrate. None of our participants had left their country of origin because of persecution on grounds of their orientation or gender identity. However, a minority had experienced discrimination or violence, and many more had experienced more subtle forms of marginalisation (e.g. negative attitudes among family members, in education and employment; negative media/political discourse on LGBT people; lack of legal protection for same-sex couples and their families; cultural expectations that LGBT persons should be discreet). These experiences, combined with the expectation of more positive attitudes and greater legal recognition in the UK/Scotland, featured in many interviews. A relatively small number of participants, however, saw sexual orientation or gender identity as their sole or main reasons to migrate.

2. Migrant experiences in Scotland

Employment and material security
? The majority of our participants were in paid employment, and saw working in Scotland as a means to achieve greater material security than in their country of origin, where many had experienced economic hardship. 
? Finding a job in Scotland was relatively easy. Whilst several migrants found similar or better jobs compared to the ones they had in their country of origin, a high proportion of our participants worked in low-skilled, low-paid jobs, particularly in hospitality and in the service sector, often below their educational qualifications. For some participants entry level or low-skilled jobs were stepping stones towards better jobs; however, for some these jobs were a long-term prospect or final destination. As a result, they often experiencing deskilling and felt a loss of social status.
? Participants were generally happy with the living standards afforded by their jobs in Scotland. Even when working in relatively low-paid jobs, they earned more and enjoyed a higher standard of living than in their countries of origin. For many, economic security contributed to a sense of 'feeling secure' in Scotland, and was seen as an acceptable trade-off for other challenges and insecurities arising from migration (e.g. deskilling, being away from family, language and cultural barriers). 

Education
? Almost a third of our participants had experiences of studying in Scotland, most of them at Scottish universities or colleges. 
? For university students, the no tuition fee policy for EU nationals and the quality of courses were important considerations in choosing to study in Scotland.
? For many participants, gaining skills and qualifications in Scotland (including vocational and ESOL qualifications, as well as higher/further education) was seen as a way to secure better job prospects. 
Wellbeing and LGBT equality
? Participants' experiences as LGBT persons in Scotland generally compared favourably to what they had experienced in their country of origin. Most perceived attitudes towards LGBT persons in Scotland as more open and positive, and spoke about positive experiences at work, in educational institutions and in public services, as well as in everyday social interactions. 
? Many participants spoke about the importance of having a legal and policy framework that recognises LGBT rights and equality in Scotland, and about the sense that this was upheld.
? Many participants felt that they could be more open about their sexual orientation or gender identity in Scotland compared to their country of origin. Many felt they could be out as LGBT persons, and that disclosure of their sexual orientation or gender identity was considered ordinary and unremarkable in Scotland.
? LGBT affirmative legislation and more positive attitudes towards LGBT persons contributed greatly to participants' sense of wellbeing and security in Scotland, and was often a key factor in their decision to remain in Scotland, and not to return to their country of origin.
Prejudice and discrimination 
? Despite overall positive experiences in Scotland, several participants experienced prejudice or discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity; these were perpetuated both by local people and by other migrants.
? Despite overall positive and respectful interactions with local people, some participants had experienced xenophobic prejudice or discrimination in Scotland.
? A minority had experienced intersectional discrimination, where they were singled out both because of their sexual orientation/gender identity and because of their ethnicity.
? Some participants had challenged abuse and discrimination by reporting incidents to the police or other authorities (e.g. work managers), particularly in relation to sexual orientation.
Plans for the future
? A majority of participants expressed a desire to remain in Scotland long-term, or planned to settle permanently. Most participants did not consider returning to their country of origin. 
? For many, migration and resettlement were an ongoing process, as initial reasons for migrating were sometimes different from reasons for staying. Material security provided by working in Scotland, as well as having a partner, other family members and friends in Scotland, featured prominently in reasons for staying. Sexual orientation and gender identity often emerged as key reasons for staying, although they were less prominent in participants' accounts of immediate reasons to migrate.

3. Social networks, belonging and integration

? Participants' social networks included friends and family based in Scotland as well as in their country of origin; many also included people based in other parts of the UK, or in third countries.
? Creating new social networks in Scotland was a common challenge for participants, who often felt socially isolated when they first arrived in Scotland. Social networks were an important source of practical and emotional support, as well as providing participants with a sense of belonging, identity and wellbeing.
? A shared national or linguistic background emerged as a significant factor in shaping participants' social networks in Scotland. Often they included a large number of co-nationals as partners, close friends or acquaintances. This was especially the case with Polish participants, because of a presence of a sizable Polish community in Scotland. Participants' social networks also included local people, although they featured less prominently, as well as migrants from other countries. 
? Shared language and culture were important aspects of relations with co-nationals (many of which had started in their country of origin, prior to migration). Practical and emotional support from co-nationals was often important in mitigating risk upon moving to Scotland. Several participants were also involved in community initiatives (recreational or offering support) involving co-nationals. Some participants spoke about being better able to express emotions in their language, and about language and culture as intimately linked to their identity.
? Some participants found socialising primarily with co-nationals restrictive, and actively branched out to meet local people. Some of participants had experienced homophobia (or bi-/transphobia) at the hands of co-nationals, or perceived attitudes among co-nationals in Scotland as less tolerant; a minority of participants felt uncomfortable socialising with co-nationals for this reason. Other participants, however, had positive experiences coming out to co-nationals, and the vast majority included co-nationals in their social networks.
? Most participants had overall positive and friendly relations with local people: many participants had significant ties with local people (as friends, partner, acquaintances) and had received support from them. Language and cultural barriers, however, were often experienced as an obstacle in socialising and getting to know local people, although many participants had built meaningful relationships over time.
? The vast majority of our participants were fluent in English, although a minority had little or no English upon arrival. Overcoming language and cultural barriers was often a challenge, particularly in the initial stages of settlement, and affected migrants' ability to communicate, their confidence and patterns of socialising.
? Sexual orientation and gender identity shaped participants' social networks: for most, acceptance and being able to be themselves were important factors in developing close relationships. For some participants, having LGBT friends or socialising in LGBT spaces was important, or had been important at some stage in their lives. Some had participated in, or volunteered for LGBT initiatives in Scotland.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic routes:

The grant is still active and we are in the process of writing up academic papers. It is too early at this stage to see clearly how the project can be taken forward or provide new conceptual insights that may be used by other academics. Some emerging ideas of how the findings could be taken forward or used:

1. revisiting and rethining concept of 'queer migration' drawing on empirical insights from the project, and combining insights from both sexuality/queer and migration studies (see conf paper Stella, F., Flynn, M. and Gawlewicz, A. 'Intimate Migrations: Exploring intra-European queer migrations through an intersectional lens') 

2. exploration of notions of 'normality' and a 'normal life', in paper Stella, Flynn and Gawlewicz Unpacking the meaning of a 'normal' life among LGBT Eastern European migrants in Scotland (submitted March 2017) . This paper has produced insights of relevance to both migration studies and sexuality studies literature, in relation to migrants' puruit of a better/normal life (in terms of material security) and also to the role of law and policy in 'normalising' LGBT lives (Richardson 2004) in contexts like Scotland/the UK, where LGBT affirmative legislation and policy is in place.

3. Exploration of how both ethno-linguistic background and sexuality/gender identity affect LGBT migrants' social networks in host society. See paper Gawlewicz, A., Stella, F. and Flynn, M. 'Negotiating sexuality through migration: Polish LGB and heterosexual migrants encountering each other in the UK context'

4. Insights into the role languages play in negotiating sexuality/gender identity and belonging in the context of transnational migration: see WiP paper Stella, F. and Gawlewicz, A. The language of the heart? East European LGBT migrants talking about sexuality

2. Non-academic routes: Educational resource

Dr Stella is currently applying for an ESRC IAA grant to take this work forward; the aim of the KE project is the co-production of an educational resource, to be used by staff from voluntary, educational and public sector organisations. Over the duration of the IM project engagement with stakeholders has highlighted:
? Reluctance to engage explicitly with LGBT issues in organisations working with ME and migrant populations, including ESOL contexts. Lack of training and resources was identified as a key barrier.
? The need to explain to service users with limited English widely used diversity monitoring forms. Questions about sexual orientation and gender identity are often puzzling through language and cultural barriers.
? The need to equip migrants coming from cultures where non-heterosexual and transgender practices are hidden and stigmatised with an understanding of the UK context, where LGBT people are very visible and LGBT equality is protected through policy and legislation.
? The need to make services more inclusive of both LGBT and migrant/ME populations (e.g. limited engagement of migrant and ME individuals with LGBT organisations; the need to create educational spaces inclusive of LGBT learners).
The idea of an educational resource emerged organically from consultation events, and was identified as a useful tool to make service provision more inclusive by a range of stakeholders. The resource will include material that can be used in staff training, as well as material that can be adapted for engagement with service users (e.g. explaining equality monitoring forms; challenging prejudices about LGBT or migrants expressed by service users.)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>35A7E64D-730B-4E5C-A14E-0AAF2AA47F9A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://intimatemigrationsdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/intimate-migrations-final-report-2016.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>COSLA Migration Policy Toolkit</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C7425FC-98E6-4558-8BD6-7C7DC7BCC9C4</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.migrationscotland.org.uk/migration-matters-scotland/policy-toolkit</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DEE27A37-E800-4FD6-8E31-630A090CAD66"><gtr:id>DEE27A37-E800-4FD6-8E31-630A090CAD66</gtr:id><gtr:title>Preliminary Findings Report: Lesbian, bisexual and gay migration from Eastern Europe to Scotland</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/dceeaa19c01cdfdc0992b043618d19bd"><gtr:id>dceeaa19c01cdfdc0992b043618d19bd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stella, F.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L009307/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3EA5AAEC-135B-436C-8F77-F32CCCA7FF8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
