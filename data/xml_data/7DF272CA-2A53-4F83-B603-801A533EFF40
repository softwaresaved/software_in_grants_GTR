Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K000683/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Human rights trials, truth commissions, memorialisation projects and restorative justice processes are implemented with increasing frequency across the globe. However, as different approaches to transitional justice have been advocated and implemented, there have been clashes over the means through which lawyers, civil society actors, scholars and local populations know atrocity and respond to it. In practice, the divergent methods used to examine serious human rights violations have challenged the evidentiary bases of criminal convictions and truth commission reports. Within the scholarship, cross-national studies have now identified general trends, yet these may not necessarily produce the kind of knowledge useful for specific country contexts. At the same time detailed case studies, in carefully emphasising the particularities of a transition, may constrain the learning and adaptation of knowledge across countries.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This ESRC Knowledge Exchange aims to bridge the methodological divides within the practice and research of transitional justice, making scholarly research more accessible to actors implementing responses to atrocity. The project pursues this aim through an online forum, a seminar series, a set of practice-oriented workshops and a final evaluation and implementation meeting.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficary: swisspeace
The knowledge exchange will lead to the development of the transitional justice training manual that will improve the capacity-building initiatives undertaken by swisspeace and will strengthen its strategic partnership with OTJR. The potential impact will be an integrated practice and research oriented approach to transitional justice.

Beneficiary: International Criminal Lawyers
The legal practitioners from the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the ad hoc Tribunals who are involved in the online forum, seminar series and methods workshops will strengthen their strategic partnerships with civil society groups and scholars. Human rights reports have formed the basis for much of the initial investigations underpinning international criminal trials and scholars have played a central role as expert witnesses in these cases. A clearer understanding of the methods used by these diverse groups will benefit the international criminal lawyers as users of this research.

Beneficiary: Human Rights Civil Society Groups
Civil society groups that monitor the occurrence of serious human rights violations and assist in implementing responses to these violations, will have cutting edge research on current methods used to formulate, implement and research transitional justice. The potential impact will be the strengthening of the empirical evidence underpinning human rights reports. The practice-oriented workshops in Rwanda and Kosovo will enhance the research capacity of NGO's, researchers and human rights lawyers in these transitional countries and provide a model for future methodology training workshops.

Beneficiary: Policy-makers and the international development community which implement policies in countries emerging from conflict and/or repressive rule
The policy-makers will gain exposure to evidence-based knowledge, using diverse methods, on the impact of transitional justice interventions in post-conflict contexts, potentially impacting their approach to formulating and implementing transitional justice processes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95169</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>To start the final evaluation and implementation meeting, our civil society partners, swisspeace launched the 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual', at a well attended panel discussion in Bern Switzerland.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD82D6F5-E693-4BF9-B265-E8F0650184F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The youtube movie has been viewed online and offers an introduction to the 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual'.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Final Evaluation and Implementation Meeting: Exploring the Nexus between Academic and Advocacy Research</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGD1wM9-88I</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Swiss Peace Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:description>swisspeace collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7941226-2551-4397-AC6B-23415EA0BA57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1) From January 2013 to January 2014, OTJR and its civil society partner swisspeace, in collaboration with the Dickson Poon School of Law, King's College, London and the Leuven Institute of Criminology, Faculty of Law, KU Leuven, hosted 12 public seminars and 8 roundtable discussions.

This web-based platform will provide multimedia, multi-lingual real time coverage of transitional justice news, uncovering the facts, delving into background, and providing context, analysis and different perspectives and points of view. The platform will be a resource for journalists and a teaching tool as well as a news site, including interactive timelines, a transitional justice lexicon, biographies, and background information. OTJR's role will be to provide academic research contributions to the online platform. To bridge the methodological divides between journalism and academia, OTJR will facilitate the provision of 3-4 articles per month for JI publication. These articles will include background information on conflicts, political parties, and transitional justice mechanisms, biographies of individuals, and analyses of central issues and themes in transitional justice. They will be published on the JI web-based platform.

Abstract

As representation of past atrocities memorials and memorial museums connect past, present and future in non-linear ways. Located in the here and now, they suggest and encourage particular interpretations of the past with view to an anticipation of a specific future.

Based on the notions of heterotopia as introduced by Michel Foucault the paper analyses the role and function of memorials in transitional justice processes. Heterotopia refers to 'other spaces' or spaces of otherness, i.e. spaces that exist parallel to reality and that, at the same time, question and challenge this reality. In this sense, museums or memorials to commemorate atrocities constitute spaces where objects from other spaces (and times) - in our cases related to the experience of massive human rights abuses - are displayed so that they continue to exist in time, yet also outside of time. They seek to preserve objects from another time for today as well as for the future. In the context of transitional justice processes the portrayed past might run counter to hegemonic discourses about how the past should be remembered officially and thus constitute a room for dissent and discord.

Abstract: The discourse of transitional justice has emerged as a response to the needs of societies emerging from conflict or political violence and has become one of the preferred lenses through which to examine democratising states. Transitional justice processes and the mechanisms through which they work tend however to be prescriptive and top-down: they are created by elites, supported by an international community remote from the context and from indigenous understandings. There remains a dearth of praxis that interrogates the idea of a transitional justice driven by the grassroots. This study investigates victim mobilisation: one of the few ways in which the views of those most impacted by the legacies of violence can challenge such prescriptive approaches and impact in a transitional context. The bulk of victims of Nepal's conflict are poor and socially excluded, live in rural areas far from the capital, lack education and are ignorant of their rights. Social movements of conflict victims constitute one of the few routes to increasing victim agency in a transition which largely ignores them. This study attempts to understand how victims' understandings of their needs of transition diverge from those of elites, and the frames they use to both articulate their demands and around which they mobilise. This paper reports data from participatory action research undertaken with and by families of persons disappeared during Nepal's conflict, through an engagement with locally organised family associations. An effort is made to understand both the challenges and possibilities of victim mobilisation as a strategy to ensure agency of the most marginalised in a transitional justice process, and the remoteness of much of the elite agenda from victims' concerns.

Abstract

This paper engages with a set of problems that arise when science tries to settle questions of social and political significance. On a general level the paper addresses some of the ways in which the dead register in political life. More specifically, it evaluates the performance of forensic knowledge in settling contesting interpretations of past state violence. What the paper argues, against some of the claims made by the field of forensic anthropology, is that forensic truths do not settle the past but take their place within social, political and historical interpretations by which past violence is renegotiated and reinterpreted, in ways that are both conflicted and unpredictable. In order to make this argument the paper shows how the professionalization of forensic anthropological work in human rights is coterminous, temporally, with a particular set of political and legal conditions within and due to which the field has flourished, and looks at how these conditions have framed the particular claims made by the profession. It identifies distinctive 'faiths' of the field as scientific, probative, humanitarian, historical, political and deterrent, and shows how these are underpinned by a set of legal-scientific definitions, practices, technologies and materialities which impact upon how human rights and the politics of the past is thought, practiced and administered. It also shows how these faiths are intimately entwined with the characteristic claims of the field (both the knowledge and practice) of transitional justice. Further, the paper posits human remains as 'boundary objects' (Star and Greisemer, 1989) in order to argue that claims made by forensic anthropologists conceal a range of contests and conflicts around the social, political, legal and scientific significance of human remains in which multiple social agents are differently invested. The paper illustrates such conflicts with reference to the determination of the crime of genocide and to exhumations in Argentina. In summary, the paper examines some of the ways in which forensic work is embedded within a network of actors, artifacts and institutions that have different stakes in the interpretation of the past in order to historicise the central techniques of knowledge by which transitional justice is arbitrated and legitimized, and to demonstrate the indivisibility of scientific claims from the social and political contexts within science is operative, and upon which it claims to act with finality.

Abstract: Various explanatory perspectives focus on the different factors leading to mass crime. Some relate to the structural (social, political and ideological) factors, whereas others concern the social-psychological processes related to identity and social categorization (in-group solidarity and out-group antipathy), emotions or feelings (fear, insecurity, resentment), as well as social influence processes (obedience, conformity and submission to in-group norms).



The findings presented here stem from a broader interdisciplinary research project aiming at contributing to the evaluation of the legitimacy of international criminal justice. 18 interviews were carried with individuals accused by the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia for international crimes they committed personally or in which they were involved indirectly. Using a critical approach to their analysis, we demonstrate how their reconstructions of involvement are shaped by the social role, identity and relations the speaker refers to, as well as by the social context of the communicative situation. Our findings reveal that these individuals are not morally ignorant. Yet, they also support the claim that criminal accountability measures should consider the social processes underlying the normative changes which can pave the way for involvement in international crimes.

The talk sparked extensive discussion and the content of the work was included, in summary, in the Transitional Justice Methods Manual, one of the major outputs of the grant.

Abstract

This presentation will focus on a project that has involved the development of statistical tools for monitoring processes of criminal justice for crimes against humanity in Latin America by a domestic NGO from Argentina, the Centre of Legal and Social Studies (CELS). Since the early 2000s the region is facing a process of re-opening of criminal cases for crimes committed by military rule during the seventies and eighties, in the framework of a wider turn to accountability for past crimes that include other transitional justice mechanisms.

The first part will address the political context that contributed to its development and its diffusion to other Latin American processes (since 2009, this tool has been replicated by civil society actors from Chile, Peru and Uruguay).

The second part will refer to the methodological aspects regarding the design of the databases and the production of data: variables, scope, sources of information, data-collection. Practical and ethical aspects regarding the production of this data will be also addressed: the importance of a flexible design, issues on data confidentiality, data preservation and the possibility of this design to be replicated in other contexts.

The final part will address the most important findings of the project, nationally and regionally, by a series of graphics which illustrate the current status as well as the evolution of the Argentine criminal process for crimes against humanity between 2006 and 2012. The point here will be the influence the project has had in the advocacy strategies implemented by CELS to enhance the process and influence the authorities in charge. Some comparative findings that are the result of a joint work with the projects from Chile, Peru and Uruguay will also be presented, to illustrate the flexibility of the design and its potential to adapt to other national contexts in which these crimes are being investigated.

Abstract

In this talk, Dr. Akin Akinwumi will build on his research on the now iconic South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (SATRC) to show how transitional justice scholarship and practice ought to embrace more innovative methodological pathways and tools. Whilst the overall goal of his research into the SATRC was to draw analytic attention to the will to transform at the heart of the process, the project also represented an attempt to unsettle the assumptions of finality or closure associated with transitional justice. In the talk he will suggest that there has been a tendency to quickly draw a line under truth and reconciliation commissions (TRCs) once their mandates have been completed and official reports made public. In fact, as he will further point out, the tendency to see TRC processes as final or at least finalizing is more or less implicit in the research methods we favour (ethnography, interviews, statistics, and so on) and the ways we analyze data. His argument is that the methods used to formulate, implement, and assess transitional justice processes like TRCs ought to resist notions of finality or closure. In Ghostly Matters, Avery Gordon deploys the notion of &amp;quot;haunting&amp;quot; to stir the sociological imagination in new directions. Haunting is presented as &amp;quot;a very particular way of knowing what has happened or is happening&amp;quot; (2008: 8). This way of knowing follows Gordon's view that a ghost &amp;quot;imports a charged strangeness into the place or sphere that it is haunting, thus unsettling the proprietary and property lines that delimit a zone of activity or knowledge&amp;quot; (p. 63). Gesturing toward the spirit of Gordon's work, Dr. Akin Akinwumi will be proposing the use of haunting as a methodological tool for turning a critical eye on the pervasive finalizing outlook of TRC processes. Dr. Akin Akinwumi will suggest that atrocities disrupt linear succession and thus pose a serious challenge to the prevalent idea of making a clean break from the past - not merely in the everyday sense but also in research terms. In light of this perspective, he will suggest that being attentive to the troubled, incomplete, and haunted nature of TRC processes invites a more careful reading of TRC-related research data. Dr. Akin Akinwumi will make a case for the adoption of an open-ended methodological approach to interpreting the historical particularities of atrocities as well as official responses to them. Taking this sort of approach, he will suggest, broadens the landscape of transitional justice scholarship and practice to encompass how past atrocities make their presence felt and known beyond the timeline of TRC activities. Even more, this sort of approach allows transitional justice scholars and practitioners to approach research data on atrocities in a recursive fashion and thereby embrace new opportunities for knowing and analyzing transitional justice mechanisms and their impacts.

Abstract
Emerging technology has provided us new ways to record and publicize observed human rights violations. But we remain limited by what is observable, and many human rights violations are either unobserved or unrecorded. When we treat observed, recorded violations as the only violations that occur, we not only misinterpret patterns of violations, we also do a disservice to victims' whose stories have not yet been told. The data we often have access to in human rights research are convenience samples - samples which include an unknown proportion of the population and which have an unknown relationship to the population. Such data are insufficient to support answers to questions of interest, such as &amp;quot;Is violence increasing or decreasing?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Has more violence occurred in this region or that region?&amp;quot; Fortunately, the statistical method multiple systems estimation (MSE) provides a way to model the observation process and thus answer such questions through appropriate statistical inference. This lecture will present examples from the Human Rights Data Analysis Group's various projects to illustrate why drawing statistical inference from a single convenience sample is inappropriate and to highlight results of several MSE analyses.

The seminar series aimed at identifying the gaps and synergies in the way of knowing transitional justice. T The seminar led by Megan Price examined quantitative methods so as to assess human rights violations. The seminar argued for the use of Multi-System Estimation (MSE) as a statistical means to take account of human rights violations that may not have been reported to fact-finding groups.

swisspeace elected to continue to use the Transitional Justice Methods Manual in its activities and is exploring the possibility of building an application for further research off the broad basis created by this ESRC Knowledge Exchange.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2100</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Faculty of Law Research Support Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Oxford</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>RSF1314-61</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6EC957F8-1631-49A7-AF33-8CDF20043719</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>30000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Leverhulme Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>ECF2014-233</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>18EB691F-3C7D-46EE-AC5F-4ADDEDDCC406</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The objectives of this project were: 

? To map the various methods and methodologies used to determine the occurrence of serious human rights violations and wider societal harm. 
? To exchange information and interrogate the praxis and underlying epistemologies of the legal and non-legal responses to serious human rights violations 
? To establish links between orthodox and more innovative approaches used to determine the practice and impact of transitional justice processes on individuals and broader societal structures. These objectives were achieved through an innovative knowledge exchange method that combined an online discussion forum with inter-disciplinary roundtables and public seminars, a set of practice-oriented workshops in post-conflict countries and a final evaluation and implementation meeting.

The project led to four key findings:

? Focusing on forms of knowledge enables interdisciplinary academic research
? Workshops on methods and methodologies with civil society researchers and academics in transitional countries strengthens the development of practice-oriented training materials and highlights important ethical constraints when conducting research in post-conflict contexts.
? A focus on research methods provides a productive avenue through which to assess policy decisions relating to responses to serious human right violations in conflict zones.
? Research networks can be fostered through integrating web-based discussions with a series of research seminars and roundtable discussions. 

The project has led to three early impacts and one major future impact:

1) Civil Society and Academic partnership Impacts - 
The grant fostered key on-going international partnerships with swisspeace, a Swiss research institute with expertise on peace research, capacity building and practice based in Bern Switzerland; Fondation Hirondelle, a well-established and respected NGO comprising journalists and humanitarian aid professionals based in Geneva, Switzerland and academic researchers at the Institute of Criminology, KU Leuven based in Leuven, Belgium.

2) Career Development Impacts - 
The project facilitated the career development of the principal investigator (Dr. Nicola Palmer), the co-investigator (Dr. Briony Jones) and the post-doctoral researcher (Dr. Julia Viebach). Following the announcement of the award in August 2012, Dr. Palmer was appointed to a permanent academic post as lecturer in criminal law at the Dickson Poon School of Law, King's College London. In this role Dr. Palmer has been a Theme Leader in the ESRC supported Doctoral Training Centre. Through the winning of the grant Dr. Briony Jones consolidated her position as Senior Researcher and since then has been invited to play more strategic and management roles at swisspeace for the development of the organisation's research profile. While in the role of post-doctoral research, Dr. Julia Viebach was awarded her doctoral degree from the University of Marburg. Following the completion of the grant she was appointed as a Career Development Lecturer at the Centre for Criminology, University of Oxford and was awarded a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship and a Faculty of Law Research Support Fund.

3)Engagement Activities Impacts - 
The practice-oriented workshops in Rwanda and Kosovo and the publications of the 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual' provided the catalyst for a series of on-going engagement activities led by both civil society actors and academics. First, the dissemination of the methods manual in Rwanda lead to a further workshop being organised by the Refugee Law Project in Gulu in northern Uganda. Second, following the completion of the grant swisspeace has used the 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual' in a range of engagement activities including workshops in the Philippines and Switzerland. Finally, the 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual' was included as one of the key teaching tools in the Essex Summer School in Human Rights on Research Methods The summer school was attended by 50 policy makers, NGO sector staff and students. Organisations included the International Criminal Court (ICC); UNHRC, OHCHR, the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, the Danish Refugee Council, Freedom from Torture UK, the Association of Women for Research and Advocacy in Singapore, Open Society Justice Initiative, WHO in Geneva. Participants reported very positively on the training and on how it challenged their thinking on the methods current used in the designing, researching and implementing transitional justice.

1) Anticipated/Potential Future Impacts - 

The major future impact of this knowledge exchange project is the OTJR partnership with Fondation Hirondelle on developing and running an innovative on-line media platform, entitled: JusticeInfo.Net. This web-based platform will provide multimedia, multi-lingual real time coverage of transitional justice news, uncovering the facts, delving into background, and providing context, analysis and different perspectives and points of view. This platform will be a resource for journalists and a teaching tool as well as a news site, including interactive timelines, a transitional justice lexicon, biographies, and background information on conflict zones. OTJR's role will be to provide academic research contributions to the online platform. These contributions will include background information on conflicts, political parties, and transitional justice mechanisms, biographies of individuals, and analyses of central issues and themes in transitional justice.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7B41EDFF-E435-42D5-9584-4A221B1F0562</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project aimed to bridge the methodological divides within the practice and research of transitional justice, making scholarly research more accessible to actors implementing responses to atrocity. As a Knowledge Exchange, the project facilitated expertise-sharing among academics and practitioners through an online forum, a seminar series, a set of practice-oriented workshops, the development of a 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual' and the publication of a Special Edition of the Canadian Journal of Law and Society (forth-coming 2015). 

Key findings:

1) Exploring the nexus between policy decision-making and research methods 

? Finding: A focus on research methods provides a productive avenue through which to assess policy decisions relating to responses to serious human right violations in conflict zones.

? Activity: OTJR hosted an on-line debate examining the role of international monitors, such as the UN Group of Experts or human rights groups, in reporting on mass conflict. The discussion centred on donor responses to recent military activities in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Jason K. Stearns, director of the Rift Valley Institute's Usalama Project debated with Phil Clark, Lecturer in Comparative and International Politics at SOAS, University of London. The discussion ran from March until July 2013 and included moderation and guest commentaries from leading academics and policy think tanks. During this period the website was viewed by 3186 individual users, with the majority of web traffic coming from the United Kingdom, Rwanda, the United States of America, Switzerland, Belgium, Kenya, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, United Arab Emirates and Australia.

A focus on the process and methods used in reporting on human rights abuses highlighted key points of difference and welcome points of agreement between the contributors. Two key differences were whether donors can and should verify primary sources and whether international actors amplify or silence domestic reporting. While one clear point of agreement was that locally specific political knowledge should inform both report writing and decision-making.

? Output: OTJR website and on-line platform

2) Developing a network through research seminars and roundtable discussions

? Finding: Research networks can be fostered through integrating web-based discussions with a series of research seminars and roundtable discussions.

? Activities: From January 2013 to January 2014, OTJR and its civil society partner swisspeace, in collaboration with the Dickson Poon School of Law, King's College, London and the Leuven Institute of Criminology, Faculty of Law, KU Leuven, hosted 12 public seminars and 8 roundtable discussions. With attendees from barrister chambers involved in international criminal trials, academic institutions and third sector organisations, these exchanges drew together work conducted by political scientists, psychologists, international lawyers, literary writers, human rights activists and anthropologists. Each speaker provided a written paper in advance in order to enhance the discussions and exchanges. The seminars and roundtables were integrated into the development of the new OTJR website, providing a set of pod-casts, blog posts and seminar abstracts as an on-line resources relating to the methods currently deployed in the study of transitional justice. 

? Outputs: OTJR/swisspeace Podcasts, Seminars and Workshops; Blog posts: Summaries of key questions raised in the roundtable discussions; Transitional Justice Methods Manual 

3) Building research capacity and fostering ethical research in transitional justice

? Findings: Workshops on methods and methodologies with civil society researchers and academics in transitional countries strengthens the development of practice-oriented training materials and highlights important ethical constraints when conducting research in post-conflict contexts.

? Activities: On the 16th-17th July and 18th- 19th September 2013, OTJR and swisspeace hosted two practice-oriented workshop, the first in Kigali, Rwanda and the second in Prishtina, Kosovo. Working with locally based partners, the workshops were structured around a draft version of the 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual' that had been developed through the OTJR/swisspeace roundtable discussions in Oxford and London. This allowed for direct feedback and input into the content and uses for the manual. Seventy participants attended the workshops, with representation from local and international Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), the civil service, current members of parliament and students and academics from across the two countries. Following these exchanges the manual was revised, published and launched as part of the Final Monitoring and Evaluation Meeting in Bern, Switzerland on 14th January 2014. 

? Output: Transitional Justice Methods Manual

4) Focusing on forms of knowledge enables interdisciplinary academic research

? Finding: A focus on how the form through which knowledge on human rights abuse is exchanged and transferred allows for inter-disciplinary work in the field of transitional justice.

? Activity: The papers prepared for the roundtable discussions were structured around the three research questions for the project that examined the different ways through which human rights violations are currently identified, the methods used to respond to them and the dominant and innovative approaches to examining the impact of these responses. In response to a competitive international call, a proposal to publish a selection of these papers as a Special Issue has been accepted by the Canadian Journal for Law and Society.

? Output: Special Edition of the Canadian Journal of Law and Society (forth-coming 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project identified civil society and advocacy groups working on transitional justice and international criminal lawyers as the two major non-academic beneficiaries of the project's activities. The potential use of the project's outputs for each of these groups will be discussed in turn.

First and foremost, the project has built a strong professional partnership with swisspeace, the collaborating civil society partner. This partnership across the academy and third sector created the foundation for the development of the 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual'. The manual is specifically geared towards use by civil society groups and think tanks in non-academic contexts. All participants involved in the practice-oriented workshops have received an electronic copy of the 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual'. There will be follow-up on how these participants make use of this publication. In addition, the workshops themselves have the potential to lead to the establishment of research streams in transitional countries, adding to the on-going capacity development of civil society. 

The OTJR network development has the potential to continue to enhance the exchange of knowledge between scholars, students and international criminal lawyers. Practising lawyers in international criminal law presented work and participated in the project roundtable discussions and seminars. These activities have led OTJR to arrange a further seminar with Xabier Agirre, Head of the Investigative Division in the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court. There is potential for these types of collaborations to continue. The exploitation routes are linked to the outcomes and activities that have been achieved in the four areas of influence discussed above.

1) The on-line platform provides the capacity to host on-going and future debates pertinent to the study and practice of transitional justice. In addition, the OTJR network has been solidified and developed over the course of the project. The partnerships with swisspeace, the Leuven Institute of Criminology at KU Leuven and Fondation Hirondelle, a Swiss NGO and media outlet, have resulted in the ongoing development of further grant applications. The website now provides a comprehensive record of all of the OTJRs activities since the groups inception in 2007 and offers a hub for retaining connections between participants involved in the OTJR activities.

2) Use of the 'Transitional Justice Methods Manual' by civil society groups, think tanks and NGO's in post-conflict countries

The dissemination of the methods manual in Rwanda led to a further workshop being organised by the Refugee Law Project in Gulu, northern Uganda. The publications of the manual and its distribution to all participants involved in the workshops in Rwanda and Kosovo and the manual launch hosted in Bern offers the opportunity for further deployment of the manual as a teaching and facilitating tool.

3) Enhancement of the academic impact of the Special Edition of the Canadian Journal of Law and Society 

The reputation of the journal and the fact that the proposal was selected from an open international call will enhance the reach and impact of the work within the academy. The profile of the Special Edition will be enhanced through a collaborative launch with the Leuven Institute of Criminology at KU Leuven, if a funding application to the Belgian Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences is successful.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AB2FEA4F-614D-4EA1-901A-BB9B6FD0BBC9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://otjr.crim.ox.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The OTJR website was redesigned to incorporate an online debate platform.
