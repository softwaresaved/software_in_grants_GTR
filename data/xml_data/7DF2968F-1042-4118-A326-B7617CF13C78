Host innate immune cells (e.g. macrophages) engulf and trap bacteria in membrane-bound vesicles known as phagosomes. Engulfed pathogens, however, disarm macrophages and counteract immunity by deploying proteins (effectors) that subvert key cellular pathways.
 
The host cell cytoskeleton's critical role in both detection of bacterial pathogens and mobilization of antibacterial responses is an emerging theme in infection biology. Indeed, pathogen-induced disorganization of the actin network is a remarkable anti-host strategy, also perceived by macrophages as a danger signal driving inflammation and cell death. However, the actin network in the context of chronic diseases that impair macrophage functions (e.g. cystic fibrosis, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) has not been explored. We and others discovered that cystic fibrosis (CF) gene-defective macrophages fail to clear engulfed bacteria and play a central role in maintaining the chronic inflammation state associated with disease. Based on the CF model, we hypothesize that intracellular pathogens engulfed by macrophages, combined with an underlying chronic defect, induce disorganization of the actin network that leads to a highly proinflammatory state.

We will examine this hypothesis using the intracellular opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia, which infects 2-10% of CF patients worldwide, rapidly accelerating their clinical decay. Unlike other CF pathogens, Burkholderia cenocepacia does not reside in biofilms in the lungs of patients but primarily within macrophages. We established Burkholderia cenocepacia as a model organism for cellular microbiology. Specifically, a Burkholderia cenocepacia type VI-secretion system (T6SS-Bc) disrupts the actin network and elicits pyroptosis in macrophages (cell death with exaggerated proinflammatory responses). These phenotypes depend on TecA (&amp;quot;T6SS effector protein affecting cytoskeletal Architecture&amp;quot;), a novel toxin recently discovered in our laboratory that inactivates Rho GTPases. This landmark discovery underpins the proposed study combining cellular and molecular microbiology approaches to investigate how intracellular Burkholderia cenocepacia manipulates the macrophages' actin network. We will address 3 questions:

(i)How TecA is secreted by the T6SS-Bc?
(ii)How defective actin polymerization is sensed by the Pyrin inflammasome?
(iii) What is the status of the Pyrin inflammasome in Burkholderia cenocepacia infected CF gene-defective human peripheral monocytes?

Understanding how opportunistic pathogens modulate the macrophages' actin network to drive inflammation will enable the discovery of new checkpoints for controlling dysregulated inflammation secondary to bacterial infection, which could be targeted to develop novel therapies to treat patients with chronic, underlying immune disorders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our goal is to understand how intramacrophage opportunistic pathogens, in conjunction with an underlying chronic condition, drive actin network defects leading to exaggerated inflammation. In Aim 1 we will functionally characterise TecA by (i) Investigating its mechanism of secretion via the T6SS, and (ii) Identifying novel TecA targets in macrophages and whether TecA plays a role in other T6SS-mediated phenotypes. We will address whether TecA binds to the inner surface of the ring-like Hcp hexamers or to other key proteins of the T6SS apparatus. The studies will involve co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) with and without crosslinking using Hcp- and TecA-specific antibodies and also combinations of mutant strains lacking one or more T6SS core components. Using purified TecA-FLAG or TecA-6xHis as baits we will isolate complexes and examine their composition by mass spectrometry (MS). A variation of this approach will also be used to address the second part of this aim, where we will perform Co-IPs with macrophage cell lysates to identify TecA-binding eukaryotic partners. We will also use a candidate approach by directly examining the effects of TecA on additional GTPases such a Cdc42, Rab7 and others and also to determine if TecA is responsible for defects in NADPH oxidase assembly and phagocytic capacity. 

In Aim 2 we will decode how the Pyrin inflammasome senses defective actin polymerization by (i) demonstrating that Pyrin recruited to the sites of ectopic actin nucleation upon infection with Burkholderia; (ii) Identifying Pyrin-interacting proteins recruited in a TecA-dependent fashion to sites of ectopic actin nucleation; and (iii) assessing the status of the Pyrin inflammasome in Burkholderia-infected, CFTR-defective human peripheral monocytes. These experiments involve a combination of cell biology and biochemical approaches probing various potential pathways for Pyrin recruitment and activation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will result in novel and significant contributions to UK science and UK knowledge economy, which are outlined as follows:

1) The main path to impact therefore will be through publication of the research in peer-reviewed, open access journals. Publications will be complemented by the presentation of data at national and international scientific conferences.

2) Our proposal provides fundamental research that has relevance to healthcare (biopharmaceuticals). The common theme in terms of public benefit arising from this research is the potential to lead to life- enhancing applications when antibiotic resistance becomes more widespread. The problem of antibiotic resistance is even more critical in the case of infections by opportunistic pathogens. The PI is heavily engaged with the UK Cystic Fibrosis Trust and will work with the Trust to disseminate research findings widely to cross-disciplinary audiences beyond the academic setting (for example CF patients/parents groups). This has the aim of promoting systematic studies to translate findings from this research into novel therapeutics.

3) Our current proposal aims to fundamental discoveries. However, the outcome of this research could lead to future collaborations with medicinal chemists to screen and test novel compounds or drug libraries searching for molecules that can impede the bacterial secretion of pathogenic factors We will also work with our local Research and Development Office as well as InvestNI to obtain financial support to explore the more promising compounds for commercial development.

4) This project will contribute to the career development of the PDRAs appointed to the project by ensuring additional training and experience. Similar skills training will be made available to other participants in PhD, MSc and undergraduate positions.

5) The relevance of this research to the health and biotechnology sectors will benefit public engagement to inform and educate the public about opportunities arising from a knowledge-based economy and to educate about science in general. We intend to take full advantage of available opportunities to do so through QUB outreach activities and the media. Furthermore, we will use available opportunities to disseminate information about published research success to the general media through the Press and Publicity Unit at QUB.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>343132</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P022480/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
