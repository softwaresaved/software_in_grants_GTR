They look like normal cells but behave like the dead ones until stimulated by proteins called the Resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs). Rpfs are constantly sectereted by normal growing bacteria and play an important role in making of cell envelope. However, sleeping or dormant bacteria do not produce the Rpfs. The main goal of this project is to find out how Rpfs wake-up sleeping cells. Rpfs are enzymes which digest bacterial cell wall (like lyzosyme) but unlike the latter they don't kill cells and somehow modify their envelope. Rpfs may simply break quite inflexible cell wall of sleeping cells and make them 'free' to grow and expand. In more sophisticated model fragments of cell wall, released by Rpfs during digestion, have a very special function as signalling molecules. In other words they are waking-up messages for dormant cells. These 'signals' bind to other molecules on the bacterial surface and initiate a complex system called a protein kinase cascade, a well described mechanisms of cell regulation in multicellular organisms. To address both hypotheses the investigator will isolate the major part of bacterial envelope, called murein and digest it with different Rpfs. The resulting products will be used for resuscitation of dormant cells and their composition will be analysed and characterised. Other experiments will be designed to establish what bonds the Rpfs cut in murein and how this cleavage influences the structure of bacterial cell envelope. In separate part of the project the investigators will attempt to understand how bacterial cells control the enzymes which able to destroy them by 'eating' bacterial envelope. Rpfs proteins will be applied as an example of such cell-wall degrading enzymes. The results of the project will not only satisfy scientific curiosity on bacterial cell function but also provide novel methods for manipulating of physiological condition of bacteria and further improving their application in biotechnology, medicine and specifically for combating of persisting infections caused by dormant bacteria.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Rpfs are a family of proteins secreted by actively growing cells. They resuscitate non-replicating bacteria and stimulate growth of cells in nutrient poor and stressful conditions. Rpfs are cell-wall hydrolysing enzymes and their enzymatic activity is essential for the biological effects. However, the precise mechanisms of Rpf-mediated resuscitation as well as the specificity of Rpf enzymes and released products remain unknown. The investigators will address two current hypotheses explaining the phenomenon of Rpf-mediated resuscitation of mycobacteria (i) Rpfs directly modify murein specific to dormant cells and enables growth activation; (ii) Rpf-derived muropeptides serve as signalling molecules that stimulate bacterial resuscitation. The proposed experiments will fill the existing gap in the Rpf-related research by identifying the bonds cleaved by Rpfs in murein and characterising structure of Rpf-derived muropeptides. Alternate sources of murein will be used for these experiments, including E. coli murein which is naturally susceptible to Rpf digestion, surrogate murein produced in genetically modified E. coli and mycobacterial peptidoglycan. The results will provide a basis for production of Rpf-derived muropeptides required for structural and physiological studies. It is likely that Rpf activity is modulated by other proteins. These will be searched for in a novel two plasmid screen for extracellular protein interactions based on the ability of Rpfs to induce E. coli lysis in vivo. The findings have the potential to enable controlled production of Rpf-dependent cells and other Rpf-related reagents. Delivery of the proposed project will result in better understanding of fundamental biological processes and improvement of Rpf application in industry and medicine.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will impact on basic science by uncovering the mechanisms of bacterial survival and resuscitation of dormant cells or 'revival of immortals'. Apart of educational value this knowledge will provide a basis for scientific experiments and design of novel methods. The PI is aware of difficulties in production of Rpf-dependent cells, important model organisms for study of non-replicating persistence, and determined to explore new methodologies for establishment of physiological assays for Rpf proteins. Development of reliable procedure for production of muropeptides and their application in structural biology is another important result emerging from this project. The proposed programme will also impact on applied sciences by offering novel opportunities for drug design, development of diagnostic tools and means for improvement of industrially important microorganisms. It is generally accepted that non-replicating bacteria are tolerant for antibiotics; therefore knowledge on reactivation of such microorganisms will promote formulation of novel strategies for chemotherapy. The wider translational potential includes detection of pathogenic bacteria in environment), control of disease transmission and reactivation. Altogether these useful applications will impact on human well-being and promote scientific progress.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>314941</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Dundee Cell Products</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Phosphoproteomics study</gtr:description><gtr:id>6ED7B106-6A06-4962-B1A6-918F61F6729A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We established molecular mechanisms of PknB essentiality in mycobacteria.

Generation of muropeptides and their application in resuscitation and growth assays as well in PknB activation assays. Muropeptides do not resuscitate dormant mycobacteria. 
2. Development of in vitro and in vivo models for generation of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria. Treatment of M. smegmatis with meropenem resulted in rapid reproducible generation of non-culturable and Rpf-dependent mycobacteria. In separate experiments we demonstrated that the in vivo environment accelerates formation of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria.
3. Generation of mycobacterial strains over-expressing L,D-transpeptidases and PknB which can be used for drug screening Development of strains over-expressing Rpfs into E. coli periplams; demonstration of reliable lysis of E. coli.
4. Discovered molecular mechanisms of serene/threonine protein kinase B (PknB) essentiality in mycobacteria.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Tuberculosis remains one of the greatest challenges for the Global Health system. Moreover bovine tuberculosis affects production animals in the UK and other European countries. Our findings provide novel insights into mechanisms of persisting mycobacterium bovis infection and suggest that significant proportions of mycobacteria generated during infection in animals cannot be detected using standard media. Therefore our in vivo model for generation of Resuscitation-promoting factor dependent M. bovis BCG can be used for investigation of molecular markers of latent/persisting infection and drug design. Generation of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria may also explain previously published data on detection of mycobacteria in environmental samples using molecular techniques. Our data suggest that the existence of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria should be taken into consideration for development of diagnostic methods. 
We have also developed molecular tools and strains which can be used for scientific research and for education purpose. The results obtained within the project contribute to our current understanding of bacterial dormancy and resuscitation. Finally we demonstrated that the strain over-expressing Rpfs can be employed ad host for production of other recombinant proteins. These strain do not require specialized methods of disruption as they easily lyse upon induction of Rpf expression. This concept can be used for other industrially important microorganisms (for example, Corynebacteria and Streptomyces).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AFFEDBE3-D3CC-4048-95E3-1E68F6713546</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Reagents and SOP for detection of Rpf-dependent mycobacteria isolated from infected mice or infected tissue</gtr:description><gtr:id>703EFE82-A305-4BD9-BB1D-B98F8AC0D966</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No impact at the moment (the methodology has being validated by researchers)</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Assays for detection of  Rpf-dependent mycobacteria from tissue samples</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms -
