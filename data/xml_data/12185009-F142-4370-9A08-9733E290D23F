There is an urgent need to lower the incidence or delay the onset of both conditions by lifestyle-related interventions. Dietary whey protein acts in the gut to affect satiety and post-meal glucose levels by increasing GLP-1 and insulin release. We aim to identify the whey bioactive(s) in order to develop a more potent whey protein supplement/food component. The project involves characterisation of the bioactive(s) via in vitro technologies working with whey protein experts to optimise fractionation of whey adding value to a sometimes waste product. This project is a necessary forerunner to human supplementation studies prior to procedure to EFSA health claims and the development of supplements and food components.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project will focus on the development of a whey protein product with enhanced satiating/satiety effects and the ability to lower post-meal glucose levels, coupled to low processing artefacts followed by the development of concept products, including, foods and drinks. Product development will be informed by palatability testing and consumer studies. The project will be conducted in three phases: 
1. Whey fraction production and selection of commercial products. 
2. In vitro demonstration of modified whey fractions in the regulation of enzyme activity and hormone release in laboratory studies.
3. Palatability studies, product formulation for supplements, food and drink product development and consumer studies.
Phase 1 - Whey sourcing fractionation and analysis. This phase will include a summary of satiating and insulinotropic properties of whey; a summary of available technologies for whey production, and an assessment of the likelihood of processing artefact formation by these processes.
Phase 2 - Identification of active whey components. This phase will identify the whey protein products that increase the release of a gut hormone, glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and inhibits the enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), that breaks down GLP-1. 
Phase 3 Product development and consumer studies utilising products from Phases 1 and 2.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Consortium has been specifically built to maximise adoption of the project findings incorporating them into production and marketing processes for products including foods and drinks. IP protection will be sought where appropriate and subject to the confines of any protection as research findings are published in relevant peer-reviewed academic journals. Initial results will be presented at specialist international meetings. 

RINH is part of the University of Aberdeen where the Communications team promotes the University's profile via press releases on University research initiatives. The project will, as appropriate, be promoted to the wider commercial community, including in Scotland the Scottish Enterprise Food and Health Innovation Service. 

The indirect economic, social and environmental benefits of this proposal will be significant.
ECONOMIC Beyond the benefits to the consortium, this project will brings economic benefits to cheese manufacturers, by adding value to whey protein. Proven EFSA health claims will provide a competitive advantage for the whey product and will be exclusive to the consortium for 5 years enabling the UK to dominate this market in Europe. Based on experience within the consortium it is expected that first products would be ready for sale in 2015-2016. The IP and value stream will be shared by the partners according to a consortium agreement signed prior to the start of the project. This project will also bring significant social and economic benefits derived from amelioration of obesity and uncontrolled blood glucose. UK Government public health policy has identified the urgent need to lower the incidence, delay the onset and manage the consequences of Type 2 diabetes by non pharmaceutical lifestyle related interventions.
SOCIAL BENEFITS
Obesity has a severe impact on health, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, some cancers, heart and liver disease as well as mental health impacts. Elevated blood glucose levels, typical of Type 2 diabetes, cause vascular damage which initiates a number of serious, life threatening diseases. Along with many developed countries the UK government has identified obesity and related disorders as a major focus for public health initiatives. It is known that dietary whey protein has beneficial effects on both satiety and on post-meal glucose levels by increasing GLP-1 secretion from the gut which in turn increases insulin secretion in a glucose dependent manner which means that it is a safe approach to blood glucose control with no side effects. 
ENVIRONMENT
This project will have a positive environmental impact. The proposal uses raw materials which would otherwise be dried as low value whey powder at relatively high costs or disposed of through landfill. The project will produce not only whey powder but a liquid whey product that will contain 80-90% water. This avoids evaporation by spray drying which is currently used to produce whey powder. To dry 1000 litres of product approximately 3000 kg of steam is needed with one kg of steam corresponding to around 2.26 GJ/ton of energy. Thus, a large sized creamery producing around 200 million litres of whey a year could save the cost of up to 136.000 GJ of energy a year while producing a product with a higher value.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242136</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Joint Annual Scientific Meeting of the Nutrition Society of NZ and the Nutrition Society of Australia Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BBC62D9-0D3D-4C43-89DF-B3031638EBCB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented a short talk on &amp;quot;The effect of whey protein on GLP-1 secretion from human gut explants compared with STC-1 cells&amp;quot; reporting an outcome from our TSB funded research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a modified whey protein with a potentially larger impact on GLP-1 release which should increase insulin release and thereby reduce post meal glycaemia.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are awaiting the results of testing our modified whey protein in a short term human supplementation study looking at post meal glucose levels and satiety</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FB9C1A46-5A76-4AA9-8EC0-8C5A2699ED93</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/K021095/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>446B7E7F-04EB-4121-9CC6-9171277E00DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diet &amp; health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C7A88EDD-F02E-4CF4-B7E9-E33C946EBD49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
