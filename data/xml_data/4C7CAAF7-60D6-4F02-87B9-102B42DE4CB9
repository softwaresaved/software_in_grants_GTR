It represents the output of millions of hours of listening and transcribing broadcasts - a colossal collection of typed transcripts documenting international radio outputs during the Second World War and the Cold War, from 1939-1980. The network will bring together archival practitioners and researchers from the fields of twentieth century history, BBC institutional history, propaganda and intelligence, radio studies, translation and language studies, and digital humanities to explore the potential of this vast collection, provide expertise on its use and promotion, and examine possibilities for further research and collaboration. The work of the BBC Monitoring Service is international in scope and the research network will reflect this by involving representatives from academic institutions and equivalent archives worldwide, thus opening up the collection for later projects that involve international collaboration. 

It should be noted that the BBC Monitoring Service's Summary of World Broadcasts/Daily Digest - daily summaries of the news broadcast by states worldwide - have been used by scholars, who have had access to them on microfiche in libraries worldwide since the 1970s. IWM's collection consists of the raw unedited transcripts from which the summaries were drawn. The proposed network's focus, therefore, will be on the ways in which this very much larger body of unexplored material held by IWM can be used.

The network will explore the collection, suggest ways of providing greater access to and understanding of its content, and encourage engagement from a wide and diverse range of users. The network will also seek to develop future research directions to explore the full potential of this resource. These aims will be achieved through a series of four multidisciplinary workshops to address four key themes: 

1. BBC Monitoring and the World: the service and its role in international politics and diplomacy 

2. The difficulties of translation and intelligence-gathering faced by the Service; 

3. The BBC Monitoring Service as an institution;

4. The archive as a physical entity and the opportunities presented by digital technologies to allow greater public access to the collection, increasing understanding of the output of the BBC Monitoring Service, and providing new educational resources. 

The wider aims of the network are to establish and promote the value of the collection for researchers; to encourage recognition of the collection as an important part of British heritage, and to explore the digital potential of the collection.

In order to achieve this, the network will seek to build international relationships with researchers; establish a dedicated microsite on the IWM website and publish the outcomes of the workshops in academic journals and the popular press. 

The network will led by IWM's Head of Research, Suzanne Bardgett, who has highlighted the likely value of the collection to the academic world, and co-supervised two PhDs on the subject, and Professor Jean Seaton, Official Historian of the BBC and Professor of Media History, University of Westminster. 

The Advisory Group includes: Professor Sheila Anderson, King's College London; Professor Christopher Andrew, Cambridge University; Dr Peter Busch, King's College London; Professor Hilary Footitt, Reading University; Robert Seatter, Head of BBC History; Dr Alban Webb, The Open University; Chris Westcott, Director of BBC Monitoring Service and Rosy Wolfe, Head of Business Development, BBC Monitoring Service. 

The BBC is a committed Project Partner.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is anticipated that the network will have impact in the following areas, and for the following groups:

Archivists managing equivalent collections worldwide 
During the preparation of this bid, a number of overseas archives were approached and there was a very positive response, notably from the former Vice President for Government Publications from Readex USA, the Director of Narodowego Archiwum Cyfrowego (Polish National Digital Archives), and the Radio Free Europe Archivist from the Wilson Center, USA.

Imperial War Museums 
The network will increase access to and raise awareness and understanding of the IWM's largest collection. Increasing the access to, and public understanding of, this nationally significant collection will provide better value for public money. The network will also contribute to IWM's strategic aim of raising and extending its research profile by further strengthening links with academics and institutions within the UK, and building new connections with academics and institutions around the world. 

The BBC
The network's outputs will provide examples of the wider role of the BBC by highlighting how the BBC Monitoring Service has played a significant part in intelligence gathering since 1939 (for both the UK and the United States) and provided information that has been used to great effect to help British political and economic interests during the Second World War and the Cold War. The network will also provide benefits to the BBC through opening up links to other institutions, including the IWM, universities, and institutions across the world.

General public 
The network aims to engage with a broad spectrum of the public by making the workshop outcomes available on the IWM website. IWM Research will host and support dedicated pages on its website that will allow the public to learn more about the network, with content ranging from downloadable podcasts, blog posts and comment pieces, through to digitised examples of the material held within the collection. In addition, innovative means of engagement will be developed via social media, in order to promote the collection further, and direct interested parties to the relevant area of the IWM website. IWM will host a free public event to showcase the collection and share the outcomes of the network. 

Finally, the PI will organise at least one feature on the collection in the national press, and further examples in popular history magazines and on the radio.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32751</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>BBC Monitoring</gtr:department><gtr:description>Partnership with BBC Monitoring</gtr:description><gtr:id>A6F1E711-2604-4DDC-977D-93D093428C31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Senior BBC staff and current and former BBC Monitoring staff attended the five workshops that have taken place as part of the research network.

A very engaging exchange took place between academics specialising in linguistics, media history and international affairs and those working 'at the coalface' - the first time that BBC Monitoring's operations had received this kind of scholarly attention. The blogs arising from the first workshop testify to the value to both BBC Monitoring and the wider public of hearing these specialists reflect upon their work. Once their blogs are available they can be read by modern language students considering joining the BBC Monitoring Service as a possible career, and generally provide an illuminating insight for the public into this highly specialist profession. 

Secondly, following the first two workshops held in June 2015 - 'Translation and Intelligence' and 'BBC Monitoring as an Institution', the three Theme Leaders who had organised the second workshop - Professor Jean Seaton (Co-investigator), Dr Alban Webb, and Dr Rosaleen Hughes - wrote a summary entitled 'BBC Monitoring: a national asset' and submitted it to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to inform the 2015 Defence Review then being prepared. 

Their summary drew attention to the widespread agreement at the meetings that BBC Monitoring was a national asset of very far-reaching value. The authors pointed to 'the historically-rooted professional capacities of BBCM and the fact that they are increasingly important in identifying, verifying, analysing, contextualising and enriching open sources. In crises, monitoring offers tactical advantages and an early warning system, but can only do this because of its strategic insight and understanding gained over a long period of time'.

At a time when news agencies and newspapers facing economic difficulties are cutting back on foreign bureaux and direct reporting from the field, BBCM's capacity to verify material was especially important in dealing with increased propaganda material produced by a variety of state and non-state actors. It was difficult to predict which areas of the world would be problematic for the UK in the future and BBC Monitoring's systematic and highly developed approach were invaluable in this regard. A number of case-studies were cited where BBC Monitoring had provided timely and valuable information which had served the national interest. 

The point was made that if BBC Monitoring did not exist it would be impossible to obtain the same products and services from elsewhere and that if it were to cease to exist it will be extremely difficult to rebuild. It was also noted that funding through the license fee was unrepresentative of the balance of the actual use of the Service by the BBC and Whitehall and urged that it should be funded on a more sustainable basis.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1E45CA94-4798-4A70-8821-85374E29297C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The BBC Monitoring Transcripts project has achieved its goals very satisfactorily over the past year.

There has been effective collaboration between the BBC and the IWM: the former providing facilities, contacts and a shared online space for accessing documents; the latter ensuring that the fruits of the academic engagement have been fully shared with the BBC. 

Five workshops took place between June 2015 and January 2016. The first was held at BBC Monitoring's headquarters at Caversham Park, the building which has housed the operation since 1942. Focussing on Translation and Intelligence, it welcomed a number of former and current monitors who contributed valuable insights into the mechanics of their work and how BBCM had responded to particular world events. Participants - who included language specialists - thus gained an insight into the internal workings of monitoring: the workings of shifts and rotas; the challenges of poor reception; the emergence of unfamiliar terms as regimes adopted new ideologies or as industries modernised. Internal technical developments such as the introduction of satellite monitoring of television and the computerisation of the editorial operation were also considered. The monitors took a strong interest in the project and several have contributed blogs about it.

The second workshop focussed on BBC Monitoring as an Institution. Here the focus was on the wide variety of organisations that have benefited from Monitoring's 'window on the world' and its overall value as a tool of 'soft power'. A number of senior journalists, former diplomats and others were able to comment on the value of BBC Monitoring in offering 'the first glimpse behind the curtain of events'. 

The third and fourth workshops focussed on the Second World War and the Cold War. Those academics who either visited IWM Duxford and read transcripts in the archive, or who accessed a specially-established online repository, were unanimous in seeing the value of the raw transcripts: 'wafer thin sheets of close spaced typescript many of the twentieth century's most significant historical events literally leap from the files'. 20-minute papers were given on topics ranging from the broadcast sources used by the Oneg Shabbas historians in the Warsaw Ghetto to regime change in Rumania 1940-45; from the Cuban Missile Crisis to Eastern Bloc reactions to the 1976 Soweto Uprising.

The fifth considered the challenges of digitising the collection, and the opportunities that might arise from that. It was addressed by, among others, Bill Thompson, of the BBC's archive development team, who shared some of the issues which had arisen with BBC's Genome project (Radio Times listings, 1923-2009), and discussed with academics the importance of continued access to the collection.

Interviews conducted with those attending the workshop will appear on the project webpages, together with the papers delivered, a series of blogs and sample transcripts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The network has engaged both academic and non-academic audiences. We welcomed a large number of attendees from BBC Monitoring itself, including senior staff members, who have come to enrich their understanding of the practice of monitoring and the historic collection. We have also engaged those with interests in security and diplomacy, journalism, and linguistics.

IWM has dedicated webpages that allow the public to learn more about the work of the network. We are in the process of uploading all the academic papers which were presented at the workshops, which will be freely available. We have commissioned a number of blog posts written by network participants which are also shortly to be uploaded onto the website. These posts are aimed at a broad audience, in order to be of interest to general as well as specialist readers.

We have also developed a series of vox-pop videos with each of the workshop participants, and these will shortly be made available on YouTube and linked via the IWM website. It is hoped that these videos will encourage public engagement with the collection, as well as advocating its academic significance.
