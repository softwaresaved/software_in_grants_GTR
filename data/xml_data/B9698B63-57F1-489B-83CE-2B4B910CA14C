Upon infection, the immune system is rapidly activated, to ensure the threat is dealt with as quickly as possible. However, in healthy individuals it is vital that the immune system is kept in a resting state to prevent tissues of the body from being attacked; a process that results in debilitating autoimmune disease. A vital area of research is concerned with understanding the pathways and molecules that control the balance between a resting and active immune system. We have recently identified a vital pathway which prevents the immune system from attacking tissues of the body. When a protein molecule called integrin alphavbeta8 is not present on the dendritic cells of the immune system, severe autoimmune disease occurs. The work proposed here aims to study this pathway in more detail, looking at which specific types of cell in the immune system are important, and to determine what happens to this pathway during active immune responses to infection. Such work will provide important insights into how animals and humans successfully deal with infection, and how the immune system is tightly regulated to prevent autoimmune disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The immune system has evolved to protect the body from infection by quickly detecting and destroying harmful pathogens. However, in normal circumstances, it is vital that the immune system is kept in a resting state, to prevent harmful immune responses directed against self-tissues, leading to autoimmune disease. An important molecule in the regulation of immunity is the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). TGF-beta is an important anti-inflammatory cytokine, as shown by the TGF-beta1 knockout mouse, which dies from multi-organ autoimmune disease due to unregulated immune responses. TGF-beta is synthesized and secreted from cells as part of a latent protein complex, and needs to be activated to exert effects on TGF-beta receptor-expressing cells. Therefore, increasing our knowledge of how TGF-beta is activated in vivo will be vital in understanding how TGF-beta regulates the immune system. Our recent studies have uncovered a novel role for the integrin alphavbeta8 in activating TGF-beta in the adaptive immune system. Mice lacking integrin alphavbeta8 on antigen-presenting dendritic cells develop severe autoimmune disease, characterised by unregulated T-cell activation and severe colitis. This disease results from a reduced ability of dendritic cells to activate TGF-beta via integrin alphavbeta8. However, many crucial biological questions remain. Which types of dendritic cell are involved in this pathway? What is the role of this pathway at times of immune challenge? What happens to this pathway once the immune system has successfully eradicated an infection? This project will utilise conditional knockout mouse models to enhance our understanding of an important pathway in regulation of the immune system. Specifically, we will investigate the role of integrin-mediated TGF-beta activation in control of immune responses. This work will provide new insights into how the adaptive immune system is regulated at rest and in response to infection.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>412416</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>571000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>TGF-beta activation by gut dendritic cells: identifying a critical pathway in regulations of chronic parasitic infection</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C5EDE336-6551-4C30-AFF3-02F798BAE7C4</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the research proposal was to determine important molecular mechanisms that control immune responses in the intestine. Specifically, we aimed to determine novel pathways by which an important type of immune cell in the intestine, the dendritic cell, regulates immune responses to promote a healthy gut. During the course of the proposal, we produced two major findings. 

Our first finding was that a specialised type of dendritic cell is key in dampening the immune system in the intestine. Specifically, by expression of a molecule called integrin alphav beta8, these specialised dendritic cells activate an important molecule called TGF-beta, which in turn promotes the development of a cell called a regulatory T-cell. These regulatory T-cells are vital in the maintenance of health in the intestine. We have published this work in a high profile journal (Worthington JJ et al (2011), Gastroenterology, 141(5): 1802-1812), and have recently initiated studies in humans to determine whether such pathways exist and whether they are altered in inflammatory bowel disease.

Our second finding was that the integrin av?8-dendritic cell-TGF? pathway is key in regulating responses to infection. Specifically, mice lacking this pathway were completely protected from infection with the intestinal worm parasite Trichuris muris. The preliminary findings formed the basis for a successful grant application to the MRC, looking into the molecular mechanisms by which lack of the integrin ?8-DC-TGF? pathway was important in promoting chronic parasite infection in the gut.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are now taking our findings into human subjects, to determine whether similar pathways are present in the human intestine during health and inflammation. Such work will validate the potential role of the integrin av?8-TGF? pathway in the immune system in promoting a healthy gut. 

Additionally, it is hypothesised that targeting integrin av?8 during the development of chronic parasite infection in the intestine may be successful in promoting parasite clearance. More work is required to test the validity of this hypothesis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>49E215D5-4FC7-419D-83BA-6B1D8E5A3314</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1604D406-7E7B-4ACC-9DE5-0310813BEE0E"><gtr:id>1604D406-7E7B-4ACC-9DE5-0310813BEE0E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inflammatory cues enhance TGF? activation by distinct subsets of human intestinal dendritic cells via integrin av?8.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mucosal immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/16782fb4dcf17e36c22e83a66e6b7d0d"><gtr:id>16782fb4dcf17e36c22e83a66e6b7d0d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fenton TM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1933-0219</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F0527EBC-AEE4-46CE-AA6C-937FF13BB28E"><gtr:id>F0527EBC-AEE4-46CE-AA6C-937FF13BB28E</gtr:id><gtr:title>TGF?: a sleeping giant awoken by integrins.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trends in biochemical sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/13e6ad07fe78dedf23700da86f0c3823"><gtr:id>13e6ad07fe78dedf23700da86f0c3823</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Worthington JJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0968-0004</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A67F7EDD-1AF0-4B18-B9F3-239B73718012"><gtr:id>A67F7EDD-1AF0-4B18-B9F3-239B73718012</gtr:id><gtr:title>Expression of av?8 integrin on dendritic cells regulates Th17 cell development and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of clinical investigation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/56bfcbf8eb7861b66f082a714897e4a2"><gtr:id>56bfcbf8eb7861b66f082a714897e4a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Melton AC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9738</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FB827516-EE50-4273-AEF3-E4CF578168E3"><gtr:id>FB827516-EE50-4273-AEF3-E4CF578168E3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Intestinal dendritic cells specialize to activate transforming growth factor-? and induce Foxp3+ regulatory T cells via integrin av?8.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Gastroenterology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/13e6ad07fe78dedf23700da86f0c3823"><gtr:id>13e6ad07fe78dedf23700da86f0c3823</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Worthington JJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0016-5085</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8AEC1A7D-1D9F-4B7B-9106-9CE626008095"><gtr:id>8AEC1A7D-1D9F-4B7B-9106-9CE626008095</gtr:id><gtr:title>IRF8 Transcription-Factor-Dependent Classical Dendritic Cells Are Essential for Intestinal T Cell Homeostasis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Immunity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f51be2622a4de08e8ee5affea07d6484"><gtr:id>f51be2622a4de08e8ee5affea07d6484</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Luda KM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1074-7613</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/997C3F63-B8E6-492C-A5FB-157F7A933475"><gtr:id>997C3F63-B8E6-492C-A5FB-157F7A933475</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Thymic Epithelial Stem Cell Pool Persists throughout Ontogeny and Is Modulated by TGF-?.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cell reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0746095af5e2316ea2371049a84632fc"><gtr:id>0746095af5e2316ea2371049a84632fc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ucar O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G001103/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
