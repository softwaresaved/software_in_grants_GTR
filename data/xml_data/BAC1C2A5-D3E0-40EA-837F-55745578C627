It is the main constituent of the Earth's crust beneath the oceans. In a wide range of geological settings beneath the oceans, gabbro co-exists with a rock called peridotite that makes up most of the Earth's interior beneath the crust. At high temperatures, peridotite reacts with water in a process called serpentinisation. This reaction happens under certain pressure and temperature conditions and is often incomplete. Geophysical methods involving sound or electromagnetic waves provide a way to determine the nature of rocks beneath the Earth's surface without directly drilling into them, which is very expensive. These methods can be used to estimate the physical properties of rocks, such as density, seismic velocity (compressional, Vp, or shear, Vs) or electrical resistivity. Laboratory measurements on rock samples from the ocean floor have established a linear relationship between seismic velocity of the partially serpentinised peridotite and the degree of serpentinisation, and thus the amount of water chemically bound within the rock. However, it is difficult to distinguish remotely gabbroic rocks from partially serpentinised peridotite because their seismic velocities are similar. 

The International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 357 will sample the southern wall of the Atlantis Massif, a geological structure close to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where gabbro and serpentinised peridotite have been exposed at or close to the seafloor by faulting. Many previous studies have measured in laboratories the seismic properties of these rock types. In this study, we will use a similar approach on the new samples, but to expand our knowledge we will also measure the variation with direction of the electrical resistivity. The electrical resistivity has one of the widest ranges of any common physical property of solids. Therefore its variation with direction is more easily detectable than that of seismic velocities. Any significant difference of electrical resistivity or its variation with direction between partially serpentinised peridotite and gabbro might enable scientists in future to distinguish between these rock types by recording electromagnetic waves that pass through them. Expedition 357 expects also to collect strongly deformed samples along a near-horizontal fault. These samples will allow us to investigate the relationship between the directional variation of electrical resistivity and the direction of motion along the fault. 

The chemical reaction that leads to the formation of serpentinite can also generate methane gas, and this gas can ultimately provide a food supply for microbes that live on the seafloor. Therefore the flow rates water and methane in these conditions are of significant interest. Flow rates are controlled by a property of the rock called permeability, which measures how easily fluids can pass through it. Therefore the permeability is a valuable additional parameter to measure, but the measurement is very difficult. If Expedition 357 recovers suitable samples, we will measure directly their permeability and explore the relationship between directional variations in permeability and directional variations in electrical resistivity. Establishment of such a relationship would be very valuable because it would allow us to use geophysical data to tell us something about permeability deep in the Earth, in regions that cannot be sampled directly.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>a. Who could potentially benefit from the proposed research over different timescales? 

Identified user groups for the new knowledge that we will create:

(1) Members of the public interested in the physical and natural sciences, Earth history

(2) Deep-sea exploration and exploitation compares 

b. How might the potential beneficiaries benefit?

(1) The public: The ocean and what lies beneath it determine the history of our planet. The continents are what humans consider as home. The public have a broad interest in questions such as: What is the difference between land and ocean? What are the processes that form the oceans and the continents? Where are the boundaries of the continents? Within our project, we aim to obtain scientific knowledge about the physics of two types of rocks: gabbro, which is the main constituent of the oceanic lower crust, and serpentinite that is formed by the hydration of the upper-mantle rocks and is widespread on the ocean floor. The public will benefit from the excitement associated with recovering these rocks from the floor of the deep ocean and understanding more of their properties.

(2) Deep-sea exploration and exploitation companies: In the search for greener energy the European Commission has given priority to the investigation of strategic mineral resources in European territories, including the seabed (Horizon2020). These mineral resources are commonly hosted by oceanic crustal rocks. Geophysical results from our laboratory scale experimental studies will be directly transferable to larger scale remote detection experiments, and will contribute to the development new techniques for sub-seafloor mineral detection.

Our objectives were to gain new knowledge about the physical properties of these rocks usually located deep in the Earth, and find a physical property that would allow to distinguish between them using remote geophysical methods. The rock samples that we used for this study were acquired from depths between 0 and 250 m, during the IODP expeditions 304-305 and 357. When tectonic forces bring these rocks to the near surface, the olivine minerals that they contain may be altered by water. This reaction, called serpentinisation, modifies the physical properties of both, the lower-crustal and the upper-mantle rocks. The upper-mantle rocks contain more olivine than the lower-crustal rocks and thus will be more affected by serpentinisation. At some degree of serpentinisation, the physical properties of both types of rocks will overlap, making it difficult to distinguish them by remote geophysical methods. With our systematic analysis of physical properties, we found that the electrical resistivity can be a useful property to distinguish between these rocks. 

We found that for the two types of rocks there are distinct differences in both, the densities and the wave velocities at shallow subsurface conditions (down to ~ 2 km). Our samples exhibit high porosities. It is known that in addition to the degree of serpentinisation, the porosity contributes in the variations of physical properties. When we compare our density and wave-velocity measurements with those of similar rocks acquired near mid-ocean ridges, we observe an overlap between the properties of lower-crustal and upper-mantle rocks, confirming the difficulty of distinguishing between these types of rocks remotely. The electrical resistivity is a measure of how well an electrical current can propagate within the rocks. Usually the rock matrix resistivity's are infinitely high with respect to the seawater resistivity and thus, the observed electrical resistivity of rocks is a measure of how well the pores within the rocks are connected (electrolytic conduction) and how many electrical charges are available at the surface of the pores (surface conduction). Our lower-crustal rock samples show resistivities between 60 and 221 ohm m whereas the electrical resistivity of altered upper-mantle rocks is lower, and vary between 8 and 44 ohm m. This result is in agreement with the results of previous electromagnetic survey carried out at a similar tectonic environment, where lower-crustal rocks have been shown to exhibit higher resistivity as a result of their lower porosity than the altered upper-mantle rocks. 

The tectonic or magmatic processes that bought the lower-crustal and upper-mantle rocks to their actual location may modify the shapes of the pores within these rocks and their connectivity. Therefore, the electrical resistivity of rocks may be anisotropic, which means the electrical resistivity may vary with direction. Our measurements show an electrical resistivity anisotropy within our rock samples. Both, lower-crustal and upper-mantle rocks exhibit one high and two low and similar electrical resistivity axes, that is the indication of a structure arranged in layers (laminar structure). The directions of high resistivity axes of upper-mantle rock samples are systematically perpendicular to the equivalent axes in lower-crustal rock samples. Core samples used in this study have not been oriented; hence, assuming that the holes were drilled vertically, we can only identify the vertical direction within our rock samples. Although this aspect limits us to make a full comparison between the observed electrical anisotropy and the proposed mechanism for the emplacement of these rocks to their actual locations, our results show that the anisotropy of the electrical resistivity can be used as a tool to distinguish between these rocks, thanks to the differences of their emplacement histories. 

In the absence of a large surface conductivity component, the electrical resistivity is principally a measure of the connected porosity (Archie's law, 1941) and thus might be used as a proxy for the permeability of the rocks. We compared our direct measurements of permeability and electrical resistivity. Electrical resistivity is correlated with the permeability for all samples except for one upper-mantle sample (a dunite) that contains a higher amount of olivine and therefore, is more subjected to serpentinisation. A possible explanation for the mismatch observed for this rock could be that this rock had high amounts of iron before the alteration that produce magnetite during serpentinisation. Small amounts of connected magnetite could bring a surface conductivity component that would lower the electrical resistivity. Our results show that in the absence of such surface conductivity component, the electrical resistivity can be used to estimate the permeability. 

Our study of the physical properties of lower-crustal and upper-mantle rocks in sample size show that the electrical resistivity anisotropy can be used to distinguish between these rocks, and that the electrical resistivity can be used as a proxy for the permeability in case of negligible surface conduction component. We therefore suggest that regional scale controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveys can allow distinguishing between lower-crustal and upper-mantle rocks remotely, especially when they are used in combination with seismic methods that provide additional insight about the emplacement history of these rocks. CSEM surveys might also allow to estimate the permeability, in rocks where no surface conduction is expected.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have showed in sample scale, that the anisotropy of the electrical resistivity can be used to distinguish between lower-crustal and upper-mantle rocks, and in some cases, it can be used as a proxy for the permeability. Our results can now be taken up by geophysicists specializing in controlled source electromagnetic surveys, to confirm that the anisotropy of electrical resistivity can be used to distinguish between these rocks in a larger scale, by remote controlled source electromagnetic surveys. 

Distinguishing between lower-crustal and upper-mantle rocks by remote geophysical methods will help researchers who work on geodynamics, tectonics and seismology to gain new knowledge in tectonic processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges, ocean-continent transition zones, rifted convergent margins and convergent plate boundaries. 

Our physical property datasets that are available on PANGAEA will be useful for other scientists who want to compare regional or petrological variabilities in these properties. 

Serpentinisation reaction produces hydrocarbons that sustain diverse biologic activity. The physical properties of serpentinised rocks such as the porosity and the permeability are relevant for the microbiologists for the characterisation and quantification of such eco-systems. 

Serpentinite hosted hydrothermal circulation has been suggested to play a role in carbon dioxide sequestration trough carbonate precipitation. The remote estimation of permeability of serpentinised rocks might have environmental, economic and energetic impact by contributing in the development of coast-effective carbon capture and storage sites.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>22206EB9-E1F4-4B00-BF88-DC57B2044875</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/research/projects/physical-properties-of-oceanic-mantle-rocks.page</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N012402/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9C0F9DC0-329C-4C09-B439-E4335EA8F916</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Properties Of Earth Materials</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>401A9A9F-83DF-48FD-B108-C4CC7FB7572C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tectonic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>052183D5-AB83-4C5E-97FA-7B0C1D4AF3FA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Volcanic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
