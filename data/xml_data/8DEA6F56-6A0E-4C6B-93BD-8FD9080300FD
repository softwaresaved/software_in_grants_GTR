It takes the form of a documentary video-film supported by a website with background material, and is designed for both academic and aficionado audiences. \n The book is Little Golden America, by the Russian satirists Ilf &amp;amp; Petrov, which is nowadays read in schools and colleges in the USA because it recounts a road trip across the country from New York to California and back. Their guide and interpreter on the trip, Mr Adams, is described as an engineer who had spent several years in the Soviet Union. The historical person on whom this character is based is Solomon Trone (1872-1969), Managing Director of General Electric Russia before the 1917 Revolution and then a leading figure in the electrification of the USSR / a name unrecorded in the history books whose biography, as the film discovers, was nonetheless intertwined with history. Indeed his life traversed major developments in Russia, Japan, Germany, China, India, and Israel. In 1918 he was in Siberia, dodging back and forth between the battling reds and whites. In 1932, he sat in the press gallery at the first of Stalin's show trials. In 1939 he helped arrange for the last boat of Jewish refugees to escape from Germany. In 1945 he attended the Potsdam Conference as a member of the Allied Reparations Committee. But the title of the film will reveal itself as ironic, since Trone was actually born in a small town in Latvia.\n The film explores the vivid contrast between public imagery and private memory. The public imagery of the events and places are drawn from archives, while the private memories and photos are those of his family. Mediating between these two strands are two more threads. The first is the research of a Canadian university librarian, David Evans, following a trail which began when he discovered, from reading the letters of Ilf &amp;amp; Petrov, that Mr Adams was real. Evans writes that researching Solomon Trone 'is a delight':\n He becomes more and more remarkable as a guide through so much of history that \n we had thought we had known. That so much of history now turns out to be a fiction, \n because of uncovering the life of a man we had previously thought of as fictitious, is \n of course ironic. Contrasting Solomon Trone's life between 1905 and 1953 and the \n known history of this period there are many inconsistencies that suggest a different \n version of events. Some of those differences, if they hold up to scrutiny, do not \n appear to be minor. \n But the result is that Mr Evans is now searching for material in archives in various countries across the globe. \n The final thread is a series of comments from a range of scholars, professionals, archivists etc., which address the wider questions which the film raises about public and private versions of history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16329</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A film about the role of the individual in history, and of history in the individual.

It was the subject of presentations at seminars at universities in the UK including Sussex and Luton.
I have received several private inquiries from scholars in different countries working in the field.
In the process of making the film, I also prepared a subtitled edition of the film 'KShE' (Komsomol Patron of Electrification)' by Esfir Shub, and have given several presentations on it, including:

A film about the gap between family memory and public knowledge of history, interweaving reminiscence with photos, films, documents and memorabilia both public and private in a manner uniquely available to the documentary form, it addresses what Walter Benjamin called 'the enigmatic question of the biographical historicity of the individual as such'. The archive comes in many forms: family photos, documents and memorabilia; a huge amount of archived documentation like the photos, films and documents of the General Electric archives at Schenectady; a major find in a London film archive--Esfir Shub's K.Sh.E. (???, or Komsomol Patron of Electrification, 1932). Mediating between reminiscence and archive are two more threads: the research of a university archivist, and a series of comments from historians who address the wider questions which the film raises about public and private versions of history. While these are all familiar elements of documentary film language, the subject of the film is thus seen simultaneously in different perspectives -- father, friend, family elder, and the real person behind a fictional character in a Soviet documentary novel of the 1930s. However, seeking to locate the biographical subject in historical space, the film is forced to negotiate the recalcitrance of the archival image, the elusiveness of the immediate context that always lies off-camera, outside the frame. Approaching the problem by making the process of investigation part of the story, the film tests the capacity of the documentary form to make sense of this diversity of evidence by foregrounding uncertainties, ambiguities, unanswered questions, instead of presenting a neat and rounded narrative. Nonetheless the effect of telling this story of an individual life is much more than the celebration of an extraordinary career, but to decentre our sense of twentieth century history, to recover a lost perspective, because this is not the history that we think we know, but another history, lived in another way.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Feedback from early screenings indicated that the film could have an appeal across several areas. Considered in terms of research-as-practice it contributes to documentary and archive film studies as a solution to the problematic of historical representation. But it also holds interest in fields such as twentieth century history, politics, geography, industrial development, and postcolonial studies. The film has been made available on DVD for purchase or streaming through an independent web distributor, and is supported by an informative website.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5D35F421-9E62-4A51-96D6-048548E49117</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.americanwhoelectrifiedrussia.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C2639084-B275-414E-84DF-747BBBF1FBB4"><gtr:id>C2639084-B275-414E-84DF-747BBBF1FBB4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Cinema of Me, The Self and Subjectivity in First Person Documentary</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3720fd4baafd1be4096645cd58cded6a"><gtr:id>3720fd4baafd1be4096645cd58cded6a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Michael Chanan (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-231-16214-2</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F015623/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
