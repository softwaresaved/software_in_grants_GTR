A variety of novel hip preserving surgical techniques are now utilised worldwide. These surgeries are now viewed as desirable alternatives compared with persistent hip pain, joint degeneration and hip replacement in a young population. However this is still an underserved patient group where the full social, economic and QoL impact of living with these conditions over the life course has not been explored. We know treatment and care are not always optimal, referral to specialised care can be slow and there is limited research available comparing outcomes for different treatments (Nunley et al 2011). 
This is an emerging research area and a focus of current work of the applicants (TG, AFL, JH, RK). Our core group now includes ST and EE. We aim to develop a research agenda and research network that continues beyond the seminar series, bringing together researchers from diverse academic and clinical backgrounds and countries. We have begun to generate a wider group of multi-disciplinary academics, patients and clinicians to create an international research network. JH has international links with the invited speakers, Michael Millis and Prof Ganz, TG has links with the Nicola Rumsey specialising in body image , we will also draw on the expertise of others working in similar fields David Flynn (QoL scoliosis), and AFL with Profs Sugden and Christensen (education). In addition we build on our existing strong patient link for speakers.
The seminar series aims to facilitate engagement between academic researchers, clinicians and persons with a PHC to discuss and debate issues concerning diagnosis, treatment decision-making and post-surgical care and to develop a research agenda to promote evidence-based practice and measurement of what matters to persons with a PHC and their family. It has six specific objectives;
1.Develop a fuller understanding of the QoL impact of PHCs across the life-course, centred on the experiences and perspectives of persons with these conditions and their significant others. 
2.Enable clinicians and academics currently engaged in the care or research surrounding PHC to share perspectives and ideas with persons with these conditions and learn from research in other paediatric conditions with long-lasting impact,
3.Develop ways to raise awareness of the patient and family perspective across the treatment and caring professions
4.Share and exchange multi-disciplinary knowledge around the treatment and care of PHCs both within and between parts of the UK, European and the USA
5.Explore economic-related, educational and body image dimensions of living with a PHC condition over time
6.Develop supportive strategies to embed successfully the assessment of patient concerns and impact of the conditions into routine clinical practice across the life-course.
Six, one-day interactive seminars, with informative pre-circulated presentations, will be undertaken, concluding with action points: 
i.Uncovering the Expert Patient/Lay and Familial Perspective
ii.Measuring the Concerns, Consequences and QoL Impact of PHC: 
iii.International Healthcare Diagnosis and Treatment Approaches: Clinical Perspectives: Monitoring and Assessing Outcomes of PHC within Routine Practice
iv.Childhood and Young Persons Impact on Schooling and Social Participation
v.Communicating, Awareness and Support for Persons with PHC

A key benefit will be development of an inter-disciplinary research agenda in this emerging field which moves beyond the surgical and clinical perspective to embrace the person with a PHC and their family. A dialogue during and after the seminar series will be supported by a website providing seminar papers, discussion forums and links to proposed research. We will link this to existing hip, charitable and patient forums. The creation of a strong research network and action plans ensures its sustainability and future collaboration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The seminar series brings together academics (health sciences, health services research, health economics and education), persons with a PHC and informal carers and clinicians (GP, specialist hip surgeons, rehabilitation team members) to develop a collaborative inter-disciplinary research agenda. The explicit intention is to enable a shift from a multi- to an inter-disciplinary approach, with a strong patient dimension. A core set of participants will be invited to attend all the seminars; additional persons will be invited to individual seminars (medical students for Seminars 3 &amp;amp; 4; persons from education and disability to Seminar 5). 

The first two seminars (1, 2) focus on sharing expert patient/lay and familial perspectives (1) of health and well-being concerns, consequences and QoL impact surrounding living with a PHC across the life-course, and economic-related dimensions and ways these can be explored (2). (3) explores clinical practice in different countries with a view to share best practice. (4) builds on this with a focus on outcomes monitoring and its implementation in practice and the potential for information sharing across healthcare agencies. (5) focuses on the impact of PHCs on childhood and young persons. (6) addresses the key area of communicating, awareness-raising and support for persons with a PHC.

Potential beneficiaries include:
- Patients and family members/informal carers 
- Practitioners: NHS and private, across levels (GP, general and specialist hip surgeons, hip rehabilitation team) and teachers
- Academic researchers: clinical effectiveness researchers; trialists; health and social science, economics and educational researchers in the UK and beyond
- Policy makers: NHICE, clinical commissioning groups from future research studies

The work will contribute to the nation's health, wealth and culture by:
- Addressing an ESRC strategic challenge, health and well-being, for PHCs across the life-course, the consequences of ill-health on social and economic participation and developing models of good practice, providing a foundation for enhanced evidence-based practice and clinical outcomes studies 
- Development of an inter-disciplinary research agenda promoting early diagnosis, prevention of early disability and patient-centred assessment tools of the health and well-being and QoL impact of PHC. 
- Developing a cross-Universities, sectors and patient collaborative, inter-disciplinary research thematic network to be involved in research bids and advising on emerging research and practice implications. 
- Providing a platform for collaborative international EU Horizon 2020 research bids, addressed at the core societal challenge of developing and preserving good health, centred on issues of importance to patients
- Enhancing insight into health and well-being, economic-related and QoL impact areas from the patient perspective to enable development of patient-focused assessment tools
- Promoting ongoing monitoring and assessment in hip clinical practice of impact on patients across service levels and in evaluation studies, contributing to the development of models of good treatment and care practice.
- Identifying potential supportive curative and preventive self-care strategies and support for treatment decision making, tailored to patient concerns. Disseminating to: i clinicians - via GP and specialist interest groups, European Hip Society and International Dysplasia Institute websites and professional journals; ii medical, physio- and occupational therapy post-graduate/registration educationists for CPD courses; iii academic community, via peer-reviewed publications in health, social science and medical journals; iv patients - via project website, links on web-based patient forums and patient information leaflets (via GPs, charities and clinical teams); v social media utilising existing social network sites. All supported by development and maintenance of a project web-site.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18138</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ESRC Seminar 5</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7D53B33-196C-4DBD-A06D-17BB145D9035</gtr:id><gtr:impact>v.
