change</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M006263/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The winter storms of 2013-2014 set new precedents of coastal damage in the UK, forcing government, heritage bodies and local communities to seriously reconsider the future management of coastal heritage. Relevant organisations were seemingly unprepared for these events, and communities were possibly surprised by what had happened, as well as by their own emotional response. Over 8200 miles away, in the low-lying island nation of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, over 100,000 citizens face the possibility of permanent relocation due to climate change and sea-level rise which threaten homeland and heritage. Troubling in itself, Kiribati also presents an unsettling visualisation of a collective future. These diverse settings are brought together in this project through the exploration of current and potential loss of heritage in times of accelerated climate change.

In the UK our project partners, the National Trust, own 742 miles of coastline and face difficult negotiations regarding their Coastal Adaptation Strategy. This research will consider the challenges facing heritage organisations and communities by focusing on three case studies; two of these are National Trust sites: Porthdinllaen (in North Wales) and Durgan Village (in Cornwall), with these two villages at risk respectively of increased tidal flooding and coastal erosion. The third case study in Kiribati considers a more urgent situation, exploring the societal and personal effect of potential whole-scale loss on perceptions of heritage, sense of place, religious beliefs and cultural identity. At each distinct site we will explore community, heritage and government responses to current challenges, as well as strategies for a stormy future. The data collected will be archived with project partners National Library of Wales and Cornish Audio Visual Archive, providing a legacy for this research and the communities under threat. More immediately, we hope to inform improved communication and consultation processes for these and comparative communities in future.

Whereas popular imaginings of 'heritage' are likely to include buildings or assets with acknowledged historic value, there is an increased awareness among heritage organisations and administrations such as the Welsh Government that the more 'ordinary' or 'everyday' can also be valuable to communities, embedded in local history and the texture of lived lives. Broader definitions of heritage could include a bus shelter, coastal path, or even a particular tree, because they have meaning to the people who experience them. In order to deepen our understanding of 'sense of place', we will use a multi-layered interpretation of heritage as a concept and a process relating both to the tangible as well as the intangible (values, beliefs, practices). This strategy is essential to fully appreciate the subtle and traumatic ways in which climate-change disrupts community lives and identities, with potentially painful transitions ahead.

This interdisciplinary project invites collaboration with the Australian poet Mark Tredinnick, who will visit Kiribati and offer a poetic response to the effects of climate change on 'place' in more abstract terms. This research claims a greater stake for arts and humanities disciplines in climate adaptation debates, mostly dominated by natural and social scientists, and we will adopt an innovative approach towards engagement in and dissemination of our research. There will be poetry, films, conversation and community stories as well as scholarly and qualitative analysis. Artistic responses will be useful in connecting and articulating perceptions of the past and imaginings of the future at these sites, and in a broader cultural context. Our edited films, freely available to relevant organisations, may serve to amplify and bridge multiple voices, forging local and international cross-cultural understanding of the effect of climate change on heritage, communities and sense of place.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our research will develop deeper understandings and framings of heritage loss at a local level and international level, investigate how the impacts of climate change disrupt this heritage, and seek strategies for improved communication and consultation around these issues. This work will benefit communities at a grassroots level through direct engagement, as well as comparative communities in future. We will create multi-media resources and make them freely available to pro-actively targeted organisations, share our findings through our website, and promote the research through social media. This is a conscious effort to inhabit local, national and transnational public spheres, with collective benefits from enhanced dialogue and 'good information'.

1. Policy-makers and government: We will engage relevant government/policy makers (national, regional and community levels) through interviews, and shared findings. In Wales, the Welsh Government is currently holding a 'national conversation' about climate-change, are interested in 'sense of place' work and site public communication as a key priority with flooding and coastal adaptation. The WG is loosely connected to the project through these collaborators: (i) Sustainable Wales (who have agreed to host videos), (ii) Climate Outreach Information Network (lead advisors for the Welsh Government on sustainable development narratives), and (iii) Prof. Mike Philips, professor of coastal geomorphology (project advisor, active in policy circles). In Kiribati we have access to policy makers through the involvement of Claire Anterea Kaitaake (Kiribati Adaptation Project), and through the advice of Riibeta Abeta, former Senior Environment Officer (Kiribati Government). Our multi-media resources would be made freely available to the Kiribati Government for local and international advocacy and informational purposes. 

2. International organisations: We are in dialogue with: Climate Outreach Information Network (our collaborators) and Pacific Calling Partnership, and seek to develop connections with: Pacific Island Development Programme, Pacific Water Institute, United Nations Environment Programme, Union of Concerned Scientists

3. Third Sector: The National Trust (partners) are integrated into our research in several ways: attending out symposia (beginning and end of project); grass-roots involvement in the UK case studies; interviewed as part of our contextual overview on heritage organisations and climate change. They will share and disseminate findings through their organisation and networks. With our partners, the National Library of Wales and the Cornish Audio Visual Archive, we will co-develop methodologies for archiving the contemporary life that we encounter in our case studies. This will have long-term impact for NLW and CAVA, future researchers, and the documented communities. With a strong religious aspect to our research in Kiribati, we would target: Christian Aid, World Council of Churches, Forum on Religion and Ecology (FORE).

4. Creative Collaborations: We have two direct non-HEI collaborations to create artistic work which can reach a broad international audience (i) Australian poet Mark Tredinnick will visit Kiribati, to write about 'place' in times of accelerated climate change; (ii) The PI will collaborate with Kiribati locals and sound-recordist Richard Gott to create short online films. Arts output will be publicised and disseminated by project collaborators: Cape Farewell and Welsh Literature Exchange, and will interest: New Welsh Review, Planet Magazine, Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment (ASLE), Centre for Contemporary Art and the Natural World (CCANW), RANE (Research in Art and Nature), and various literary publications.

5. The media: We would contact Guardian online, Australia Network News online, OneClimate, The Kiribati Independent etc and local media at case-study sites (radio, newspapers, community newsletters.)</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>44679</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This shorted, subtitled version of the longer 'Troubled Waters' film was created at the request of the National Trust and the International National Trust Organisation.

The sound recording was by the project's creative collaborator, Richard Gott. The film specifically addresses the ways in which climate change affects heritage in the low-lying island nation of Kiribati. It does this by bringing together diverse perspectives through a sequence of interview clips with the President, cultural officer, community members, activists, and scholars in Kiribati. These are layered with a visual representation of the landscape and culture. 'Troubled Waters' may begin to redefine the very concept of heritage, which is presented as inextricably connected to land and the natural environment in Kiribati.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A31EE1FA-AE3F-428B-AF67-76343C7D4356</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film has been shown in its entirety, or as a series of clips in several public events and academic conferences, detailed separately. It is hard to prove a change in public perception (which is an overt aim of the project), but audiences have reported that they had not previously considered climate change as affecting culture (or fully acknowledged how culture frames the experience of climate change). The film has certainly fed into contemporary debate, and has been referred to, and engaged with by practitioners and academics in an international sphere of climate activism, and heritage conservation (e.g: Edmund Rice Centre Australia, Climate Outreach Information Network, Newport Restoration Foundation). I was asked to do a radio interview as a result of a film screening (BBC Radio Cymru), and consulted about a forthcoming Welsh-language documentary series on climate change (by Tinopolis, for S4C, forthcoming in 2016). The film has also promoted creative practice as a research methodology, achieving recognition in the AHRC Research in Film Awards, with a short clip screened at the British Film Institute.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Troubled Waters- Film</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/130445697</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This 30-minute film combines techniques from the film essay, activist environmental video and documentary tradition to explore the relationship between cultural identity, attachment to place and climate change.

TIMELINE was also published/embedded online on Screenworks (February 2017), and shortlisted for a British Association of Film, Television and Screen Studies award: 'Best Practice Research' (2017). It was described by one peer reviewer as having 'considerable potential for public engagement and impact as a piece of practice research / activism'. The film has screened at the following public events as part of the 'Being Human' festival (supported by the AHRC): Burdall's Yard, Bath Spa. November 19th, 2016; Aberystwyth Arts Centre, November 25th, 2016; Borth, The Friendship Inn, November 25th, 2016. It was also screened at a 'Past Matters, Research Futures' academic conference, on 12/13 December 2016 at the Royal Society, showcasing research under the AHRC's 'Care for the Future' theme. TIMELINE was also featured in the Times Higher Education Magazine, and embedded on its website. This was part of a larger debate about the use of film in research. It was also embedded on 'The Conversation' online, under the heading 'five award-winning short films made by researchers that you should watch'. TIMELINE was also embedded on the blog 'Climate Crocs', by foremost climate blogger in the USA, Peter Sinclair, and described as a 'masterclass in visual storytelling'.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>TIMELINE (30 min film)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/172669824</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Welsh National College (Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Coleg Cymraeg (Welsh College)</gtr:description><gtr:id>0C301835-A565-42C1-AA8D-AB1BFE419A65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One major project output, the multidisciplinary film 'Troubled Waters' was partially enabled through the College's financial contribution.

Academics reported that they had a far better idea of the challenges facing the National Trust regarding coastal erosion in the UK, and public communication. It was an opportunity to make more detailed plans with the National Trust for collaborative working in Potrthdinllaen (North Wales), where arts-based methods might be used and tested. There was also discussion of how the NT might be able to travel to Kiribati for knowledge-exchange. COIN agreed to participate in a filmed interview with Sara Penrhyn Jones.

The even was packed, to the extent that more people came than could physically fit into the space. Both films featured local people, including members of the public and/or artists that had participated in their creation in some way. There was also music by the band Whistler. There were vocal and public expression of enthusiasm towards the films, and very lively and spontaneous conversations for the whole evening on what it meant to live in Borth (so vulnerable to the sea, yet also thriving in many ways). There was feedback that the films naturally touched on huge and often-depressing global challenges, but that the effect overall was a celebration of place and community.

Each talk and presentation related to the idea of drowning in art. The audience reported that they had not previously connected the drowning of Welsh villages (like Tryweryn) in the 50s and 60s to the current and projected 'drowning' of low-lying nations because of climate change. There was a powerful realisation for the audience and speaker that the question of how to treat the dead (buried in the ground) during such drownings was one of the most emotive issues, especially for smaller and indigenous cultures.

However, this project has attracted successful follow-on funding to achieve specific impact objectives, based on project findings. These are many, concrete outputs, co-delivered with partners and collaborators, and documented seperately).

This project has benefited our partners from the third sector in many ways: The National Trust has gained a more in-depth portrayal of coastal challenges at two of its climate-vulnerable villages, which also offers insights applicable to other comparative sites. The project findings will appear in the Trust's internal magazine in May 2017, so that they can be accessed by all its employees. The local communities at such sites should also benefit from enhanced awareness and understanding of the issues involved, and that threaten their own wellbeing. The National Library of Wales and the Cornish Audio Visual Archive have benefited from an opportunity to share knowledge. This has included hosting and attending project symposia, including an expert on 'future-proofing' the archive. This may in turn have fed into organisational thinking and practice around the idea of curating archives for climate-vulnerable sites. Our partners the National College of Wales strives to promote academic research and teaching through the medium of Welsh, and the project PI has delivered two public talks, and a radio discussion on the research in Welsh. We have been able to respond directly to the need amongst heritage professionals for advice on how to effectively communicate climate change, by gaining follow-on funding to create a climate change communication toolkit, with and for heritage organisations. We will continue to work with heritage organisations, and in particular with Manchester Museum, to achieve this. 

This project's focus has evolved naturally into a more international domain, due to growing interest. Although initial contacts in Kiribati were quite limited, these have expanded into far more involved and co-designed efforts to address Kiribati's challenges in future (with follow-on funding in place to realise this ambition). The 'Troubled Waters' project was vindicated in its original ambitions when one of the founders of KiriCAN (a local, grassroots environmental organisation) told us on camera: 'we are worried that no one in the world will hear out stories'. Some of these stories have been successfully amplified through the production of a film: 'Troubled Waters', which explores climate change through a local, cultural lens in Kiribati. Our original partnership with the National Trust has grown to also involve the International National Trusts Organization. It is through INTO that we were able to screen a part of 'Troubled Waters' at several events in the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech (2017). We have also been invited to present the film at the Museum of World Culture in Sweden, which will help to highlight the particular environmental challenges that Kiribati faces, from a culturally-attuned perspective. The project has demonstrated the value of research through film: not only does it offer a particularly useful way of 'listening', but it is also harnessing creativity in order to educate and raise awareness internationally, and to create new knowledge networks. This may help to argue for the importance of 'creativity' (and the arts and humanities more generally) in solving some of our greatest global challenges.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D2A94154-E590-4DC7-BA75-A48925414303</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) By engaging with specific local communities in Porthdinllaen (Wales), and Durgan (Cornwall), it was possible to gain a sense of community awareness of environmental change in two distinct locations. In general, local communities seemed very aware of visible environmental and coastal change, and were already dealing with issues such as coastal erosion, land slips, and flooding. However, there was less certainty about the future implications of climate change. Some of this was due to lack of specific local climate projections, the necessarily imprecise nature of scientific modeling, and- in some cases- the perception that there was no scientific consensus that climate change was 'definitely happening'. Some residents or long-term tenants also expressed the idea that climate change was a worry for the future, and not something that felt pressing at the moment. In both Durgan and Porthdinllaen, it was clear that there was very strong attachment to the coast, and that this was not only felt by permanent residents, but also by visitors. Some long-term lease holders of the NT cottages in NT had been visiting Porthdinllaen for three generations. Clear communication on climate change is obviously needed from the National Trust, but this is not something that happens in a cultural vacuum, and may be very challenging to convey the idea that coastal adaptation is needed now. It is often hard to 'compete' with the need to manage issues which may feel more pressing for residents at the moment (such as visitor access, and parking). There was a belief at the local and national level of the National Trust, that arts-based community engagement ould potentially be one of the best ways to instigate necessary awareness and conversations.

2) Some heritage organisations in the UK are very involved in initiatives to promote public awareness of climate change, such as Manchester Museum. Other heritage organizations may have different stances within their organisations, with some individuals within them trying to catalase change and a more overt strategy. We found an appetite amongst heritage professionals for opportunities to share experiences and ideas about how the heritage sector could responsibly and constructively respond to the challenge of climate change. There was a feeling that heritage is hampered by the perception that it is all about 'keeping things the same', rather than managing change (or even affecting the future). 

3) The original ambition was to depict the challenges of projected displacement in Kiribati, due to rising seas, through a creative film. By conducting a series of interviews with cultural heritage experts and artists, other highly important themes were brought to light. These included the very particular meanings of heritage in Kiribati (which included the natural environment, such as the two main trees), the culturally-specific idea of ancestral land, the 'fine line' between the dead and the living, and some resistance to the notion that Kiribati may be defined as 'poor'. Seen through this more local lens, the potential trauma of displacement seemed even greater. We also discovered the need to address current development challenges today (such as the lack of clean or safe drinking water, sanitation, and waste on the island), and understood how focusing too much on the future may be disempowering to the i-kiribati, and effectively 'write-off' the present challenges, which could be proactively addressed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main project output, the film 'Troubled Waters', has been used/screened by many project partners, as well as being extremely useful in making new connections for ongoing research and impact. The idea that the story of climate change and cultural heritage needs to be told in more compelling ways, is one that is shared by organisations such as the International National Trusts Organization and UCOMOS. The film continues to put across such messages by organisations such as these, at venues such as the UN COP (Marrakech), various websites, heritage conferences and university courses, and so on. Our main findings will also appear in the next issue of the National Trust's internal magazine ('Views') to ensure that insights can feed back more widely to our partner organisation. We have used other artistic methods (such as artistic street projection) to reach diverse audiences. The original three early-career investigators are all still involved in follow-on research and impact activities which utilise a range of strategies for acting upon or feeding back the most significant findings of the project- either to a general or target audience.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>35F0FF00-4240-4012-A343-4A662D6CD483</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.corddirdyfroedd.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C1A7D8BA-B9F7-4585-9443-D713AA8E123C"><gtr:id>C1A7D8BA-B9F7-4585-9443-D713AA8E123C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Troubled Waters; Representing Kiribati, a 'sinking nation', through Artistic Production</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66"><gtr:id>6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2EA4D880-728E-4606-9C04-70B6892088B1"><gtr:id>2EA4D880-728E-4606-9C04-70B6892088B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Troubled Waters, Stormy Futures: heritage in times of accelerated climate change&amp;quot;</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/36ffe75ccb6024196f030bfb52e0bbd1"><gtr:id>36ffe75ccb6024196f030bfb52e0bbd1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woodham A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/322D9363-8966-48A3-A1D9-6785148C9F73"><gtr:id>322D9363-8966-48A3-A1D9-6785148C9F73</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;The role of co-production in addressing difficult pasts and futures: beyond the museum&amp;quot;</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/61fbc8720ebcbeeca38ffca4bc9b0506"><gtr:id>61fbc8720ebcbeeca38ffca4bc9b0506</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Onciul B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/85C98B0D-5474-4BF7-85BE-995B477EAD46"><gtr:id>85C98B0D-5474-4BF7-85BE-995B477EAD46</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Troubled Waters: The role of practice-led research in understanding and documenting heritage loss&amp;quot;</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66"><gtr:id>6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A51C0204-4942-406A-9180-683929622A9B"><gtr:id>A51C0204-4942-406A-9180-683929622A9B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Preseli Hills Transcended: oral history as utopian method</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/94779757c4a480dcd997eee981a0ea7d"><gtr:id>94779757c4a480dcd997eee981a0ea7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Knutson, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M006263/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>31A10E51-A33E-43A5-80D7-B466E37C21DD</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/M006263/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>44679.02</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>AFF28DCD-1A03-4C32-89DE-22563BED5126</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/M006263/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>13347.02</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
