Typical patients are those who are unable to afford health insurance, are unemployed or self-employed, are older than 64 years, or have a chronic disease (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, cancer). To provide these services, the MoPH contacts with 135 public and private hospitals. 

Since 2001 the reimbursement rate paid to hospitals by the ministry was determined by the results of a hospital accreditation process. However, over the past several years evidence has accumulated that this was not an effective way to manage the relationship between the MoPH and hospitals. Importantly, the ministry has imperfect information on the performance of hospitals. In 2014 the MoPH began a transition away from the accreditation-only contracting system, and towards one based on performance, including patient outcomes.

The main purpose of this research is to develop a performance-based contracting (PBC) system between the MoPH and hospitals in Lebanon, and evaluate its impact on patients and the health system. Such contracting means that the ministry would reward hospitals that perform better by paying them a higher base rate per patient. We will investigate what factors may affect hospital performance and how hospitals responded to this intervention.

There has been much work on PBC in health services over the past two decades. However the evidence to support its benefit to patients and cost-effectiveness presents mixed results. One of the main reasons for this is the limited number of strongly designed studies. Recent evidence from England and the United States has also found that positive effects such as reduced readmissions and mortality may be limited to the short-term, and underlined the importance of PBC measurement, context and design. In low/middle-income countries (LMIC) evidence is still more limited, though PBC holds much promise as it may have larger impact on health outcomes given the potential to improve. However this also means it may have larger unintended or negative consequences, and should be designed with great care and close monitoring of impact.

In designing PBC, it is important to determine how performance will be measured and how we would evaluate its impact. In our research, at the patient level we will look at changes in patient readmissions for specific conditions, which could indicate inadequate treatment, hospital-acquired infections, or other causes. We will also look at the proportion of patients admitted to each hospital in terms of their age and presence of chronic diseases, as some hospitals may 'cherry-pick' and avoid patients with more complex conditions. We will also develop a patient satisfaction questionnaire, and use it to measure the satisfaction of patients that would be representative of the hospital they were treated at. At the health system/hospital level we will look at the utilization and cost of different services, as well as how complex are the cases being admitted to each hospital (case-mix). We will compare the results for these performance indicators before and after implementation of PBC, and investigate any changes. We will also interview a sample of hospital managers to understand how hospitals responded to PBC and what changes they may have made to affect their performance, such as better application of clinical guidelines, increased training or incentives to the health workforce.

We will actively share our research findings with stakeholders and the public through various channels including developing knowledge translation materials and events such as seminars and policy roundtables. The knowledge gained will be used to inform future PBC development in Lebanon and similar initiatives in LMICs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) contracts with 135 public and private hospitals to provide hospitalization services to 52% of Lebanon's citizens. Since 2001 the MoPH has used a three-tier reimbursement rate for hospitals based on their results in a hospital accreditation process. Evidence has accumulated over the past several years that this contracting mechanism was not appropriate, and the MoPH has turned to performance-based contracting (PBC) to address its lack of information on services provided (classical principal-agent problem). 

The research team will develop a PBC intervention between the MoPH and hospitals, and evaluate its impact at patient and health system/hospital levels. Our principle research question is: What factors determine the impact of performance-based hospital contracting to improve patient outcomes, equity and efficiency?

We will use a mixed-methods approach, with qualitative and quantitative components. The MoPH hospitalization database will be used to measure hospital case-mix, service utilization and cost, and 30-day readmissions for specific conditions/procedures. We will design a patient satisfaction questionnaire using focus group discussions, and apply it to measure patient satisfaction across hospitals. With one year of pre-intervention data available the baseline hospital performance will be calculated and used by the MoPH to set new hospital reimbursement rates. With one year of post-intervention data available we will evaluate PBC impact at patient and health system/hospital levels. We will also interview a sample of hospital managers to investigate changes hospitals undertook as a response to PBC (e.g. staff incentives, trainings). 

We will share our findings using stakeholder seminars, policy roundtables, professional networks, policy briefs and other knowledge-translation tools, and use this to use our findings to inform future development of PBC in Lebanon and similar initiatives in low/middle-income countries.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is an implementation-focused initiative, and as such the time-frame for benefits to be realized is within the duration of the project, and will include active engagement relevant to Lebanon and other low/middle-income countries (LMICs).

Who will benefit from this research?
1. Persons covered by the MoPH 
2. Ministry of Public Health
3. LMICs interested in PBC 
4. Public and private hospitals
5. Healthcare professionals 

How will they benefit from this research?
The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) provides hospitalization coverage for all citizens without health insurance. These are typically the unemployed or self-employed, are older than 64 years, or have a chronic disease (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, cancer). These citizens are the most vulnerable in society and would be the first to benefit from improved hospital performance. The performance-based contracting design creates incentives for hospitals to decrease patient readmissions and out-of-pocket payment, and improve patient satisfaction, all of which have direct effect on patients. Additionally, allowing for measures such as case-mix and co-morbidities to interpret performance results will discourage hospitals from avoiding patients with more complex conditions.

The MoPH is also a direct beneficiary of this initiative. Using PBC as a tool to address the current principal-agent problem will allow the ministry to have greater ability to incentivize improved patient outcomes and health system equity and efficiency. This is also of increased importance given the budgetary limitations on healthcare as well as the socioeconomic conditions affected by the refugee influx from the conflict in neighboring Syria. 
An additional benefit of research findings is to inform similar performance-based initiatives that are being considered by the MoPH for its network of primary health centres throughout the country. 

A main purpose of this research is to effectively contribute to very limited evidence available on PBC in health services, in particular for low/middle-income countries. This research will inform on what factors affected PBC impact at patient and health system/hospital levels, and provide some insight into how PBC may be designed to sustainably integrate in the healthcare system and incentivize improved performance in limited settings. We will actively share our findings using knowledge-translation events and tools, with particular emphasis on PBC in LMICs, to benefit policymakers and stakeholders who may be considering similar initiatives in their countries. 

Public and private hospitals contracted with the MoPH will also benefit from this initiative by being reimbursed for hospitalization expenditures based on their performance. The linkage between reimbursement and performance (rather than accreditation) is a considerable improvement which is also supported by hospitals, and would increase mutual trust and transparency between them and the MoPH. It is also important to note that processes by which hospitals improved their performance may provide valuable lessons for uptake by lesser-performing hospitals. 

Healthcare professionals may also be beneficiaries of this initiative, in particular physicians and nurses. Hospitals may have different responses to PBC, such as providing incentives or trainings to personnel or improving working conditions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>389398</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Syndicate of Private Hospitals engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC1F637C-9F31-47BB-81BB-CAF38AEE8C54</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several discussions have been held between the project team and the leadership of the Syndicate of Private Hospitals throughout the past year, including on preliminary results of casemix indices and other indicators.

Utilization review and auditing
We have supported the development of algorithms and programing scripts to analyze 15 diagnoses admitted under MoPH coverage in private and public hospitals that it is contracted with. We have identified 37 hospitals who were outliers in terms of cost or length of stay indicators, and disseminated this information to the MoPH utilization review function and auditing committee for further examination and/or investigation. This has informed the regulation of hospital services, however specific impacts to hospitals have not yet been specified, but will be subsequently available from the MoPH auditing committee (e.g. cases investigated, reimbursement deductions).

2. Identification of limitations in current case coding system
We have examined the structure and approach of coding (using ICD10 and surgical procedure coding) of hospitalization cases, in particular those regarding cases with prostheses. We have identified specific limitations of the current manner of coding such prosthesis cases inside the MoPH hospitalization database, and have discussed this with the MoPH Service of Hospitals, Dispensaries and Medical Professions and the IT Department. Discussions are ongoing on adopting an alternative coding structure for prosthesis cases. 

3. Dialogue with the Syndicate of Private Hospitals on future development of hospital contracting
The MoPH has used the latest results of hospital performance scores and hospital casemix index (2015 data) that have been calculated by the project team, to inform its discussions with the Syndicate regarding developments of the hospitalization system and of future performance-based contracting.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Calculation of hospital performance scores for 2016 contracting round, using 2015 hospitalization data.

A final combination script provides the overall casemix index for each hospital contracted with the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH).

The surgical algorithm includes two optional approaches: one that includes the updated prosthesis codes adopted in 2015, and another that excludes these codes for better comparability with previous years. 

These algorithms have been expressed in STATA programming scripts, and results have been calculated for all hospitals throughout the period between 2011 and 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8565A86F-CE1C-4E27-B551-F1FF3CA3A4E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The initial scripts developed calculated annual casemix index; the results were analyzed and discussed by the research team, based on which we developed the scripts further to calculate casemix index by quarter (20 quarters spanning 2011-2015).

Further work is continuing to develop monthly casemix index and analyze impact of previous policy interventions using interrupted time-series analysis.

Since annual casemix index of a hospital depends on both its own cases as well as that of all other hospitals, the casemix index formula has - by design - both specific and relative components. An absolute component is also present in the form of fixed weights of specific ICD10 codes. We have attempted to dissect the standard formula, to better understand the changes that have happened in medical casemix index throughout 2011-2015. Specifically, we wanted to see how we could isolate changes in casemix index to one particular hospital from changes in all other/population-wide hospitals. This activity was also undertaken in anticipation of future discussions with stakeholders (individual hospitals and the Syndicate of Private Hospitals) regarding the impact of absolute and relative components of the formula on individual hospital results over multiple years.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CCAB036B-847E-476D-B082-20E7EA3E9E32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The casemix index formula should not be dismantled and utilized for practice, from a conceptual perspective. However, it was beneficial to understand which components had the greater impact on hospital casemix index. In this case the numerator results were of limited application value, since comparing across the years without using the population-wide anchor (denominator) of every year means we are in one form comparing apples to oranges.

Therefore the main benefit of this was to understand that it is more important that hospitals be compared to other hospitals in the same year (population anchor), rather than a specific hospital being compared to itself across the years (hospital anchor).

An alternative approach which will be further developed is to compare hospital-specific 3-year casemix index with the same hospital's 1-year casemix index, using the standard formula.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Algorithms and programming scripts for examing trends in the numerator component of the hospital casemix index formula</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have developed the algorithms and programming scrips (in STATA) for the calculation of the following 10 cost and utilization indicators:
