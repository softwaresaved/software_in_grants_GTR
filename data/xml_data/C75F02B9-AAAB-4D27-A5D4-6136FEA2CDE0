Current treatment options for ESRD are dialysis or renal transplantation, which apart from their significant drawbacks in terms of increased morbidity and mortality, are also placing an increasing economic burden on society. ESRD usually develops from a progressive worsening of chronic renal disease. In most cases, however, there is a time-window of several years from the onset of mild/moderate kidney disease to the development of ESRD, which could present an opportunity to design therapies aimed at preventing disease progression by repairing or replacing damaged renal tissue. Over recent years, stem cells have been identified in the kidneys of mice and humans that are able to generate some of the specialised cells that are essential for the kidneys to function. Studies have shown that if these kidney-derived stem cells (KSCs) are injected into mice with kidney disease, they populate the damaged tissue and in some cases, can even improve kidney function. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue have also been shown to ameliorate kidney disease in rodents. However, no studies have directly compared the therapeutic efficacy of these two stem cell types, nor investigated whether they remain in the kidneys and are able to benefit the recipient over the long-term, or if their presence is only short-lived.

There are also a number of safety issues surrounding such therapies that need to be addressed; for instance, the possibility that the stem cells populate other tissues besides the kidney has not been thoroughly investigated. This information is important because if the stem cells end up in the wrong environment, they could generate inappropriate cell types, or could potentially from tumours, which would be detrimental to the recipient.

In this project, we will compare the therapeutic efficacy of human KSCs and MSCs in mice with kidney disease. To check if the stem cells populate tissues other than the kidney, in some experiments, we will label the cells so that they can be monitored non-invasively using various imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, photoacoustic imaging and bioluminescence imaging. We will also follow some animals over the long-term to investigate if they develop tumours.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>1. Determining the efficacy of KSC and MSC therapies in mice with ischaemic reperfusion (IR) and adriamcyin (Adr)-induced kidney injury
We will use MSCs derived from human adipose tissue, as it has been established that such cells have more potent immunomodulatory effects than those derived from bone marrow. Immunodeficient (SCID) BALB/c mice will be used for both models.
Targets to be met: (i) establish the optimal administration route for each injury model (i.e., intravenous (IV), intracardiac via left ventricle (LV) or intraperitoneal (IP)); (ii) establish the optimal dosing regime for each injury model (i.e. number of administered cells, number of doses); (iii) establish efficacy using the following analyses: blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, albuminuria, urine albumin/creatinine ratio and novel-FDA qualified biomarkers of renal toxicity which reflect different regions of the nephron, such as Kim-1, NGAL, NAG and Cystatin C. The extent of fibrosis will be determined quantitatively using established histological and immunohistological assays. We will use a novel transcutaneous device to measure GFR in living animals.
2. Determining the safety of KSC and MSC therapies in mice with IR and Adr-induced kidney injury
In order to evaluate the safety of the cell therapies, we will monitor the biodistribution of the transplanted cells in our injury models, using a combination of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). Tissues and organs populated by the cells will then be subjected to safety evaluation. These in vivo imaging experiments will also allow us to assess the biodistribution of the administered cells within the kidney itself.
Targets to be met: Using biomarker and pathology assays, we will determine if any of the cell therapies cause adverse reactions; i.e. (i) inflammation, (ii) fibrosis, (iii) mal-differentiation or (iv) tumourigenesis in the tissues they populate.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>N/A</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50405</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sao Paulo</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Camara group, Sao Paulo, Brazil</gtr:description><gtr:id>23E64F9D-964C-415F-BF61-C5B8BC883ECE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We expect the collaboration will lead to a joint research publication. The collaboration led to the submission of an EU Marie Curie Innovative Training Network proposal in January 2016 which included the Brazilian team but unfortunately, this was not successful.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Brazilian team hosted our visit in summer of 2015. Members of the Brazilian team visited Liverpool in September 2015 to participate in an international conference organised by the Liverpool team (NephroTools 3rd International Conference), and to discuss collaborative research findings.

During our visit to Brazil in the summer of 2015, the Brazil team provided training in undertaking a mouse renal ischaemia reperfusion injury model which we have now established in our lab at Liverpool.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A member of my research team, Ilaria Santeramo, and myself visited Brazil in the summer of 2015 for 3 months and 6 weeks, respectively for the following purposes: learn how to undertake the renal ischaemia reperfusion injury model in mice; learn how to isolate and characterise extracellular vesicles; learn how to perform a range of immunological assays; train the Brazilian researchers how to meaure the glomerular filtration rata in awake animals using a novel electronic device; train the Brazilian researchers how to isolate and culture human kidney-derived progenitor cells.

Although the grant ended in Jan 2016, our groups are keen to maintain the collaboration, and to this end, I visited Brazil for 2 weeks in August 2016 to discuss our joint project and provide advice on the cell tracking experiments that were underway in the Brazil lab and to outline further experiments that would be needed to support a publication. 

Due to the economic downturn in Brazil which has led to the devaluation of the 'real' (Brazilian currency), things are now difficult for Brazilian researchers; for instance, it is more difficult to secure research funding and the cost of undertaking research is much more expensive due to the fact that many of the consumables are imported. I feel that an important contribution I made was to encourage an exceptionally talented undergraduate student from the Brazil team, Tamiris Borges Da Silva, to apply to the University of Liverpool's Wellcome Trust PhD programme. Tamiris was hoping to pursue a scientific career but the economic situation meant that there were no studentships available to her in Brazil. Her application to our WT programme was successful and she is now in her 1st year of study. I am optimistic that having Tamiris undertake PhD studies in our group will facilitate our continued link with the Brazil team.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit to University of Sao Paulo</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C99949F2-05C9-4D57-B9E1-917A8D50C014</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During my time in brazil in summner 2015, I gave several lectures to University students and patient groups relating to the work of the joint collaboration and potential future impact.

Typically, groups of animals need to be culled at set time points to obtain sufficient blood to undertake renal function analyses. By using the device, it is possible to monitor renal function in the same animal over time. As well as reducing animal numbers, the device gives more accurate information about renal function than blood biochemical analyses.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Evaluating kidney function in awake mice</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5193815A-DE98-4782-B3D3-198613EB058E"><gtr:id>5193815A-DE98-4782-B3D3-198613EB058E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Overexpression of the MRI Reporter Genes Ferritin and Transferrin Receptor Affect Iron Homeostasis and Produce Limited Contrast in Mesenchymal Stem Cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International journal of molecular sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/be943c808354c333261647a7e3ae2a9b"><gtr:id>be943c808354c333261647a7e3ae2a9b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pereira SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1422-0067</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/76BC67DA-2C56-40CD-8019-8ABB08BB5381"><gtr:id>76BC67DA-2C56-40CD-8019-8ABB08BB5381</gtr:id><gtr:title>Design considerations for the synthesis of polymer coated iron oxide nanoparticles for stem cell labelling and tracking using MRI.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical Society reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5035edf2ebc5c5786b97b8b72ddbda71"><gtr:id>5035edf2ebc5c5786b97b8b72ddbda71</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barrow M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0306-0012</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/96AE10E6-1DE5-4C3C-B8E7-D118BA82E853"><gtr:id>96AE10E6-1DE5-4C3C-B8E7-D118BA82E853</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tailoring the surface charge of dextran-based polymer coated SPIONs for modulated stem cell uptake and MRI contrast.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biomaterials science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5035edf2ebc5c5786b97b8b72ddbda71"><gtr:id>5035edf2ebc5c5786b97b8b72ddbda71</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barrow M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2047-4830</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/66520E72-7F82-4497-9ABD-B652982902A6"><gtr:id>66520E72-7F82-4497-9ABD-B652982902A6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evaluating the effectiveness of transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) as a magnetic resonance reporter gene.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Contrast media &amp; molecular imaging</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/be943c808354c333261647a7e3ae2a9b"><gtr:id>be943c808354c333261647a7e3ae2a9b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pereira SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1555-4309</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C1E99FAB-A78B-4D01-A98A-1AA4934BB5B7"><gtr:id>C1E99FAB-A78B-4D01-A98A-1AA4934BB5B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Potential of Nanomaterials for Drug Delivery, Cell Tracking, and Regenerative Medicine 2014</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Nanomaterials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9b5bb7ae5a78b7843e813456f552eba8"><gtr:id>9b5bb7ae5a78b7843e813456f552eba8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vasilev K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M026256/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>2EEE0958-6BE1-4D16-B86B-5D954CD37219</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Renal and Urogenital</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>DD81206B-5EB4-4BCC-AEF7-808A64606E0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.2  Cellular and gene therapies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
