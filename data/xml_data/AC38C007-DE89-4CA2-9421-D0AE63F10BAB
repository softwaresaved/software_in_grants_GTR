One hundred years of hegemonic dominance from Western, predominantly Hollywood, values and aesthetics may have created a long term effect on how filmmakers in the developing world, and independent filmmakers in the developed world, tell stories cinematically. Digital technology is, however, making the filmmaking form accessible, opening up opportunities for diverse individuals and cultures to express their own identities through film. The explosion of filmmaking in black sub-Saharan Africa, the emergence of a strong Latin American cinema and the empowerment of independent filmmaking evident in South East Asia are but a few examples of the consequence of the democratisation not only of production technologies, but means of distribution and exhibition. As filmmakers in the developing world become more confident about their filmmaking and their own identities, how is this growing confidence going to challenge notions of quality, visual aesthetic, narrative structure and story themes for so long set by aspirations towards Western cinema?

A team of practice led researchers from leading film education institutions in each of the countries of Malaysia (Multimedia University), Ghana (National Film and Television Institute), Colombia (National University of Colombia) and the UK, led by Professor Erik Knudsen from the University of Salford, will run a series of workshops for emerging independent filmmakers in developing countries on three continents. A unique feature of this network is the lateral collaboration that it will encourage between practice led film and media researchers in developing countries across continents. This team of four researchers will collaborate with the host institutions involved to deliver these workshops over the period of the network project, followed by a summarising symposium hosted by the University of Salford at MediaCityUK.

Utilising interdisciplinary approaches inspired from music and anthropology, the Research Network will develop a methodology entitled Ethnomediaology. An interdisciplinary approach inspired by practices in Ethnomusicology and Autoethnography, Ethnomediaology involves the active and immersive participation of researchers in the research culture and process, using this active personal engagement as a basis for knowledge generation, data gathering and evaluation.

The StoryLab Research Network seeks to explore the following questions: What are the consequences for the democratisation of the means of filmmaking and film dissemination on how filmmakers in the developing world tell cinematic stories and in what ways are these stories, and their mode of expression, reflecting a different perspective on living in an increasingly globalised world? In what ways may these emerging narrative developments impact cinematic storytelling in the UK and beyond?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Pathways to impact will be built around the key objectives of the StoryLab Research Network and its dissemination strategy. To this end, the project anticipates that the following people and groups of people will be directly impacted by the Network's activities:

Filmmakers in Malaysia, Ghana and Colombia:

There will be a group of around 45 participant filmmakers from 3 continents who will be directly impacted by participating in the StoryLab Research Network's workshops. Their experience and workshop outcomes should, in turn, indirectly impact their local networks of peers, collaborators and colleagues. These participants will be independent filmmakers from each of the catchment areas of the institutions involved. The interdisciplinary ethnomediaological approach, with its hybrid interactive approach to project development and data gathering, should result in diverse and innovative films being made by participants following on from their workshop experience. Word of mouth by participating filmmakers will play a significant part in the proliferation of the Research Network's aims and objectives.

The research process and the research outcomes may play a significant enabling role in the ongoing development of filmmakers in the respective countries and their confidence in evolving film narratives that are independent of dominant hegemonies.

Filmmakers in the UK:

The influence of diasporic communities on mainstream British culture is plain to see in such areas as music and food. It is therefore plausible that diasporic filmmaking could influence independent filmmaking in the UK. Linking the work being done in Malaysia, Ghana and Colombia through a symposium held at one of the centres of UK media production, MediaCityUK, will enable the project to reach, in particular, but by no means exclusively, diasporic British filmmakers. In addition to the symposium, the online presence of the project though its living blog will provide a forum for interaction and debate across continents and give British independent filmmakers direct access to project activities and debates initiated as part of this Research Network.

The Research Network's outcomes could play a role in inspiring ethnic minority and disaporic British filmmakers to seek an engagement with, and inspiration from, developments taking shape in filmmaking in the developing world with a view to challenging and questioning hegemonic aspirations that dominate mainstream British independent film.

Audiences in Malaysia, Ghana, Colombia and the UK:

By articulating and encouraging innovation and diversity in filmmakers in the countries involved - Malaysia, Ghana and Colombia - there is likely to be a direct impact on local audiences as they become more diversely served by the filmmakers who emerge from their midsts.

Policy Makers in Malaysia, Ghana, Colombia and the UK:

The Research Project aims to take advantage of the prominent positions each institution has in their respective countries to alert key policy makers, including film and media development executives, of the Research Network and its activities. This engagement will be reinforced by the distribution of the Network's summary report and invitations to attend the concluding symposium at the University of Salford's MediaCityUK campus. The online blog will also provide opportunities for policy makers to engage with the Network's projects and the activities.

The potential impact on policy could be that current pre-occupations with focusing on North American influences and aspirations could be redirected to recognising the emerging role of the developing world, its values, its aesthetics and its formalistic approaches as a means of unlocking currently excluded and undervalued talents in British independent film and film in general.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35151</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M006336/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>AC38C007-DE89-4CA2-9421-D0AE63F10BAB</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/M006336/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>35151.79</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>3D78A079-B322-43FA-BA3C-8CB20B6C649B</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/M006336/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>27031.7</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
