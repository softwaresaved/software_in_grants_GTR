Constructivists, according to Street, claim that we justify normative judgments not by discovering truth about facts that are independent of our reasoning, but rather by ensuring that we have reasoned correctly about the domain that is governed by these norms. \n\nWhat Street calls restricted forms of constructivism apply this proposal to some subset of normative judgements. Thus John Rawls understood correct principles of justice as those that would be chosen in a certain ideal circumstances by a procedure designed to represent certain core moral and political values. What Street calls thoroughgoing constructivism seeks a constructivist understanding of all normative judgements. \n\nConstructivism is sometimes represented as a distinctive and radical metaethical position, anti-realist in spirit. Street so takes it, as does Rawls, writing in 'Kantian Constructivism in Moral Theory' that 'apart from the procedure of constructing the principles of justice, there are no moral facts'. It is particularly distinctive of constructivist views to take the constructive procedure in question as determining the relevant normative facts and not merely tracking them. The relevant set of practical norms have no independent existence (independent, that is, of human reasoning and deliberation) and therefore cannot be discovered like physical rules or facts. Rather they have to be constructed by way of a deliberative and rational process guided by a general understanding of the purposes of these norms and the nature of the creatures they are meant to govern. The process through which norms are constructed is also supposed to justify their authority over those whose actions they are meant to govern.\n\nNumerous questions are raised by this philosophical agenda. Does it really map out a clearly distinctive position? Doubts have been raised on this score, notably with reference to Korsgaard's constructivism in recent work by Hussein and Shah and with reference to Scanlon's constructivism by Pettit and others. What insights does it offer to understanding the epistemology, semantics and metaphysics of the normative domains where it purports to cast light? How does it relate to such familiar views as expressivism, relativism and realism? Does it necessarily compete with them or merely offer a subsidiary form of them, perhaps plugging gaps in their explanatory success? Can constructivism be distinguished, at the end of the day, from other metaethical positions from which it is often supposed distinct? What if anything does it imply about the truth-aptness of moral claims? How should we understand the relations between and the relative merits of various forms of constructivism found in the literature, notably between those inspired by Kant (Rawls, Korsgaard and to some extent Scanlon), by Hobbes (most notably Gauthier) and by Hume (Street, Tiberius, Lenman). How helpful are analogies between constructivism in ethics and in other domains of philosophy where talk of constructivism has been important, as in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nConstructivism generates great interest in its promise to avoid what its proponents see as, on the one hand, the epistemological and metaphysical vexations of traditional forms of realism and, on the other hand, the heteronomy and sense of 'changing the subject' that are thought to accompany reductive forms of naturalism. This, together with the recent surge of writing on the topic and the potential connections with debates in other areas of philosophy justifies in our mind a new collection of papers on this topic and a series of meetings dedicated to its deeper exploration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25062</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2F6CF3F6-9E46-414B-A2DF-20BDE87DE7A2"><gtr:id>2F6CF3F6-9E46-414B-A2DF-20BDE87DE7A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constructivism in Practical Philosophy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1e2221c653a8c4d1b21331aa3a9f6aef"><gtr:id>1e2221c653a8c4d1b21331aa3a9f6aef</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lenman J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199609833</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G00269X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
