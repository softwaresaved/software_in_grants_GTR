This forms part of an integrated plan which will result in new analysis and, importantly, design tools for industry (in the form of a stand alone application) as well as results of significant industrial relevance. In addition to the modelling component of the project, validation experiments will be undertaken to ensure that the results are thoroughly tested and able to be further exploited.This significant piece of work will run in parallel (with a staggered later start) with a Leverhulme Trust (LT) two year research project which is concerned with the more theoretical and fundamental aspects of the project, specifically the two dimensional analysis and development of the theoretical framework. The project proposed here would extend the analysis to three dimensions and undertake the experimental validation of the work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Knowledge (Techniques) One of the most exciting areas of lubrication research is in developing the understanding of the lubrication mechanisms involved in bearings with topographical features. Such topological features have been shown to either reduce friction or delay the onset of the mixed lubrication regime from the ElastoHydrodynamic Lubrication (EHL) regime (which in turn reduces friction). The limitations of classical lubrication analysis have prevented topographies from being accurately analysed in a global sense (see proposal). The method proposed here would address this and allow such bearings to be analysed. In addition to this analysis the optimisation of the bearing and lubricant choice has been included in the proposal. The route to impact for the knowledge and techniques based outcomes of the project will be though the publication of the results of the three dimensional and validated models in high quality peer reviewed journals as well as being presented at the Leeds-Lyon Conference in 2011. Economy (Products and Procedures) The outcome of the project will be modelling tools to better model the design of bearings and lubricants. The purpose of including this stage is to provide a demonstration of the analysis technique and how it can practically be used to design bearings based on real multidisciplinary industrial requirements. The work proposed here builds on work to be undertaken on the more fundamental analyses funded by the Leverhulme Trust and make it industrially exploitable. The project therefore comprehensively spans the theoretical aspects of the modelling through to a tool that demonstrates the concepts and potential to UK Industry of the modelling techniques developed. Such tools will allow advanced surfaces to be developed, increasing the competitiveness of bearings in a wide range of applications, including transport applications, power generation and process industries. There will be a number of routes to economic impact. The first is through the provision of the tools directly to industry and through consultation with industry. The work will also be presented at an international conference which is well attended by industry. In addition to the routes mentioned above the relationship with industry that the School of Mechanical Engineering has will provide informal channels of exploitation, for example the applicant recently obtained funding from a large polymeric bearing manufacture to examine elastohydrodynamic lubrication in one of their designs. This is clearly related to the project proposed here.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100949</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The work has been presented to a number of companies in the UK and Japan, and the approach is being considered in the design of bearings at a UK based company.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>033B455F-EC5E-428E-9ADD-D015960697C0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The development of a multiscale approach to analyse bearing with topography was developed successfully.
