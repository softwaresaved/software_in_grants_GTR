A major advance in the treatment of the blood vessel complications in these diseases is the use of agents which block the function of a protein termed Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). We have been directly involved in the development of treatments which block VEGF function in eye disease. However, we and others have also shown that VEGF may be important in the health and function of neurons, including those of the retina and brain. In fact, VEGF is being developed as a treatment to promote survival of neurons in patients with motor neuron disease. Could long-term blocking of the blood vessel defects in the retina with VEGF antagonists inadvertently harm the neurons, which ultimately are responsible for vision? We propose studies to better understand the potential risks and to determine details about the mechanisms by which VEGF promotes neuron survival.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Therapeutic manipulation of vascular growth has become a major focus in the treatment of human disease, and a key target in this arena is Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A). However, data continue to suggest that VEGF-A has neuro-developmental, neurotrophic and neuroprotective roles and that it may exert these effects directly on neuronal cell types, independently of its vascular actions. We have previously established roles for VEGF-A in motor neuron migration, and most recently, in the protection of retinal neurons from acute ischaemia-triggered apoptosis. We hypothesise that VEGF-A is an endogenous neuroprotectant in the retina which has an important role in retinal neuron survival/function in neurovascular disease. A better understanding of VEGF-A?s role in retinal neuroprotection is urgently needed, given the increase in use of VEGF antagonists in ischaemic retinal disease, such as diabetic retinopathy. The objectives of this proposal are to determine if VEGF-A has a role in protecting neurons in animal models of more chronic retinal disease, such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, and to use an in vitro system to dissect the signalling pathways critical for VEGF-mediated neuroprotection in retinal ganglion cells. It is anticipated that the results of this project will give us greater mechanistic understanding of VEGF-A based neuroprotection, and determine whether there are risks that need to be better assessed and understood as we develop novel treatments for retinal disease. Longer term, insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying VEGF-A activity may offer an opportunity to develop novel neuroprotectants and more sophisticated treatments that attenuate the pathological vessel growth, oedema, inflammation, and haemorrhage associated with VEGF-A in neovascular disease, but do not compromise its neuroprotective properties.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>454483</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Ophthalmology</gtr:department><gtr:description>VEGF in neuroprotection in spontaneous CNV</gtr:description><gtr:id>72BA8FEA-DBAD-4EB1-9665-4223E2D78E2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>So far we have generated data suggesting that anti-VEGF reduce retinal neurone survival, and is still working on the effects of exogenous neuroprotectants with anti-VEGF in this model.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partner is interested in neuroprotection as a adjunct therapy for anti-VEGF for neovascular AMD, and they mostly provided the animals and the funding for the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>By using a spontaneous CNV model developed, we examine the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on survival of retinal neurons, and also to test the protective effects of various neuroprotectants commercial available with anti-VEGF.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cardiff University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Ophthalmology</gtr:department><gtr:description>In vitro retinal ganglion cell death biomarkers study</gtr:description><gtr:id>1217B019-35FF-4F0D-B679-44CE26083B78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have successfully transfered the protocl and our collaborators are using the model for their study since late 2010.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The cell death pathway(s) that they are testing now will be critically important to us in understanding the molecular mechanism of how VEGF is protecting the RGC neurons.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our team transferred our novel ganaglion cell culture protocol to our collaborator so that they can study the biomarkers for cell death in vitro.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London (UCL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UCL Institute of Child Health</gtr:department><gtr:description>The roles of different VEGF-A isoforms in experimental model of diabetic nephropathy</gtr:description><gtr:id>3873B9CD-4CEA-4EAE-9846-9B7D36463524</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have successfuly establish these experimental diabetes models, and will soon test them in the VEGF-A isoform-specific background.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborators introduced a different aspect of VEGF biology to our research, namely the role of VEGF-A in kidney pathology which we can draw parallel to the role of VEGF in eye diseases moving forward with our projects.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>By adopting both the STZ-induced diabetes and the Akita gentic model of diabetes, in a eNOS knock-out background using our VEGF-A isoform-specific mice, we can determine the role of different VEGF-A isoforms in development of diabetic nephropathy.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London (UCL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UCL Institute of Child Health</gtr:department><gtr:description>D-PUFA in retinal protection</gtr:description><gtr:id>3278C391-0D0B-456A-9E45-53973DD3E5A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We successfully implemented GC/MS procedures to detect and quantify the levels of D-PUFA incorporated into cells in vitro, which was used to confrim the levels of protection by D-PUFA and incorportation levels.
