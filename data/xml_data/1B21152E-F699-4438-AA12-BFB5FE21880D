of electronic waste</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L01582X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The United Kingdom is one of Europe's main producers of electronic-waste (e-waste). Despite strict EU regulations and control programmes, a substantial part of British e-waste is exported to developing countries, where it is often recycled through environmentally harmful methods or dumped in unprotected areas, causing severe environmental damage accompanied by a range of socio-cultural problems. Despite this, public debate on digital technologies in Britain and other post-industrial countries has been primarily focused on the economic and social benefits of technological innovation.

Digital performance arts practices have largely been complicit in this narrative. On the one hand, their primary interest has been in the exploration and showcasing of state of the art innovations; on the other, critical practices in the field have been restricted to the politics of a western, post-industrial cultural framework. Digital performance arts practitioners have rarely engaged with the material and socio-economic aspects of technology in terms of their production, and their 'afterlife' as electronic waste. 

Bodies of Planned Obsolescence is a one-year international research networking project in which performance artists, art curators, scientists and cultural theorists will exchange and develop performance-based approaches to digital arts and the cultural and environmental aspects of the global economy of electronic waste. By re-functioning e-waste materials, digital arts practices will make the economic and ecological issues visible. By interaction with colleagues from other disciplines, the artists' impact will be augmented by scientific and socio-economic findings. The network overall will develop innovative international research collaborations with researchers from the UK as a country that exports a substantial part of its e-waste, and two countries that import e-waste: Nigeria and China. 

This project will include the following key elements:
-Launch event at the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum, London
-Workshop &amp;amp; symposium in Hong Kong and Guiyu, China, combining paper and performance presentations with participation in labour processes at an e-waste recycling facility.
-Workshop &amp;amp; symposium in Lagos Nigeria, including practice-based explorations of e-waste dumping sites.
-Public conference/arts event at Watermans Art Centre in London, UK, which combines academic presentations with the creation of new performance work with electronic waste re-imported from Nigeria.

The focus on digital performance practices in Bodies of Planned Obsolescence is driven by the notion that critical practices in performance arts can constitute an intervention in broader cultural performative practices around understandings of - and engagement with - technology. An innovative aspect of Bodies of Planned Obsolescence is its methodological approach to practice-based research, which builds on anthropologist Tim Ingold's insight that not only art, but also anthropology, archaeology, and architecture should be practiced as 'thinking through making', instead of a focus on theorizing an externalized world..

Bodies of Planned Obsolescence seeks to extend Ingold's approach into collaborative work in the field of science and arts. Thus, practice-based research in digital performance arts is not only conceived as building on - and responding to - academic and scientific theory, as is often the case in science-arts collaborations, but also constitutes a process of 'blue-sky' experimentation, which may play an initiating role in discourse and research in other disciplines, as well as establish alternate modes of dissemination of scientific and humanities research on e-waste outside academia.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Key impact areas:
1) Arts Practitioners
Collaborations with leading arts organizations will open the different events of the network to broader local audiences of professional artists. A collaboration with the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum Digital Programmes department has been agreed, which will involve the inclusion of project activities in the V&amp;amp;A Digital Design Weekend. This is one of the UK's leading networking platforms for digital artists, which also reaches a broad audience of the general public (see below). In Nigeria, a collaboration with the Lagos Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) will facilitate involvement of the Lagos performance and new media art community, whilst an outreach to the professional artist community in Hong Kong is currently being discussed with the Hong Kong Performance Art Project of the Asian Art Archive. The Principal Investigator, Dr Dani&amp;euml;l Ploeger, will bring to the network a number of internationally recognized performance artists who have worked extensively in a science-art context. The participating artists - in addition to the project website and public media channels (see below) - will be important liaisons for further dissemination of the project's outcomes and activities in arts communities outside academia.

2) General Audience
The network's public event in London, as well as part of the workshops in Lagos and Guiyu/Hong Kong will take place at venues open to the general public that already draw a broad audience. All events will be free of charge. The project's events and its outcomes will also be brought to the attention of the general public through the following channels:
-Participant Irini Papadimitriou, Digital Programmes Manager at the V&amp;amp;A Museum and Head of New Media Arts Development at the Watermans Art Centre, London, will include UK-based activities in the programmes of both the V&amp;amp;A Museum and the Watermans Art Centre. 
-The CI is active in educational projects around waste and ecology in Hong Kong and is a chartered mmber of the YMCA youth organization. In these roles, she will integrate the project's themes, methodologies and outcomes into learning activities for secondary school students.
-The Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) is Lagos' main contemporary arts venue with a broad and loyal audience from the general public. The centre will integrate the project into their public programme.
-The project website will play a central role in the dissemination of information about project activities. In addition, the site will constitute a publicly accessible archive, which will remain available after the project's completion.

3) Policy Makers
The network is also aimed at disseminating its processes and outcomes to policy makers, and the inclusion of policy makers and lobbying groups in the public elements of the network's activities in the three countries. Connections to various bodies affiliated with environmental policy making have been established and will be further developed, building on network members' existing affiliations: The CI is a member of the Environmental Management Association of Hong Kong, participant Prof Oladele Osibanjo is a leading expert in the global trade of e-waste and a key person in the Secretariat of the Basel Convention the world's most important policy making body concerned with e-waste.

4) Media impact
Peter Dammann, a World Press Photo award winning photographer with extensive experience in the documentation of the social dimensions of cultural and industrial activity in developing countries, has generously agreed to document the project on the basis of reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses. Dammann has important connections to relevant journalists in the field of international development who are interested to write about the project. The network's activities and outcomes will also be disseminated to the press through the PR offices of the Watermans Art Centre, and the Centre for Contemporary Arts Lagos.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35148</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Bodies of Planned Obsolescence exhibition was a collimation all of the artists' artistic reactions to their personal findings and experiences of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>75A0DC33-3106-483E-91FE-06BE4FB9CAC5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition was widely attended by artists, researchers and general public alike.

It blows household dust, removed from the inside of a computer carcass, into the air. The continual movement of dust is contained in the piece. However, the ceaseless creation and motion of unconfined dust accompanies all stages of the e-waste journey.

Dust has pervaded this project, in many and unexpected ways. We have been covered in dust, breathed dust, and been infected by dust. Dust has been a surprising and provocative companion.

Our first encounter with 'fresh' e-waste, at the V&amp;amp;A, was disappointing due to the absence of dust covering the freshly disposed carcasses. Also a surprise was the amount of dust we found inside the discarded computers we dismantled in Hong Kong. These machines suck in dust in startling quantities. The dust, both present and absent, in these two cases was very much the familiar dust of everyday domestic life; the stuff we find clinging to our furniture and filling our vacuum cleaners. It is the organic dust of human skin debris, pet hairs and dust mites; a fertile, rich medium.

The other types of dust we have encountered have been much more dangerous. This has reminded us that dust is not a stuff but a category. What comprises specific dusts varies with the activities and locations where we find e-waste processing. Inorganic dusts comprising heavy metals, and other toxic and indigestible fragments, poison and infect people, animals, and the land itself. Most startling was the dense layer, thick as fur, of metal and plastic dust that coats the machinery at high-tech recycling factories.

These different varieties of dust extract various kinds of revenge; familiar, organic dust clogs the machine, accelerating its journey to obsolescence, while the dangerous dust of e-waste processing retaliates against both individual bodies and the social body whose hubris set the whole process in motion. A measure of dust for a measure of dust. - Neil Maycroft</gtr:description><gtr:id>D9F63107-A8CD-42D3-B7FD-8053EB77A9DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact and contribution to the projects Exhibition at Watermans as a culmination of findings.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Artwork - Dust-off (Neil Maycroft)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ewasteperformance.tumblr.com/post/130130300824/exhibition-at-watermans</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>ELECTRONIC 506 (garbage cyborg)

Alaba, Lagos
February 12&amp;amp;14, 2015
Arriving at Alaba market, plasma screens boast their sizes, the high volume speaker output defies the unruly street noises. Walk against the traffic, snake through the kekes, make yourself invisible, the sky opens up as we reach the end-of-market's e-waste dumpsite.
A landscape fictionalized - cows fed on the e-waste roam the hills, weight scale hung aloft, loads of metal parts carried by heads, old TVs transported by hand trucks, boys, young men, elders, dealers, buyers, sellers engage with each other - unscrewing, hammering, sorting, pounding, weighing, Naira exchange hands. Smoke rises as un-wanted cables and parts are burnt on the not-so-distant hills.
At the workshop space, I work with/for Basiru, 26 year old, who dissects circuit boards for parts that can be recycled and worthy of some Naira.
Aluminum - 170ngn per KG
Copper - 1000ngn per KG 
Blue panel - 800ngn per KG
Resister - 100ngn per KG
(1ngn=Nigerian Naira=0.004euro)
The workers form a circle around the pile of circuit boards. Basiru hammers down the board, retrieves the parts containing copper, I untangle the copper threads. All valuable parts are sorted, each in its own storage pots. Some chitchats are exchanged in native tongues. The sun is high, the pile goes from high to low and high again as more are dumped constantly. The 'un'natural resources seem to be inexhaustible. Make and unmake, the technology chases its own tails. Print and unprint, the broken circuits fail the promises.

We receive startled responses from the policymaker and scientist-dominated audience at the eclectic mix of cultural theorists, scientists and artists that make up our group surely must appear curious to somebody working in industrial recycling or toxicology research; the idea of rethinking and 're-doing' (whatever this may turn out to be) of electronic waste through this odd collective's hands-on exploration of recycling labour.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.jceia.org/#!e-waste-and-global-exchange/c11ie</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article/Interview: e-waste, porn, ecology &amp; warfare.

A pile of discarded computers, telephones, printers, and microwaves were delivered to the museum. This material was explored by four artists specialized in consumer electronics and waste, during a workshop open to visitors. The day concluded with a presentation of the work-in-progress by the artists, in discussion with the two cultural theorists.

The event was attended throughout the day by museum visitors. The closing presentation was attended by 50-60 people. The discussion revealed that visitors' perception of their daily interaction with technology had changed and raised further questions that they'd like to investigate.

-Electronic devices and e-waste have often been considered from either a scientific, cultural theoretical, or artistic perspective. The funded research showed that electronic waste recycling is a socio-material process, which should be studied from a practice-based approach where toxicological aspects are considered in the context of the cultural context in which recycling takes place, and vice-versa.
-In interdisciplinary practice-based research involving artists, the practical component has often been limited to artistic practice. Instead, practical activities that are not primarily conceived as artistic should be explored more in-depth to facilitate a truly interdisciplinary practical exchange. The funded research developed initial approaches in this field, both in terms of research process and development and presentation of outputs. E.g. the end presentation at Watermans in London, included a combination of artefacts, artworks and texts, mostly produced collaboratively by participants from different disciplinary backgrounds.
-In the Global North, electronic devices are often marketed and experienced as communication and style items, largely disconnected from their materiality in terms of production and waste. Practice-based engagement with well-established e-waste recycling processes is not only a fruitful way to investigate issues directly connected to waste, but also a possible avenue to reconnect with the materiality of digital technologies in Western consumer contexts. This approach can form the basis of novel media art practices.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research outcomes can be used as starting points in the development of methodologies in future research in electronic devices and waste in toxicology, cultural studies of technology and digital performance arts.
Furthermore, the project's creative approach to recycling work and industrial processes can serve as a starting point for campaigns to inform and engage the general public in the context of education, industry, and environmental policy activities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>404B84AD-5E14-4E9D-927B-BBDE09B9B4C8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ewasteperformance.tumblr.com/post/130130300824/exhibition-at-watermans</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/471F0C21-9064-45E1-965D-79476A903958"><gtr:id>471F0C21-9064-45E1-965D-79476A903958</gtr:id><gtr:title>Abject Digital Performance: Engaging the politics of electronic waste</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Leonardo</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f3a8f9a020fbeaad76f1e35cf4639e4e"><gtr:id>f3a8f9a020fbeaad76f1e35cf4639e4e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ploeger, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E3C82FF8-F562-45EB-A9D4-63FC1A02B660"><gtr:id>E3C82FF8-F562-45EB-A9D4-63FC1A02B660</gtr:id><gtr:title>Doing International Research: Global and Local Methods</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fe40fb79dd3d63fd7aa965052535fe04"><gtr:id>fe40fb79dd3d63fd7aa965052535fe04</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams Christopher</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781473926967</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D50B1BE0-7B5E-4ACB-8CBB-AF0D3479BE8B"><gtr:id>D50B1BE0-7B5E-4ACB-8CBB-AF0D3479BE8B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Doing International Research: Global and Local Methods</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fe40fb79dd3d63fd7aa965052535fe04"><gtr:id>fe40fb79dd3d63fd7aa965052535fe04</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams Christopher</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>1473926963</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L01582X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8BB67751-1AD5-4EE8-9104-089D5F236DDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Digital Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A600D1CC-E752-4522-95BC-916168B6C71B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Waste Minimisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
