&lt;p>First, the policy debate over whether to separate specific banking activities (Volcker rule and Vickers report) depends on whether the benefits of a diversification outweigh the information problems from complexity.The study will estimate whether the equity prices of large banks in the UK and Euro have a diversity premium or discount.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Second, there is general agreement that more competition in banking is good, yet many 'challenger' banks were excessively leveraged and subsequently failed.

&lt;p>Third, banks today operate simultaneously as traditional institutions and in parallel (shadow bank) markets. The study will consider which parallel banking markets ought to be within the regulatory framework and what would be the consequences. These issues are central to the ESRC?s strategic objective of improving economic performance and rebalancing the economy.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>IMPACT SUMMARY

The following is a list of some of the likely beneficiaries from this research project. A short description of how they will benefit is included.

1. HM Treasury
The Treasury is responsible for implementing the Independent Commission on Banking's (ICB) recommendations. The ring-fencing of retail bank operations is at a conceptual level and this research project will identify the benefits and limits of diversification of businesses within a single institution. The Treasury may also benefit from an independent assessment of the macro-financial strengths and weaknesses of the UK banking system.
2. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
As the successor to the FSA the FCA must ensure the efficiency of financial markets. The role of competition in the efficiency of retail and wholesale markets is central to meeting this mandate. Whether different types of banks choose to operate with higher capital ratios will also be of interest. The analysis of 'trust' in UK banks may also influence the agenda. 
3. Bank of England
The structure of the financial sector can influence the industrial structure of an economy. The analysis and policy proposals around financial structure therefore has implications for the UK economic performance and Monetary Policy Committee. The stability of correlations between different types of banking will be of interest to the Financial Policy Committee. 
4. Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards
While the Commission is likely to have completed its work before this research project concludes, the early findings are likely to be of interest. In particular, quantification of the factors which are correlated with different levels of trust in banks will be of interest. 
We will engage with these public sector institutions on a regular, informal and private basis. We anticipate sharing our findings as they emerge and ahead of other stakeholders.

5. Banking sector
A central element of this research project is the Consultation Forum of small banks and similar financial institutions. The Forum is an opportunity for participants to exchange views of the changing regulatory environment, comment on the direction of the research (although the analysis will remain fully independent), and discuss implications for organisations on a confidential basis. 
6. European Banking Authority (EBA)
The Banking Stakeholder Group of the EBA is likely to benefit from the analysis of the drivers of bank trust. While the sample does not extend to Euro area banks, the finding from studying UK banks are likely to be informative. The analysis of the diversification of the banking system will include Euro area banks.
7. Competition commission
This project will provide evidence on whether competition has declined in the banking sector beyond simply observing that the number of banks has declined. The analysis of competition and stability as complements or substitutes will also be of interest.
The Consultation Forum is for smaller banks with perhaps one larger institution. However, we expect to invite the competition commission and regulatory authorities and sub-groups of the EBA to meetings where appropriate. 

8. General Public 
The failures of bank governance and the Libor scandal since the ICB recommendations have re-opened the debate on the future of the UK banking industry. This research project will provide an empirical basis to inform this debate well ahead of the ICB changes in 2019. The functional analysis of the financial system and alternative institutional arrangements may also be of interest to the general public.
9. International Monetary Fund
The issues addressed in this research project are likely to be of interest to other countries and institutions charged with overseeing the international financial system. 
Engagement with the public is most likely to be through our publications and reporting through the media and in particular social media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80835</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>One of our papers were used to influence the Parliamentary Commission on Bankiing, and the ongoing discussion on competition in banking.

Our first paper investigated the relationship between competition and stability. There is a long standing debate about whether competition and stability are complements (as implied by the ICB's mandate) or substitutes. Davis and Karim (2013) used two measures of competition (the H and Lerner statistics) to see whether competition leads to greater or less bank specific risk (measured by a Z statistic for each bank of the return on assets plus leverage ratio scaled by the distribution of returns). The dataset covered EU banks between 1998-2012. It was found that different levels of competition across countries was not systematically related to risk. However, changes in competition were found to increase rather than reduce the riskiness of banks. We believe this is the first time this dynamic relationship has been measured.
Our second paper considered the rationale for the recommendation to 'ring-fencing' retail from wholesale banking activities. Armstrong and Fic (2014) investigate whether banks with more diversified businesses trade at a premium (reduce risk) or discount (too complex) to other banks. This will indicate whether markets judge that simpler and more concentrated banking is likely to be consistent with greater stability. Business diversity is measured across assets and income and valuations by price-to-book and Tobin's Q. The dataset includes 831 listed banks across OECD between 1998-12. We found that for large banks greater diversity destroys value but for small banks diversity improves value. Diversified banks in Europe and the US banks seem at greatest risk of destroying value. Our findings provide some justification for the ICB recommendations.
Our third paper examines the Basel II cyclical capital buffers that are endorsed by the ICB. The idea is that banks hold a buffer of capital to absorb expected losses in bad times and accumulate capital in good times. This is inconsistent with how risk (the variance of loan losses increases along with expected losses). Armstrong and Ebell (2014) create a dynamic stochastic partial equilibrium model to show that banks are more likely to choose to hoard rather than absorb capital in bad times. This is consistent with how banks tend to behave and the earlier credit rationing literature. This is one of the few micro-founded models of bank behavior. We use numerical methods to simulate the impact of changes in risk on capital holdings and verify the behavior. While the model has been solved, we aim to refine this paper to see whether the magnitude of this precautionary response is economically significant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The motivation for carrying out this work was to inform the evolving policy towards the UK financial sector. We have already presented our initial findings at seminars and two of the papers have been released as discussion papers. However, we hope to develop two papers further and present at finance seminars at Imperial College and LSE. These papers will be submitted to journals. We also hope to present our work at the Bank of England (who are aware of the work we have done) and the European Banking Authority. We will be looking out for other opportunities to present in policy forums. One possibility is that we publish all three papers as a NIESR e-book, although that would take further time for the authors and is yet to be decided.
Competition and the design of capital regulations are at the centre of UK and international banking policy. Our papers on competition challenge the conventional wisdom among policy makers that greater competition is always beneficial and provide a more nuanced view of 'ring-fencing' banks. This is important because the current view that more competition must lead to more efficiency is not consistent with recent or past history. There is a risk of creating more vulnerabilities. We hope this work will encourage a more considered approach. The consequences of the reform are far reaching not only for the banking sector but also everyone in our economy as banking is involved in so many of our everyday transactions. 
Our work on counter-cyclical capital buffers is important to the Basel II Capital Regulations which are at the heart of international banking. We are surprised at the lack of recognition of the 'hoarding' effect and why it occurs. While there is less weight put on the capital buffers than in the past, that we show capital is likely to track in the opposite way to regulations we hope will be important. Our methodology can be applied to other areas of bank regulation, such as the consequences of contingent liabilities for banks capital behavior. Our stakeholders include domestic and international financial regulatory bodies as well as policy makers and the financial community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>50214730-6942-4AF1-86C0-EBDFC82DFDBC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://niesr.ac.uk/research-theme/financial-economics-and-regulation</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K008056/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF887C15-B29F-4C4C-8420-88AF17A8FFE1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Financial economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>50992D59-4D34-4EAD-9A21-B3ADAF426DA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Industrial Organisation (R&amp;D)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
