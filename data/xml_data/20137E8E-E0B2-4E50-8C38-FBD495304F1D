Transitional Justice and the Economic Crisis</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M011321/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>CONTEXT
The comparative project applies concepts of transitional justice, namely, 'dealing with the past', to investigate how six European societies (Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Cyprus, Iceland) have come to terms with the origins and consequences of the post-2008 financial crisis. The economic aspects of the crash are well discussed elsewhere; the proposed project argues significant political and legal lessons can be learned from the crisis, but these are missed by viewing it only through an economic lens. Simply stated, transitional justice, a framework developed over the past forty years, considers how national political elites balance popular calls for truth and justice with the pragmatic need for stability in the aftermath of crisis. Prosecutions, truth recovery and amnesties or impunity are much studied mechanisms. Notably, these mechanisms have been deployed in the cases under consideration. Spain and Portugal took only minimal steps to address the causes of the crisis, in effect, pursuing a policy of immunity. Iceland and Cyprus set up ad hoc truth commissions to document the causes of the crisis. Ireland and Greece have prosecuted and convicted a number of bankers and politicians deemed responsible. The project seeks to explain why, despite similar background conditions, societies have formulated different policy responses and to identify the strengths and limitations of each response. This is important. Examining the comparative experience of societies who experiment with policy mechanisms will contribute to the design of better policy responses in times of crisis, decreasing the level of social upheaval, boosting political legitimacy and paving the way for meaningful institutional reform. This project is explicitly about the intersection of politics and law; it focuses on issues of political and institutional failure and the role of law in promoting accountability, responsibility and political learning from economic crises. 

POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS
The project is both academic and policy relevant. At the academic level, it will use the analytical framework of transitional justice to consider why political elites in certain countries develop policies to account for the political and institutional causes of an economic crisis, while others do not. Economic perspectives now dominate relevant debates; unfortunately, these overlook issues of political and legal responsibility in times of economic crisis. The project's findings will be relevant to a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences, including politics, law, and economics, and have the potential to introduce a novel perspective to the study of economic crises.
At the same time, the scope of the project will allow it to contribute to policymaking. First, the project will explore the ways external supervision attached to IMF bailouts may affect domestic political leaders in dealing with the past. Based on empirical material collected during fieldwork and semi-structured interviews with IMF and EU executives as well as national political elites, the project will prepare and distribute policy briefings with practical recommendations to improve the design of future bailouts, creating space for issues of justice, truth and accountability to be addressed. Other policy briefings will encapsulate the central findings for each country; these will be of interest to local political elites, government departments, policymakers, and civil society activists. All briefings will be made publically available. In addition, a unique online open-access website will contain rich empirical data, including political decisions, court rulings and other legal precedents; these will be of value to lawyers, legal scholars and policymakers globally, as well as other interested parties, such as activists and NGOs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results will be targeted at two broad groups of policy users: (a) domestic policy makers, including government agencies and political elites; (b) international/ supranational organisations. 

The findings will help domestic policymakers design effective policy responses in times of economic uncertainty, addressing popular calls for justice while decreasing political upheaval and paving the way for institutional reform. The comparative nature of the project will illuminate strengths and weaknesses of various approaches (truth commissions, prosecutions, impunity) and suggest lessons to be learned from the experience of societies facing similar dilemmas. National stakeholders, including policymakers in departments of justice or the economy, designated parliamentary commissions, ombudsman bureaus, financial regulators, office of the Attorney General and central bank auditing departments, will be targeted as potential beneficiaries of the research.

There is an equal opportunity to influence the policymaking of international organisations. A key component of the project is to identify ways to improve the design of bailout programmes to create conditions conducive for societies to deal with non-economic causes of the crisis. The lessons drawn from a comparative analysis of the current crisis will help transnational institutions, such as the EU Commission (Directorate General of Justice) and the Council of Europe, to shape their policy responses based on systematic empirical evidence.

The project team has already developed links with or have pre-existing relations with policy makers in each case. For example, the PI has worked closely with key players in Greece (Central Bank of Greece and Ministry of Justice) and Spain (Ministry of the Interior). Co-I McEvoy has a 20-year relationship with the Irish Ambassador to the EU. Co-I Loizides has authored commissioned reports for the Council of Europe and has an established network of contacts with the Cypriot government, while Co-I Wheeler has worked with senior IMF executives on a number of research projects. 
The team will continue to liaise with these and other policymakers from each country to receive feedback and fine-tune the design of the project. Policymakers will also play an active role in a conference in Belfast; their feedback will maximise potential impact. 
Based on previous experience, the research team will prepare short policy briefings for each country, encapsulating major findings, making recommendations and suggesting lessons to be learned from other countries. The briefings will be available in English and in local languages and will be distributed to parliamentarians in the six countries and the IMF. Similarly, using existing structures of the University of Kent in Brussels, a dissemination workshop will be organised to inform selected members of the European parliament and executives of the EU Commission of central findings. 

To increase visibility, researchers will prepare editorials for national and international media, including the Economist, Cyprus Mail, Kathimerini, Irish Times, and local media, such as El Pais, Jornal de Noticias and Morgunbladid (members of the research team have already published in these venues). Finally, the website will provide extensive empirical information, including material published by the project, legal precedents and podcasts with presentations of participants; these will be useful to policymakers, academics, lawyers, activists, NGOs and journalists in other countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>521257</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Federal Reserve conference (Oxford)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AAE64A28-DD65-4F29-933A-E5AC719AF377</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event was a day-long workshop/conference on the role of the US Federal Reserve specifically, and central banks more generally, in reproducing inequality, held at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

However, despite the lack of concrete outputs in terms of published papers, we have made a significant progress in advancing those goals. The main work of the past eleven months has been geared towards the data collection from six European countries for the large database that will serve as the cornerstone of the project. This data has been successfully collected by the international team of Local Researchers and is organised in Zotero. The next stage is to begin to analyse the data and to produce reports and papers based on these findings. 

While we have prioritized the data collection and organisation as the necessary first stage in the project, we have also worked consistently on developing the theoretical bases of the project, and aimed to follow a rigorous publication schedule. In addition to managing the Local Researchers and building a repository of primary documents and related analysis, in December the team completed a project-wide literature review covering accountability during crisis and Transitional Justice, and a shorter, secondary literature on the role of international organisations in economic crisis. The primary review has two main foci (public accountability and Transitional Justice), and a number of sub-foci related to the primary themes of the project (the nature of crisis accountability; the role of the judiciary, central banks, and parliaments in crisis management; and political learning). Within the coverage of Transitional Justice, the following topics were covered: the expansion of the concept; the 'balance sheet' of empirical effects of TJ policies (especially trials, truth commissions and apologies); the scope conditions of TJ policies; and TJ in corporations. The secondary literature review on the role of international organisations focused on these organisations' general role as holders of accountability; ownership; conditionality; the politics of accountability in the IMF and recipient countries; and organisational learning. 

The team has also been active with its scholarly output. First a (co-authored) paper exploring the role of economic truth commissions in converting past policy failures into lessons has been accepted for publication in Political Studies. Thus far, Dr Kovras and Dr Loizides published an article in the Washington Post (Monkey Cage) summarizing the key findings of their research with regards to post-crisis constitutional amendments in Greece and Italy. Dr Hilliard attended a one-day workshop-conference at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, about the role of Central Banks in perpetuating or mitigating inequality during financial crisis. We are currently drafting the theoretical papers that will support our empirical research and thus far had a paper proposal accepted at the international Council of European Studies conference to be held in Glasgow in July 2017. This paper, entitled 'The IMF as a learning agent: the role of accountability processes in IMF policy formation', will focus on the role of international accountability norms, as promulgated by the IMF, in conditioning the outcomes of national decisions about economic policy (especially during crisis). We have also had an invitation to submit a paper on the 'pitfalls of accountability' to the Journal of Democracy, and plan to submit a full draft of this paper in March 2017. 


In early March, three team members met to develop the research instrument that we will use to complete our fieldwork. We are currently organising and arranging our main fieldwork in each of the six countries; eight trips will be taken in total (one to each country, and another trip to Washington, D.C., to interview IMF executives). Each country visit will include 10-15 interviews with relevant political actors about the unfolding of the crisis. We hope not only to gather data, but also to establish contacts in the policy-making world to further our aims of writing policy briefs and building international circles of best practice sharing. 

While these outputs are thus far mostly concentrated in the academic sphere, some key exceptions stand out: the Monkey Cage editorial published in the Washington Post had a wide public readership; the website has been launched (https://accountabilityaftereconomiccrisis.com/ ), and we aim to provide information that is of interest and accessible to citizens as well as to public officials and academics; and finally, we held a well-attended public lecture given by the Icelandic Special Prosecutor in early March. This event attracted international journalists, as well as other interested members of the public in addition to students and other academics.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A7C47EFF-55DF-4E13-B52F-262CF3FEF19A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Despite only being one year into the project, we are pleased with our progress thus far. 
The first award objective, the development of a new database (Accounting for the Causes of the Crisis database), is nearly complete. We have completed data collection and organization and need only to upload it to the relevant platform. This data gathering has created significant new knowledge: it is the most comprehensive collection of post-crisis activities to date (indeed, it is the only one known to us). 

Our second award objective, 'to conduct a thorough investigation of how policies of truth and accountability affect political stability using primary data from six countries', has been largely completed with the second phase of research conducted by the local research assistants. We have been very pleased with the scope and quality of data collected by the six research assistants, including the comprehensive reports they have just completed summarizing and analyzing the main institutions implicated in crisis governance, and how their policies affected political stability.

Our third award objective, to conduct fieldwork in six countries, as well as Washington, D.C., and Brussels, through semi-structured interviews with political elites and others, has been thoroughly planned, and will begin in April 2017. We will conclude most of the interviews by early July. Analysis of this data, in conjunction with the interview data that we will collect over the next four months during our fieldwork, will form the basis of our output over the next stages of the project. (We will analyze the interviews using NVIVO software.)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The three final objectives, all relating to scholarly output (papers, policy briefings, organizing and hosting international conferences, and publishing a monograph), will proceed as we analyze the data that we have collected. Thus far, we have made progress developing this output by publishing one co-authored journal article in Political Studies, and by drafting two conceptual papers, one through an invitation from the prestigious Journal of Democracy, and the other having been accepted for presentation at the Council for European Studies conference in July 2017.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8C099768-5545-448E-8908-66E8DD580CDF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Data collection is completed for a comprehensive database of all political, constitutional and economic decisions made in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis in six countries.
