data set, obtained from an experiment, survey, or study. However in
many fields which most urgently demand new statistical methodology,
problems do not fit this paradigm. Instead data are gathered from
multiple settings under different experimental conditions, which may
measure different variables or be sampling from different
populations. This leads to situations in which it is unclear how to
combine statistical information in a way that provides a coherent
solution agreeing with all studies, and which properly quantifies the
uncertainty in the estimation process.

The gold-standard method for answering causal questions is the
randomised controlled trial (RCT), but RCTs are extremely expensive
and usually end without a positive result. Meanwhile biology and
medicine are at the forefront of the big data revolution, as more and
more is being measured at greater and greater resolutions; the 100,000
Genomes Project and UK Biobank each contain tens of thousands of
genetic and phenotypic measurements on hundreds of thousands of
people. Electronic healthcare records will generate Terabytes of
medical information about tens of millions of people. Many of the
quantities measured in these data sets cannot be experimentally
controlled for practical, financial or ethical reasons.

This project aims to uncover how much we can learn about the causal
mechanisms underlying multiple large and complex data sets without
performing experiments, or with limited experimental data: to learn 
as much as possible about the world just by looking.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Causal inference is the very basis of all science: the fields that
will benefit most from any new methodology are epidemiology and
medicine, but also include other areas of genetics and biology,
ecology, sociology, economics, political science, computer science and
robotics. The methods developed in this project will be done so in 
collaboration with industry and academic partners to ensure that
they are practical and applicable to existing problems.

The main impact pathway we envisage is via the development of accurate
uncertainty quantification from complicated experimental designs, and
by enabling much more efficient use of new or existing (cheap)
observational data. The project will directly or indirectly lead to:

* Methods that more efficiently analyse causal relationships from
 various sources of observational or other non-experimental data.
 Ideally this can be augmented with targetted experiments to verify
 the inference; if not the result can be used as part of a larger
 evidence base to demonstrate causation.

* The ability to apply standard statistical techniques to causal
 models with parametric structure.

* Allowing advances in high-dimensional model selection to be used for
 causal inference with 'big data'.

* Experimental designs that provide the maximum possible information
 about causal structure from a limited number of experiments.

The project will make it easier to use existing datasets to propose
plausible causal relationships between, for example, a person's
genome, their lifestyle and other observed characteristics, and health
outcomes. In conjunction with industry partners, we will use this to 
assist in developing software that aids diagnosis of respiratory disease.

As well as indirect impact through greater power for
healthcare researchers to understand the mechanisms of disease, this
can benefit the economy and society directly by leading to new
interventions and influencing public policy.

Other potential applications include

 * the modelling of temporal directed networks in biology or
 sociology;

 * more advanced analysis of large-scale surveys carried out for
 official statistical purposes;

 * new designs for randomised trials, both in medical and in social
 science contexts.

The methods produced will be as accessible as possible so as to
encourage widespread usage outside the statistics community.
Open-source software will allow researchers to make use of and build
upon the new statistical techniques. The project will train a
postdoctoral researcher in the software development.

Finally, our results will reinforce the importance of causal inference
as a discipline, which is fundamental to science as a whole.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99004</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N020294/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
