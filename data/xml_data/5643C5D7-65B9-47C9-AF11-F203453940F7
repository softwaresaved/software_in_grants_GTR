Social cognition is a ?hub? science that bridges the gap between cognitive and social sciences. Researchers in this field examine the foundations of human judgments and behaviour, as well as the reciprocal relationship between the social world and mental processes. Over the last two years, SCONET has provided a platform to support early career scientists, and has contributed to promote social cognition as a research discipline in the UK. This was accomplished through three core initiatives. First, we have organised three colloquia (2009, 2010,&amp;nbsp;and 2011) involving 17 internationally recognised experts from six different countries, as well as 65 PhD students and early career researchers from 27 different institutions in the UK and abroad (Ireland, Germany, France, Netherlands, Australia). In addition, we have provided travel bursaries for 20 PhD students and early career researchers from 13 UK institutions, enabling them to attend four national and six international events. Lastly, we developed a website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socialcognition.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>www.socialcognition.co.uk&lt;/a>) that contains many useful features and offers a platform for exchange between academics, and with non-academic users.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32239</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>University of Kent supports new generation of scientists</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0202F9D2-84CE-4095-AF3D-1AD66139BE65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Media release organised by the University of Kent Press Office.

Examples include:
- Clare Rathbone established collaborations, which led to the development of a new research paradigm to investigate the relationship between the self and memory
- Nicolas Koranyi asserts that he made significant scientific advances as a result of applying his research to a new domain, following the advice of a consulting expert (Fiedler)
- Andrea Paulus has established collaborations with a former PhD student of a consulting expert (Wigboldus).
- MilicaVasiljevic has conducted a study with consulting experts from the US (Sherman) and his PhD students.
- Caroline Leygue is using new priming methods in the domain of energy use. The method was developed during a consultation.
- Dimitrios Xenias is now working on a new MRI project on perceptions of climate change, again stimulated through discussions with experts.
- Saima Noreen is investigating both cognitive and social processes implicated in forgetting, which marks an important advancement in her field. 

SCONET unified social cognition research in the UK and strengthen the field's sense of identity, as evidenced, for example, by the sixty-six UK academics registered on the network website (see http://www.socialcognition.co.uk/persons).

A good example for the contributions to building research capacity is the case of Clare Rathbone. Assisted by a SCONET travel bursary, Clare established a collaboration with a researcher in the US, which led to a successful bid for an ESRC Future Research Leaders Award.

In terms of research tools, the SCONET website (http://www.socialcognition.co.uk/) provides a central repository of frequently updated links, articles and news relevant to research, networking and careers in social cognition. The community also continues to grow, which is evidence of the ongoing positive impact that SCONET has on the field.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>416E3DAE-7123-48FB-8EE7-029AD1282E0B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The UK Social Cognition Network and Training Scheme (SCONET) promotes training, mobility, and networking opportunities for early career social cognition researchers in the UK.
