With the support of government agencies and Research Councils UK, RUSI is eager to build the momentum behind the Strategic Hub to overcome the fragmented knowledge base on organised crime and contribute to policy solutions. 

The increased visibility of organised crime and the recognition of the cost to the UK has resulted in new strategies to respond to criminal activity. The Home Office has developed the Serious and Organised Crime Strategy and established the National Crime Agency. The new strategy takes a holistic approach to organised crime, seeking to Pursue, Prevent, Protect and Prepare. 

Despite renewed energy to combat organised crime, significant knowledge gaps remain. The 2011 Home Office report, 'Future Directions in Organised Crime Research' recognised that the understanding of the scale, impacts, costs and victims of organised crime was inadequate, and an understanding of the individuals engaged in organised crime, including their relationships and the markets they operate within, was lacking. The report pointed to the need to evaluate existing interventions to address organised crime, to develop a better evidence base around drivers, and understand the changing nature of organised crime and future areas of concern. 

Academic research on organised crime has been expanding, which provides an avenue to fill some of these knowledge gaps. Without being driven by a particular policy agenda, academic researchers have the freedom and flexibility to engage with a wide variety of areas, determining which areas are important and warrant further investigation. The emphasis on empirical data provides rich and detailed analysis of how organised crime manifests in different environments, who is involved, and the tensions that arise within organised criminal activity. While organised crime is a growing area of research for academics, much of the research that has emerged is disconnected from the needs of policymakers.

Policy development and scholarly analysis proceed on different tracks. The freedom that underpins academic research can mean that it is disconnected from the needs of policymakers. Instead research may advance theoretical debates which do not enhance responses to organised crime. As a result, there is much to be gained from a dialogue between the two. Academic analysis can improve approaches to organised crime, and provide a deeper understanding of the phenomena, while policymakers and practitioners elucidate problem areas and where further analysis is required, ensuring that academic investigation has a significant impact.

RUSI is well positioned to bridge this gap. With a strong research background and an extensive network of academics working on organised crime, RUSI is engaged in and connected to the growing body of academic research in this area. RUSI also works closely with government agencies addressing organised crime, ensuring a detailed understanding of policy needs.

The Strategic Hub was launched at a conference on 8 December 2014, bringing together policymakers, practitioners and academics to discuss the challenges they face and where further research and analysis is needed. The conference generated an enthusiastic response, and RUSI has created a database of over 200 academics, 65 policymakers and 25 practitioners working on organised crime. This proposal is seeking support to maintain the momentum of the Hub and continue to build the network.

With support from the ESRC, RUSI will build the network and through a series of workshops and other events, transform existing academic research into useful products for policymakers. The Hub also seeks to influence further academic research to ensure it meets policy needs. Additional funding will be sourced from other funders to pursue specific research projects that emerge from the Hub.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Strategic Hub for Organised Crime research aims to build a dialogue between policy development and academic research.

With ESRC support, RUSI will continue to build the Strategic Hub for Organised Crime Research. By identifying and prioritising key research questions that address government knowledge gaps, the Hub aims to make academic research more targeted at policy needs. By improving communication and collaboration between researchers, policymakers and practitioners the Hub will bridge the gap between the different groups ensuring that understandings of organised crime are maximised and targeted at key threats to the UK. The Hub will also enhance public understandings of organised crime and the threat it poses.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147154</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy-maker and Practitioner Workshops</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4058ED15-9597-4ADF-B60B-CC90F5B60706</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Strategic Hub for Organised Crime Research uses workshops as a means to facilitate knowledge exchange between the academic community and policy-makers or practitioners, building relationships between these two communities. The specific objectives are as follows: first, to bring relevant academic research to the attention of those working to tackle organised crime; second, to inform academic researchers of the current knowledge gaps and consequent research requirements of policy-makers and practitioners; and third, where possible, to build research collaborations between these two communities to address that requirement.

In order to achieve these objectives, each workshop focuses on a specific topic, which in 2016, included drugs trafficking, modern slavery and the growing polycriminality of organised crime groups. A consistent format is used at each event: academic speakers are invited to provide insight into current research, while a government or law enforcement speaker outlines current knowledge gaps from a policy or enforcement perspective, and details their request for future research. This presentation is used as the catalyst for a guided discussion about how research could be designed to respond to that requirement (what the research question(s) would be, what data would be required, in what timeframe the work could be conducted etc.)

During the course of 2016, the Strategic Hub hosted four workshops: 

Date: 18th May 2016
Topic: Drugs - Local Trafficking and Distribution in a Transnational Context
Arranged in Partnership with Sussex Police Prospero Knowledge Exchange, University of Bath 

Date: 8th September 2016
Topic: Modern Slavery - Forced Labour
Arranged in Partnership with Sussex Police Prospero Knowledge Exchange, University of Bath 

Date: 8th November 2016 
Topic: Modern Slavery - Forced Labour (Follow-Up)
Arranged in Partnership with Sussex Police Prospero Knowledge Exchange, University of Bath 

Date: 6th December 2016
Topic: Diversifying, Converging and Cooperating - the Changing Nature of Organised Crime Groups

The workshops in 2016 successfully achieved the objectives outlined above, facilitating knowledge exchange between the two communities and directly supporting the development of research collaborations: as detailed in the 'Narrative Impacts' section, one working group and two research projects were developed through these workshops, each including both academic and either policy-maker or practitioner participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital Engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB57C0A3-33CF-4C97-A0F3-1F2E31296610</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In August 2016 the Strategic Hub for Organised Crime Research launched a dedicated website which is intended to promote the work of the Strategic Hub, act as a focal point for members of the network, and provide a platform from which to disseminate resources on organised crime, coordinate events and publicise external funding opportunities.The website includes the following sections:

Library: this is a searchable database of works on organised crime, including academic journals, books, online commentary and policy documents. These have been produced by authors from across the UK and around the globe, and are gathered here to provide a convenient way for practitioners to identify relevant research. Each article is accompanied by full reference details and a link to the original publisher where the text may be accessed. The library remains under development, but already contains information about more than 300 items.

Researchers: academic members of the Strategic Hub network have been invited to submit profiles, which are hosted here in a searchable database, to enable practitioners and policy-makers to easily identify academic experts on specific organised crime topics.

The Informer: this is the blog of the Strategic Hub, and hosts timely commentary and analysis on issues relating to organised crime. It has also been used to promote calls for papers, and during 2017 will be used to promote external research funding opportunities. 

The website is supported by a social media account which has been used to promote the Strategic Hub's work, direct people towards content on the website, and ensure regular public activity to increase our prominence.

In November 2016 the Strategic Hub team began monitoring site analytics, in order to measure the results of our digital engagement. While sufficient data has not yet been gathered for detailed analysis, in the first four months of data gathering the website has received 605 unique visitors. Approximately 49% of visitors found the website through search engines, 20% directly typed the web address into their browser, 17% were referred from links on other sites, and 14% followed links from social media. 

The Strategic Hub's blog, the Informer, has received a particularly high number of views. Moreover, during the course of 2016 blog entries have acted as catalysts for government and law enforcement officials to make contact with the Strategic Hub, asking to join the network or to request further information. 

The digital engagement activities of the Strategic Hub in the latter months of 2016 have therefore achieved some success in relation to their stated objectives, specifically, in promoting the work of the Strategic Hub, and providing a platform from which to disseminate resources on organised crime.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://shoc.rusi.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The central aim of the Strategic Hub for Organised Crime Research is to bridge the gap between policy development and academic research. While it is too soon to identify specific law enforcement strategies or government policies that have benefited from the activities of the Strategic Hub, through our initial activities we have been able to identify emerging societal impact.

As described in the 'Engagement Activities' section, the Strategic Hub uses workshops as a means to facilitate knowledge exchange and build relationships between the policy-maker/practitioner and academic communities. Through the workshops in 2016, members of the academic community have received briefings from government and law enforcement officials about their research requirements; those officials have received briefings from academia on relevant research that may support their work in tackling organised crime; and specific research collaborations have developed between these two communities. The following offers more specific evidence of the consequent emerging impact:

Working Group: as a result of discussions at the 'Drugs Trafficking' workshop, a working group has been established including law enforcement practitioners from a Regional Organised Crime Unit and academic researchers from three UK universities. The purpose is to facilitate data sharing and to develop specific collaborative projects in relation to drugs trafficking.

Project One: as a result of discussions at the 'Modern Slavery' workshops, a pilot project has been established between the University of Sussex and the Home Office, and research funding obtained.

Project Two: as a result of discussions at the 'Modern Slavery' workshops, a proof of concept project has been developed by the University of Sussex and Sussex Police, and research funding obtained.

(Due to the nature of the working group and these two projects, further details cannot be shared in a public forum at this stage, but may be provided directly to ESRC on request).

Societal impact is therefore emerging from Strategic Hub workshops, through the support offered to government and law enforcement officials working to tackle organised crime: the presentations from academic speakers have brought relevant research to their attention, while the collaborations developed through the workshops (the working group and projects described above) are enabling them to inform the focus of specific academic work and subsequently to benefit from its insights. 

Further workshops will be held throughout 2017, with the objective of building further collaborations in this manner.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>74B955E5-4856-4D94-98EC-D78811813D69</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N018494/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
