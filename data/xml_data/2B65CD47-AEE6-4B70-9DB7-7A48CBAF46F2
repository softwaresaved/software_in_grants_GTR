This unique and innovative international cross-disciplinary network will explore the use of tracking devices in a number of domains including their use with offenders, mental health patients, young people in care and dementia patients. In most of these settings the use of tracking devices is controversial and has resulted in significant academic and public debate. Concerns centre on privacy, ethics, data protection, efficiency, effectiveness, the efficacy and suitability of the equipment design, the involvement of the private sector as providers and operators as well as the potential for discriminatory use. Despite high levels of disquiet, governance and regulatory structures lag behind the capabilities and applications of the tracking technologies. 
Exploring the use of tracking devices in a variety of settings and across jurisdictions will highlight synergies and discontinuities in the implementation, debates and challenges surrounding its current and future use. The network will result in new empirical, conceptual and theoretical insights into the use of tracking devices creating a greater appreciation of the legal, social, ethical and technical issues arising from their use. It will also facilitate the sharing of technical and methodological knowledge and skills across domains and set out an inter-disciplinary research agenda for the future. 
The network will be led by a cross-disciplinary team at the University of Leeds and involved academic and research users primarily from the UK and Europe. The network will comprise: academics and postgraduate and early career researchers from the arts, social and medical sciences, engineering, and product design; policy-makers and practitioners from criminal justice, health, immigration and education from the UK and Europe; voluntary sector organisations; and private companies involved in the design, manufacturing and operation of tracking devices. The network will be unique in bringing together experts from a range of domains and jurisdictions to examine the applications of a single, under-researched technology from multiple disciplinary perspectives. It will lead to new and better shared knowledge, understandings and insights via exposure to the challenges and opportunities faced in each setting.
The network will encourage cross-disciplinary research, build research capacity and seek to contribute to evidence-based policy making. It will strive to influence legal and policy development so that it is able to keep better pace with technological advances. It will seek to inform the technological development of tracking devices so that greater attention is paid to ethical and social concerns in their design. It will also better inform arts and social and medical sciences academics, policy-makers and practitioners about the technical limitations of tracking technologies resulting in a greater understanding of the potential and boundaries of these devices.
The network will develop over a period of 18 months through a series of four events which will culminate in a final conference. A series of briefing papers will be published as well as an edited collection, articles placed in academic and practitioner journals and papers delivered at conferences. The network will reach a wide audience beyond event participants via a bespoke website, blogs and Twitter. The intention is for the network to continue after the funding has ceased and for members to collaborate on future research projects and events.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The use of tracking technologies is increasing common in a number domains including criminal justice, mental health, primary care and with children and is likely to expand further in the future in terms of both numbers and uses. Yet the governance and regulatory frameworks surrounding the use of tracking technologies lag significantly behind its practical use in an increasing number of domains, often being introduced on an ad hoc basis or as part of small pilot projects. The network will provide a forum for discussion of increasingly urgent questions facing policy makers and practitioners about how best to use these emerging technologies to bring advantages to society (greater individual and public safety, reduced offending etc.) whilst safeguarding the rights of individuals. The network and associated events will bring together academics and research users from different domains and jurisdictions to discuss the deployment of tracking technologies in a variety of settings and explore synergies and discontinuities between sectors. The network events will be inclusive and involve a wide range of beneficiaries from outside of academia including:
European institutions including Council of Europe, European Commission DG Justice, Health and Food Safety and Research and Innovation; Government departments in the UK and Europe, Statutory sector agencies and organisations (National Probation Service, Community Rehabilitation Companies, police forces, Youth Offending Services, NHS England and Health and Social Care Information Centre, hospitals and secure units); Professional associations (National Police Chief's Council, College of Policing, and the Confederation of European Probation (CEP), Royal College of Physicians); National voluntary sector organisations (VSOs) (Howard League, Liberty, Mind, Age UK, Dementia UK, Dementia Action Alliance, Alzheimer's Society, the Family Rights Group and Victim Support); Local VSOs (Leeds Older people's Forum, Dementia Friendly Leeds and Carers Leeds); Private sector technology companies and consultants involved in the design, manufacture and deployment of tracking devices. 
The inclusion of policy-makers, practitioners and technology providers and designers will bring immediate benefits in that participation will present an opportunity to reflect upon the current situation and practices and to explore and discuss alternative perspectives. It will also provide an opportunity for informed strategic thinking amongst all participants. For the research community the events will bring immediate benefits in terms of an appreciation of current knowledge and gaps, consideration of appropriate methodologies and provide an opportunity for strategic thinking about future research agendas and priorities. Moreover, it will present opportunities to identify future research and collaborative projects amongst members. It is envisaged that the network will be agenda setting in terms of policy, practice and research. 
The main themes of the network's events will be disseminated to a wide audience beyond its participants. The network will have a dedicated website on which presentations and a summary of the discussions will be posted. The network website, blog and Twitter accounts will be utilised to publicise the network, disseminate on-going findings and conclusions and to publicise events therefore sustaining engagement from research users during and after the network events. In addition the following knowledge exchange activities will take place to ensure the highest level of potential impact on research users:
i. A series of briefing papers tailored to particular audiences summarising the main themes of each event will be published. 
ii. An edited collection will be published reflecting the cross-disciplinary aims of the network. 
iii. Articles will be published in a range of relevant practitioner journals. 
iv. Invitations will be sought to present the network's findings at practitioner conferenc</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35994</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scoping the landscape and debates across domains</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5EEAEAFC-3010-4226-95C4-02D37E9A0B42</gtr:id><gtr:impact>52 individuals attended an event organised to examine the current landscape and debates in the use of tracking devices across a range of domains.
