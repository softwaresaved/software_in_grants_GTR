Biologists routinely use microscopes to understand the way that cells combine to form tissue. However, as the tissue being grown within the laboratory becomes thicker (2mm-1cm) then conventional microscopes cannot be used. The reason for this is that light is heavily scattered by tissue (this is the reason that you can't see the bone in your finger when you hold it up to a light bulb). New imaging methods therefore need to be developed to allow imaging of thick tissue using light. Ultrasound is a method that is routinely used in medicine for imaging thick tissue and is very useful for measuring the mechanical structure of tissue. However it cannot obtain the same functional information that can be obtained using light. For example, light can be used to detect the fluorescence of cells or the oxygen content of the blood. Within this project we will develop a new device that combines light and ultrasound to image thick tissue. This new device will provide the functional information of light at the image resolution of ultrasound. The device is based on the principle that when light passes through ultrasound it becomes modulated at the frequency of the ultrasound. This allows one to use ultrasound to place a flashing beacon of light within the tissue at a precise location and provides a method of working out where the light has been within the tissue. Moving the focus of the ultrasound to different locations within the tissue (as would be done in conventional ultrasound imaging) allows one to build up an image of light within the tissue at the resolution of ultrasound. There are several technical challenges to developing such a device as the interaction between light and sound within tissue is very weak and hence the modulated light signals emerging from the tissue are very weak. The group has expertise in light interaction with tissue, the design of medical instruments and ultrasound and we will combine this expertise to increase the size of the light signal emerging from tissue and make the light detection as sensitive as possible. One example is to use more than one source of ultrasound and interfere the ultrasound waves to provide larger light signals and better resolution. In addition we will use computer simulations to model the way light propagates through tissue and interacts with the ultrasound. This will help us understand the best way to position the ultrasound sources and light detectors to achieve the best performance. The engineers and biologists will work closely together during the project to ensure that we are constructing a useful device. Experiments will be performed to image fluorescent signals within tissue at the resolution of ultrasound during the project. The main aims can be summarised as follows; 1) Development a system combining light and ultrasound to obtain images of light within tissue at the resolution of ultrasound. 2) Use novel ultrasound methods to make the light signals emerging from the tissue as large as possible. 3) Obtain the first images of fluorescence at high resolution within thick tissue 4) Simultaneously measure the original light colour and the fluorescence within tissue. The new device will provide an important new tool for tissue engineers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A new imaging system combining the resolution of ultrasound with the functional information of optics will be developed. In tissue engineering, samples that are being grown are increasing in size and this makes it impossible for them to be imaged using conventional optical microscopy. New approaches are therefore necessary to image tissue function. The new system will use ultrasound to modulate light that passes through the focus, allowing the effects of scattering to be overcome. This will allow fluorescence to be imaged within thick tissue (~1cm) in 3D, at high resolution (better than 100 microns) and will provide a valuable new tool for tissue engineers. The novelty of this research is; 1) Development of an ultrasound modulated optical tomography system to image fluorescence within thick tissue at high resolution. 2) The use of non-linear acoustic techniques to maximize signal to noise ratio and resolution. 3) Demonstration of the first 3D, high resolution, fluorescence images of thick tissue in tissue engineering 4) Simultaneously mapping excitation and emission wavelengths that enables the quantitative mapping of absorption and fluorescence properties of the tissue Within this project the system will be used to image fluorescently labeled tissue but if successful the approach could also be applied to imaging bioluminescence, fluorescence lifetime imaging and imaging the response of nanosensors embedded within tissue and scaffolds.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252624</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>109842</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Demonstrating the commercial potential of ultrasonically modulated optical tomography (USMOT)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/F004923/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6419BD34-CFB9-4E03-B40B-406478EC5EEB</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Acoustic microscopy is now being used to characterise indusrial powders</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FB6882C2-6932-4526-829A-C6D227FDF0E6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have demonstrated that the amplitude of the detected acousto-optic signal depends on size of the fluorescent target and the acoustic frequency and that this is potentially useful when probing fluorescent targets. Speckle demodulation algorithms have been extended to allow their application with pulsed ultrasound.



We have developed two models of light propagation. The first is a relatively simple model in which the acoustic focal zone is modeled as a series of layers from which an optical pulse is excited. The model predicts the trends of the experiments well and is used as the basis of our maximum likelihood reconstruction algorithm. The second model is based on a Monte Carlo simulation in which individual photons propagate via a random walk through the scattering medium and interact with the acoustic focal zone. 

We have carried out a detailed characterization of PLA and PLGA scaffolds, including methods of wetting the (hydrophobic) scaffold. For successful acoustic propagation through the scaffold it is essential to saturate the foam with fluid and remove highly-scattering gas pockets. However, permeation of such scaffolds is challenging due to their hydrophobicity, tortuous pore network, capillary resistance and closed pores. To overcome hydrophobicity we use ethanol as a wetting agent, before dilution in water.

Scaffolds are immersed in 5 cm of ethanol surrounded by an ice bath. The chilled environment is necessary since ethanol lowers the glass transition temperature of the polymer from around 40oC to 10oC. We consider the scaffold saturation under immersion only, and then with the addition of a high-intensity sonotrode (Hielscher UP100H). 



The presence of high intensity ultrasound dramatically increases the rate and overall level of permeation. We achieve 100% filling of the pore space (to the accuracy of our measurements) within 2 hours. This improvement is thought to arise from the promotion of diffusion and transport through tortuous networks provided by the agitated fluid. It remains possible that the sonication may be permanently disrupting and exposing the pore architecture, as observed elsewhere. However, our results are repeatable and we find no detectable mass loss following sonication, which suggest that such structural modifications are insignificant.



We have also determined the speed of sound and for the first time, the glass transition in the PLGLA scaffold using scanning acoustic microscopy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In tissue engineering, samples that are being grown are increasing in size and this makes it impossible for them to be imaged using conventional optical microscopy. New approaches are therefore necessary to image tissue function. The new system will use ultrasound to modulate light that passes through the focus, allowing the effects of scattering to be overcome. To this end we have developed three high spatial resolution 3D imaging systems during this project. The first extends the work previously carried out at the University of Leeds in acoustic microscopy which allows high spatial resolution (20 &amp;micro;m) imaging of 3D constructs. This has been used to characterise the properties of porous PLA and PLGA tissue scaffolds. Through additional follow on funding from BBSRC, the system has been developed into a robust demonstrator and an industrial partner is helping the University of Leeds to realise its commercial potential. Three systems have been developed within this project, which all have the potential to be useful tools for tissue engineers. The first is a purely acoustic system which has been used to characterise the properties of porous tissue scaffolds. The second has used pulsed ultrasound to image fluorescent objects embedded in gel scaffolds. This is the first time pulsed ultrasound has been used to image fluorescence and it offers the potential for high resolution, high peak power imaging.



The final system has developed a new method of carrying out nonlinear imaging known as pulse inversion ultrasound modulated optical tomography. Nonlinear effects only occur when the ultrasound pressure is relatively high and so they are localised at the focus. By imaging the non-linear (second harmonic in this case) we have improved the imaging resolution by a factor of 1.7 allowing smaller objects to be resolved.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>077A3E38-5F37-48B7-943C-7A9823EB49A7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5D9F0675-7A90-4C7E-8275-78FB66F76B4F"><gtr:id>5D9F0675-7A90-4C7E-8275-78FB66F76B4F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ultrasound modulated imaging of luminescence generated within a scattering medium.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of biomedical optics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/061eaba9dc07d0dec0b64789bb8fef9f"><gtr:id>061eaba9dc07d0dec0b64789bb8fef9f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Huynh NT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1083-3668</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/206A57E6-F51F-4AD2-9100-9ED906F59062"><gtr:id>206A57E6-F51F-4AD2-9100-9ED906F59062</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pulsed ultrasound modulated optical tomography with harmonic lock-in holography detection.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Optical Society of America.
