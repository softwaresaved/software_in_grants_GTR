These strategically important networks are vulnerable to fast-moving seafloor flows of sediment, known as turbidity currents. Such flows have previously broken important subsea cable connections; leading to &amp;pound;Ms in lost financial trading and repair costs. The seafloor cable network transfers &amp;gt;95% of all global communications traffic. The International Cable Protection Committee (represented by partner Carter) has a vested interest in understanding the risk of turbidity currents, but there is a paucity of direct field measurements of turbidity currents. Thus, numerical models are largely based on scaled down experimental studies. Here, we show how the first deep-ocean high resolution measurements of turbidity currents can enable improved understanding of the risk posed, through calibration of numerical models for impact analysis. This will directly benefit partners Chevron and Shell, who are responsible for ensuring safe operation of multi-&amp;pound;M seafloor oil and gas pipelines worldwide. Loss of hydrocarbons to the environment can have severe environmental and reputational implications; hence minimising the risk of a pipe rupture is important. Improvements to modelling will be immediately taken up by partner HR Wallingford, who advise a wide range of owners and stakeholders on hazard assessment for seafloor infrastructure. 

We aim to address the following questions: 
[1] How can emerging direct monitoring technology lead to a step-change in assessment of turbidity current risk to offshore infrastructure? Until recently, there were no direct measurements of turbidity currents due to the difficulties in deployment in remote and challenging subsea environments. New advances in technology have enabled the first measurements of velocity and concentration in deep-ocean turbidity currents. Techniques developed for, and lessons lrned from, the monitoring of flows at a number of sites will be transferred to industry partners. This first aim is thus to help improve how industry assesses turbidity current hazards by using the first ever direct measurements. 

[2] How appropriate are existing models and how should they be revised based on new field-scale calibrations? As no comparable datasets exist, this new direct monitoring provides a unique opportunity to validate, test and refine numerical models of turbidity current. We will first assess how appropriate existing flows employed by industry are at recreating real flow behaviour. We will then run variants of a depth-resolved model developed by Dorrell. The aim is to provide a modelling approach that is acceptable in terms of computational cost, and that can recreate observations from direct monitoring. Specific guidance will be provided to the partners on how models should be developed to assess impact of turbidity currents on seafloor infrastructure. 

[3] What impact do real-world turbidity currents have on seafloor infrastructure? We will then quantify turbidity current impact on a range of seafloor infrastructure. This is novel because it will involve the application of new models based on the first deep-sea direct monitoring data. The analysis will transform industry understanding of impacts and mitigation strategies. 

Deliverables will include: (i) Report outlining industry best practice for turbidity current hazard assessment; (ii) New numerical modelling approach outlined in a workshop; (iii) Summary report detailing the modelled impacts of real-world turbidity currents on a range of seafloor infrastructure, and guidance for design, mitigation measures and future data acquisition strategies. 

Project cost = &amp;pound;87.2k (at 80% FEC) over 12 months.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As such real-world calibration of numerical models for impact assessment has not before been performed, this project will provide the first guidance to a wide range of infrastructure companies, on how to measure, monitor and quantify turbidity current risk. The project outputs will thus be directly transferable to industry needs. They are as follows:

Contribute to defining industry best practice for turbidity current hazard assessment: Project partners Chevron and Shell are responsible for assessing the risk posed to seafloor structures at a number of deep-water sites worldwide with a view to identifying safe and efficient layouts and routes for infrastructure. They are faced with making important decisions on the viability of different infrastructure configurations, often at very early stages in a project. Presently, this assessment is largely done based on qualitative interpretation of seafloor data and the inferences of past flow properties based on analysis of sediment cores. We will provide a summary of new tools that our partners can use to make direct measurements of active turbidity currents to quantify their impact for the first time. 

New numerical modelling approach for turbidity currents: Project partners HR Wallingford, Chevron, and Shell use numerical models to understand the impact of turbidity currents on seafloor infrastructure. They also use such models to build oil and gas reservoir characterisation models; ancient turbidity current deposits form many of the important hydrocarbon reservoirs worldwide. As these models are currently based on calibration from scaled-down experiments, and the deposits of past flows, the use of state-of-the-art scientific models calibrated by direct field measurements, as offered by this project, will enable a valuable step-forward for industry. Importantly, the project will include a test of the numerical models that are currently used to determine their applicability and provide confidence in future assessments. 

Guidance for mitigation of turbidity current hazard: The final output will be immediately transferable to the International Cable Protection Committee to understand what impacts real-world flows have on the global network of subsea telecommunication cables that underpin our day to day lives. Guidance will be used for future cable routes, such as where expected pinch-points might be and where optimal canyon crossings could be located. Currently cable companies rely on past records of cable breaks, with unclear guidance on how and where new cables should be laid. We aim to provide more robust guidance based on the calibrated modelling of impact. Partners Chevron and Shell will use the guidance to improve confidence in decision-making concerning field layout design and the routing of export pipelines and to minimise the potential for damaged infrastructure, lost production, and negative environmental consequences. Partner HR Wallingford will immediately use such information for infrastructure geohazard assessments, advising operators, contractors &amp;amp; stakeholders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>119810</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P009190/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF2ECBC3-83AC-4763-B527-27A84805F0F9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE94F009-26A1-4E5B-B0B3-722A355F282C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geohazards</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5537B6B2-9FD6-40FB-B300-64555528D3FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sediment/Sedimentary Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
