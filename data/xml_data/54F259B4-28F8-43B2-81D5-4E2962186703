In Britain, as in some other jurisdictions, austerity measures have prompted consideration of previously unpalatable proposals to outsource aspects of policing to the private sector and foster innovations in public-private partnerships. Governments have been prompted to reassess the police mission and workforce, look for new sources of revenue, consider outsourcing to private providers and engage citizens and civil society organisations in new ways. The British Government has moved further and faster than most, making clear its ideological commitment to greater private sector involvement in the delivery of policing.
Developments in the UK have been marked by the absence of rigorous debate about the implications of and limits to greater private sector involvement in public policing. Many commentators agree that there are some 'core' areas of policing that the private sector should not take away from the police. However, here is little agreement about what this core constitutes, what differentiates it from other aspects of policing, what the limits to private sector involvement should be or the principles upon which outsourcing should operate. There has been a distinct lack of public discussion, limited scrutiny of outsourcing initiatives and an absence of systematic academic, practitioner and policy deliberation reflecting on insights from research, as well as comparative experiences across the globe. There has been insufficient engagement with the lessons of outsourcing in other areas of public service delivery, the value of public goods and the wider philosophical debates about the limits and effects of markets. Consequently, there are evident risks that, in Britain at least, outsourcing of key aspects of police work may unfold in an ad-hoc and unprincipled manner. 
This seminar series fills this void by stimulating an evidence-based and principled debate among policy-makers, senior practitioners and academics about the appetite for, and limits to, private sector involvement in public policing. It will bring together key representatives of different interests and organisations to explore the parameters and regulation of markets in policing. The core group of participants to the full series include: senior police managers; Police and Crime Commissioners; national police bodies; rank-and-file police officers; private security firms; security industry associations and regulators; policy think-tanks; established policing scholars; early career researchers and PhD students. It will stimulate a debate which is grounded in research evidence, normative principles and insights from practice in the UK and beyond.
Seminars will be structured in such a way as to explore the politics of market reforms, the moral parameters and principles of income generation schemes and private sector involvement in police-work and the regulation of the markets in policing. It will also consider public-private developments in a number of specified areas of policing including public order, mass events, police custody, cyber-crime and the internet, the night-time economy and neighbourhood patrols. Whilst primarily focused on British policy innovations, the series will seek to locate these in a wider international and cross-cultural context. It will benefit from consideration of analogous developments and debates in a number of European countries as well as North America and learn from leading international scholars. Reciprocally, the series will seek to inform international understanding. Key deliberations and debates will be open to wider audiences via video-link and webinars. The series will actively engage the media and seek to encourage public discussion by disseminating its findings and conclusions via a policy briefing with recommendations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit: The non-academic beneficiaries include those who will be directly involved as members of the core group throughout the series: Ron Hogg, Durham Police and Crime Commissioner; Fraser Sampson, Chief Executive of the Office of the West Yorkshire PCC; Nick Gargan, Chief Constable, Avon &amp;amp; Somerset Constabulary and ACPO lead for Finance and Resources; John Shaw, Managing Director of G4S Policing Support Services; James Kelly, Chief Executive, British Security Industry Association; Zoe Billingham, Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary; Imogen Hayat, Stakeholder &amp;amp; Media Relations Manager, Security Industry Authority; Baroness Ruth Henig, ex-SIA Chair and Adviser to the BSIA; Nancie Shackleton, Commercial Partnership Manager, Lincolnshire Police; John Graham, Director of the Police Foundation; Rick Muir, Associate Director for Public Services, Institute for Public Policy Research; Max Chambers, Head of Crime and Justice, Policy Exchange; Martin Gill, Director of Perpetuity Research &amp;amp; Consultancy International; Ben Priestley, National Officer for Police and Justice, UNISON; Syreeta Lund, Editor of the Police Federation Magazine, Police Federation. If any of the above is unable to attend a particular seminar they will be encouraged to send a deputy from their organisation. Other direct beneficiaries will be those research users who will be invited to a number of the seminars include representatives of the following national organisations: Home Office; College of Policing; Independent Police Complaints Commission; National Audit Office; senior police managers from police forces across England and Wales. In addition, international non-academic beneficiaries will include CEPOL - the European Police College, the European Forum on Urban Security (EFUS), and the Confederation of European Security Services (CoESS). These key pan-European organisations will be enlisted to help disseminate the work and conclusions of the project.
How will they benefit: This proposal arises out of discussions with senior police managers, PCCs and partner organisations some of which have been organised around co-production activities of the N8 Policing Research Partnership. It has involved non-academic beneficiaries and users from the outset in the development stages of the proposal design, as named Co-Investigators, in the oversight and management of the seminar series, in the core group of participants and contributors, as well as in the dissemination and impact of the series and its conclusions. It is expected that core group members will highlight the deliberations and findings of the seminar series more widely within their organisation and how interested non-academics can find out more about the series and its activities via the website. Where appropriate, video-links and webinars will be used to enhance the dissemination of the seminar deliberations to a wider audience.
The project will provide a structured and developmental conversation between the core group members over the three year lifespan of the series, thus engaging key non-academic commentators on the future of policing in practitioner-researcher network of engagement and knowledge exchange. It will culminate in the final seminar out of which a policy briefing report will be produced with recommendations. This will be written in an accessible format for wide dissemination among non-academic beneficiaries. All non-academic core group members will constitute an Advisory Board with which the Steering Group (of PI and Co-Is) will consult regularly throughout; with email updates, requests for feedback and identifying opportunities for possible research collaboration. It is anticipated that the series will provide excellent opportunities for co-production of future research projects allied to the themes of the seminars. Dedicated time will be given towards the end of each seminar to a discussion of possible research themes, agendas and questions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60472</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Politics of Market Reform in Policing, seminar (LSE, London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D7542FEC-3FCD-4C1D-95C1-E1D399239A53</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One day seminar and debate including:
