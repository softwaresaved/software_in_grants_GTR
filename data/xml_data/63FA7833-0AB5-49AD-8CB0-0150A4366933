Some of these processes are mediated by signalling pathways that alert the cell to a threat and initiate a response. Interferon mediated pathways are essential for cell defence. The NF-kB pathway is linked to inflammation and specifically to chronic inflammatory bowel disease in humans. These pathways can be influenced by a range of &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; molecules and the study of how such compounds can activate or moderate these pathways is of considerable interest in the context of understanding them more thoroughly and with the development of new therapies for a range of viral and inflammatory diseases. 

The vioprolides are a group of modified cyclic peptides isolated from a myxobacterium that have been shown to have a synergystic activating effect on an interferon mediated pathway in cells and a moderating effect on the NF-kB pathway. Unfortunately the quantities of vioprolides that are available from the natural source are very limited indeed and are restricting further studies into the biological effects of these compounds. 

It is proposed to develop syntheses of these vioprolides from simpler commercially available compounds so that the biological studies can be resumed. Moreover once these syntheses are complete, it should be possible to modify them to provide analogues of the naturally occurring compounds in order to study aspects of the effects of structural changes on the biological activities of these compounds. 

These syntheses will be challenging in themselves although by using a convergent approach it is hoped that the longest linear route will be no more than 20 steps long. The syntheses will not be straight forward since embedded within the structures of the vioprolides are features that made them very sensitive to certain chemical reagents. However, based on preliminary studies an approach to these compounds has been put forward and will be the basis of the work to be carried out with the support of this grant. 

Finally, it should be noted that the vioprolides are active at the nanogramme level. So the synthesis of tens of milligramme quantities should provide enough material for biological studies to continue although it it hoped to prepare at least one vioprolide on a hundred milligramme scale.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The vioprolides are complex compounds that have yet to be synthesized. The synthetic work will therefore be extremely challenging and will be publishable in international journals of chemistry, so contributing to the reputation of UK organic chemistry. The PI will also present the work at international conferences of organic chemistry. 

Th work will also test synthetic methodologies that provide access to cyclic depsipeptides and cognate structures to the limit and will deliver an excellent training for the post-doctoral researchers involved. 

Improved understanding and control of cellular responses to viral and bacterial infections will aid the development of new medical therapies. The interferon pathway is an important process by which cells respond to infection. Indeed recombinant human alpha-interferons are used for the treatment of several diseases whilst a beta-interferon is certified for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. An understanding of the mechanistic basis of the synergistic effect of vioprolides on the murine type 1 interferon signalling pathway will lead to better appreciation of crucial IFN signalling processes. This improved understanding of the IFN pathways will contribute to the development of improved therapies for viral diseases and cancer. The NF-kB pathway is linked to chronic inflammatory bowel disease in humans. The systems biology of the NF-kB pathway is being studied to improve the understanding of inflammatory bowel disease. It has been shown that vioprolide A modulates the NF-kB pathway but further work using other vioprolides and analogues is urgently required. This work will make available samples of vioprolides that will be evaluated for their effects on the activation and moderation of signalling pathways in cells with the interferon mediated pathways and the NF-kB pathway being of immediate interest. This will impact on our understanding of these pathways and how they can be controlled. 

The study of the cell signalling pathways will contribute to the development of improved therapies for intractable diseases. By providing vioprolides for further studies, the work outlined in this proposal may help to lead to the development of new therapies and their consequent contribution to the prosperity and success of the UK pharmaceuticals industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>379217</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The impact of the work will only be assessed at the end of the award. To date an advanced macrocyclic intermediate with all of the constituent amino quids and glyceric acid in place has been successfully prepared and we are now looking at the final stages of the synthesis. The unknown quantities here are concerned with the introduction of one particular feature, the (E)-dehydrobutyrine. Although we have checked procedures for this crucial aspect of the work using simpler model systems, there is uncertainty about the introduction of this moiety at the particular site it appears to be in the vioprolides. There are also associated issues about protecting groups, that is groups used to conceal reactive functionalities until they can be released at the end of the synthesis. 
The structures assigned to the vioprolides by the original authors were assigned on the basis of spectroscopic data and analysis of the constituent amino acids. If our synthesis is completed, it will be the first time that these structural assignments will be checked. Based on what we have leant during our synthetic studies, we are more than a little concerned about the (E)-assignment made to the dehydrobutyrine fragment and so it will an important outcome of the work if we can complete a synthesis of a vioprolide and so confirm (or disprove) the original structural assignments for these compounds. 
Notwithstanding this outcome, our work to date will amount to a significant contribution to the field that will definitely be publishable in international peer-reviewed chemical journals. If the synthesis is completed, then not only will the chemistry be published, but the synthetic material will be made available to our biological collaborators. At present this outcome is on a knife-edge.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are making good progress with the chemistry and our novel findings will help other synthetic chemists. However we need to finish the syntheses before we can give material to our colleagues in life sciences. Hopefully we will complete a synthesis of vioprolide D which is the biologically most active member of the series and so the most interesting but it is unlikely that we will prepare vioprolide A as we will not have time to prepare the azetidinyl amino acid. This was a conscious decision since we decided to develop the synthetic strategy first and chose vioprolide D as the initial target as its constituent amino acids are commercially available. I am still confident that this was the right decision but the early biological studies were carried out using vioprolide A and so even though D is the more active we would have liked to have prepared A as well for continuity. On the positive side, bringing material through is not an issue and if we can solve the remaining issues we should be able to give our life sciences colleagues samples on a scale of use to them.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>04B8A0C3-83E5-43F7-9CAC-A9B3845D60F2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L012898/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B9701E7-D17F-4963-82DA-B3926A65B50A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological &amp; Medicinal Chem.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
