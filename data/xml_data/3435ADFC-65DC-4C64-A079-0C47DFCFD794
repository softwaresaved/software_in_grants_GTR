In many cases, this vector is an insect that transmits the disease causing agent when it feeds. Transmission dynamics of these vector-borne diseases are very complex and difficult to predict. One area that has not been well studied is the effect of vector behaviour on transmission cycles. Specifically, we understand very little about how behaviour varies across vector life span, between individuals in a population, and in response to environmental variation. A better understanding of vector behaviour and how it effects disease transmission would improve our understanding of vector-borne disease dynamics, lead to more targeted models, and eventually to better informed disease control and policies. 

The Vector Behavior in Transmission Ecology Research Coordination Network (VectorBiTE RCN) will facilitate investigation into the role of vector behaviour and life history in disease transmission dynamics. This US-UK collaborative network aims to accomplish this goal by promoting (1) the development of theoretical models that include more details of vector behaviour and heterogeneity; (2) improved data collection and statistical methods to enable such models to be confronted with data; (3) development of comprehensive and freely available validation datasets to allow testing of methods and comparison between proposed models in a transparent fashion; and (4) training of young researchers in these new tools and methods as they are developed. These objectives will be accomplished through: (A) annual meetings and workshops to bring together empirical and theoretical biologists across diverse systems and institutions; (B) the development of an online platform which will include repositories for data on vector behaviour and code for modelling the role of behaviour on transmission dynamics; and (C) providing opportunities to educate fellow researchers and the public about network advances via online and conference presentations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Many medically and economically important pathogens are spread by insect vectors. Vector-borne disease transmission is remarkably complex because interactions between pathogens, vectors, hosts, and their physical environment dictate dynamics. The biology of disease vectors has historically been studied in the context of control, leaving many aspects of the basic biology, especially behavior and life history, of these animals relatively ignored. Over the last several decades there has been a resurgence of interest in the biology of vectors, including how their behavior influences disease transmission dynamics. The emerging data have begun to provide new insights and have highlighted the potential importance of variation of vector behaviors and life history traits (1) across individual lifespan, (2) among individuals within populations, and (3) in response to environmental variation transmission dynamics. 

The Vector Behavior in Transmission Ecology Research Coordination Network (VectorBiTE RCN) will facilitate investigation into the role of vector behaviour and life history in disease transmission dynamics. This US-UK collaborative network aims to accomplish this goal by promoting (1) the development of theoretical models that include more details of vector behaviour and heterogeneity; (2) improved data collection and statistical methods to enable such models to be confronted with data; (3) development of comprehensive and freely available validation datasets to allow testing of methods and comparison between proposed models in a transparent fashion; and (4) training of young researchers in these new tools and methods as they are developed.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Researchers in the field of disease ecology: The RCN will result in an open access online database containing standardized data on vector behaviour and life history, along with code for modelling the impact of these on transmission. These resources together with other information will be made freely available to the disease ecology community. Ideally, these resources will be used to assess potential control strategies and lead to a better understanding of vector borne disease dynamics. 

Early Career Scientists: Training early career scientists is a key component of this RCN. This includes workshops in years 3 and 4 targeted at early career investigators. These trainees will include early career scientists from underrepresented groups and regions. 

Interested Public: Educational materials, including videos of presentations on vector borne diseases and training materials developed for the workshops, will shared on an open access website that will be built as part of this RCN.

This project has potential to contribute to the health and wealth of the nation by providing training in quantitative modelling to new researchers, creating new methods for assessing the risk and potential control of vector borne disease, and create new collaborations between the UK and USA researchers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>404073</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Pint of Science</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB95862B-5BB6-473A-B003-DB6F766CDD01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr. Cator gave a presentation on the importance of mosquito ecology for understanding and controlling mosquito transmitted diseases as part of the international &amp;quot;Pint of Science&amp;quot; festival.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://pintofscience.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bugs Day 2016!</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FED0C48A-FD0A-4E46-80A8-0334DD43D2E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Cator lab members put on a &amp;quot;Build a Mosquito!&amp;quot; booth at campus open day.

Towards this goal we have:

Held the first meeting of the RCN -- VectorBiTE 2016 -- was held March 23--25 2016 at the Collaborative Labs in Clearwater, FL. - At this meeting we were able to bring together 52 researchers. This included 29 early career (post doc or graduate student participants). These attendees have formed 8 working groups that continue to interact. These groups are working on meta-analyses, new models, and in some cases grant applications.
1. Species Interactions and Transmission (SpIT!) (13 members)
2. Variation in functional traits across age and stage (6 members)
3. FutureBites: Predicting associations among hosts, parasites, and vectors (10 members)
4.Toward a Better Understanding of EIP (4 members)
5. Environmental Influences Across Stages (9 members)
6. Insecticide Resistance (10 members)
7. Varying Environmental Drivers and Size-related Traits (12 members)

Launched a virtual presences online (ww.vectorbite.org) this website has over 200 users with function profiles and ability to virtually join working groups.
We had proposed to build two global databases: one for trait (including behavior and life history) variation (VecTrait), and another for spatially- and temporally- explicit population presence-absence abundance, density and dynamics data (VecDyn). Database activities are primarily funded through the UK portion of the project. These databases will be accompanied by web applications / interfaces for querying, downloading, and uploading data. To this end, following the VectorBiTE 2016 meeting discussions, we:

Have hired a 1/2-time Research Assistant based at Imperial College who is in charge of developing and maintaining the relational databases and web interfaces to them.
Have assembled a core VectorBiTE Ecoinformatics working group that will lead the data collation and database development effort. 
Have developed separate data entry templates for VecDyn and VecTrait, with field definitions and, established metadata standards.
We will now be making these templates available to VectorBiTE members to give feedback on. Following this, different working groups will be coordinating data entry into these templates. Some of the working groups are already aggregating/collating these data. 
Are in the process of developing a web interface for the databases using the Web2Py full-stack web framework.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Welcome to join the network!</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B93756BA-6E06-4B7B-9D98-17341D1CB3D6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.overleaf.com/5005585rjyswb#/15490324/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E6BBB6C8-CD35-45FF-A60F-2D97C572F615"><gtr:id>E6BBB6C8-CD35-45FF-A60F-2D97C572F615</gtr:id><gtr:title>Real versus Artificial Variation in the Thermal Sensitivity of Biological Traits.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The American naturalist</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5c7de72ec78f88ffbc48a5a89d8d78b1"><gtr:id>5c7de72ec78f88ffbc48a5a89d8d78b1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pawar S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0003-0147</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N013573/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>685A8D5E-BD8A-4D8D-BAC5-607439217156</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DE30777A-E4A8-486B-875D-58CC92FD5525</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Population Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
