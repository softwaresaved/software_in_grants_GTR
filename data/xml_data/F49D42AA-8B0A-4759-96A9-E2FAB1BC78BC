disability and access</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M00922X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>While toilets are often thought to be a mundane space, for those for whom a lack of adequate or accessible toilet provision is a crucial practical issue on a daily basis, toilets are 'the big necessity' (George, 2011). For some, a lack of adequate or accessible toilet provision is a crucial practical issue on a daily basis. Disabled people, for example, frequently report that accessible toilets are 'not accessible enough' (there may be too few, or they may be too small for larger wheelchairs, or not have a hoist or changing space) (Changing Places, 2013), while other studies show that diminishing numbers of public toilets can prevent older people leaving the house (Knight and Bichard, 2011, Department for Communities and Local Government, 2008). Thinking around toilets, and their function as material as well as socio-cultural environments, presents an opportunity to think in multi-faceted ways about forms of identity. Toilets often present a stark visual and material enactment of a gender binary ('Men's Toilets', 'Women's Toilets', 'the Ladies') in ways that can be problematic for trans, genderqueer, or non-binary people who do not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. Conversely, it is often the 'accessible' (disabled) toilet that provides a gender-neutral space. For some disabled people, this can serve as an example, reflected in the built environment, of the oppressive assumption that they are genderless and asexual (Kafer, 2013).

In recognition of the fact that the social issue of toilets is about practical access and personal affect, this project uses arts- and practice-based approaches to experiment with 'toilet talk' as a method of investigating issues of 'access' and 'identity' in relation to gender and disability. While the research and activities will focus around gender and disability, we also seek to consider additional intersections of identity including race, ethnicity, age, religion and faith. Five research workshops based around the arts practices of reflective storytelling, making/creating and performance, will take place between April and September 2015, in collaboration with three community partners: Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP), Queer of the Unknown (a performing arts collective) and Action for Trans* Health. Following these workshops, ideas and reflections will form part of an Architecture Live Project undertaken by MA Architecture students at the University of Sheffield, resulting in a number of installations/provocations. These installations will be displayed in public spaces in Manchester with the intention of stimulating city users to reflect on issues of access and identity in social spaces. The activities and installations will be captured in innovative visual and material forms that will be displayed at an end of project event targeting urban planners, architects and other city professionals. The aim of the project is to explore and disrupt received notions of 'access' and 'identity' and to find ways of articulating the idea that 'peeing is political' (Molotoch, 2010, 2).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As outlined in the Pathways to Impact document, the project has been co-devised and developed in close conjunction with project partners Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP), Queer of the Unknown and Action for Trans* Health. As such, capacity for impact has been considered at each stage of the research/dissemination process. This statement outlines both the direct and immediate beneficiaries, but also the more indirect and longer term impact that will outlast the 9 month duration of the project. Direct and immediate beneficiaries include: project partners and their networks of members and/or client user groups; non-HEI Connected Communities researchers; city-users that engage with the installations/provocations developed through the research process; urban planners, architects and other city professionals (including policy makers) targeted through existing networks by the end of project event (detailed further in Pathways to Impact). Indirect and longer term beneficiaries include: disabled people and their families, trans* people, and others for whom toilet access is a problem (older people, people with children and carers, for example), policy makers, city professionals reached through less direct means (e.g. networking, blog, press coverage).

Each individual research workshop (Stage One - April-September 2015) has been co-designed with Community Co-Investigators representing the interests of their members or user groups. As such, each workshop will result in the production of a tangible output which can be used through the campaigning activities of project partners. Project partners, however, are also keen for public engagement to be a core component of the project. Therefore, Stage Two involves collaboration with Sheffield School of Architecture to create a series of installations/provocations based upon Stage One findings which will engage city users in creative and stimulating ways (October-December 2015). We envisage these installations as having the potential to attract local press coverage, thereby maximising impact beyond the remit of those who directly engage with the installations. Publicisation of the installations to media outlets will be facilitated with the support of Sheffield Hallam University's Media Centre as well as the contacts and resources offered by Leeds University's Arts Engaged team. Finally, an end of project event in December 2015, will employ these installations/provocations to 'target', and disseminate learning to, architects, urban planners and other city professionals.

We aim to assess and evaluate impact at each stage of the project through methods which include recording participant responses to workshops in an appropriate and sensitive manner (through written and/or oral forms), public and media responses to the installations, and facilitating a (moderated) comment section of the project blog (see Pathways to Impact). Such responses will all add to the rich and varied data collected, and will feed into the production of an end of project event. More indirect and longer term beneficiaries of any changes in policy and practice will include those for whom a lack of adequate toilet provision currently restricts wider access to community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37851</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A soundscape and animation documenting stories of journeys taken/not taken due to in/accessible toilets</gtr:description><gtr:id>59C117D5-5761-406D-AA21-E59872147EBC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Used in training, teaching and at public events</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Travelling Toilet Tales Soundscape/Animation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://aroundthetoilet.wordpress.com/storying-school-toilets/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>in Stage 2 of the project Masters Level architecture students from Sheffield School of Architecture doing a 'Live Project' module created a public installation and game based upon the data from our workshops. These outputs raise awareness of difficulties surrounding the accessibility of public toilets within the public domain of the city and provided us with an engagement tool which has a legacy beyond the timescale of the Live Project.

The installation disseminates the findings of 'Around the Toilet's' research by creating an interactive game. Participants are given a scenario and persona card and the aim is to find a 'toilet' which meets the needs of the scenario. The aesthetics and structure of the installation adopts a design language, which is common to toilet cubicles. Using copper plumbing fixings and pristine white acrylic panels to produce a demountable, nomadic installation. The participatory game is designed to be informative and encourage discussion animates this low-tech, tent like copper structure.</gtr:description><gtr:id>26418D00-2789-4AD6-BE78-269D7D3C25EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It has been used in performances by community partners, and was displayed at our end of project event.

It included talks, films, t-shirt making and a performance from one of our community partners, Queer of the Unknown. We filled a gallery space with the art and creative outputs from the projects, and an installation that's been made for us by student architects on their 'live project' module. 

50-60 people attended altogether, with many more engaging on Twitter. We used an app called Periscope which meant it was broadcast live on our Twitter Stream. This was at the request of a disabled woman who runs a blog called Accessible Toilets, as she couldn't make it to the event. A funding bid for future collaborations with the Accessible Toilets campaign have been submitted to be part of the AHRC Connected Communities Utopia Festival.

This was a great networking event. As well as disabled, queer and trans people who've been involved in or are members of the partner organisations that have been involved in the project, we also had architects and those interested and working in the built environment, representatives from Public Toilets UK, Truckers Toilets UK, Accessible Derbyshire (who are advocates for Changing Places Toilets), Period Positive (a menstruation education programme), and a journalist who'd heard about the event and came along from a local Manchester newspaper.

The Around the Toilets postcards, tote bags and t-shirts are being used by various organisations, including Action for Trans Health, Queer of the Unknown, The Joyce Layland LGBT Centre and The Proud Trust. For example, the postcards were used a prizes at The Proud Trust's Trans* Youth conference.

We have received invitations to collaborate and display the Around the Toilet installation at various projects in the UK and abroad. For example, in September 2015 Slater was invited to Toronto to share initial findings with self-advocates with labels of learning difficulties, indigenous elders and other activists and campaigners at a three day event on 'Intimate Citizenship'. We have been contacted by Gail Howard from the Tu Fewn Project in Cardiff to display the installation and hold a panel event over summer 2016. We are displaying artifacts from the project at the Loitering with Intent Exhibition at The People's History Museum, Manchester, in July-Sept 2016. Gemma Nash, a disability artist that worked on the project, has applied to be an artist in residence position at The Art House, Wakefield, and is basing her work around project findings (demonstrating that the project has an impact on individual participants trajectories, as well as wider societal impact). Masters students from The Royal College of Art are offering visual interpretations of our work.

Around the Toilet has received additional funding through the AHRC Connected Communities Utopia Festival Grant for two further project (not listed as grants through Research Fish) which has allowed for further outputs:

1) a series of animations documenting journeys taken/not taken due to in/accessible toilets. These have been used in various training sessions, teaching and public events.
2) The Toilet Toolkit - an interactive online guide to toilet accessibility aimed at architects and design professionals.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>98222008-72D4-4AAF-8CEC-D866C54CBBCB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. A lack of accessible toilets stops people leaving the home. It determines how people travel around, and where or whether they work. It affects people's engagement in the wider community, the city and the countryside.

2. Disabled toilets are currently, and necessarily, a resource for more than just disabled people. For example, parents (especially fathers) may use them to take their children of a different gender to the toilet; trans people may use them as the only gender neutral space. This may put a strain on an already sought-after space, and it is therefore important to recognise the need for more gender neutral, larger and accessible toilet spaces. Recognising the more polyvalent needs of users leads not only to more efficient toilet spaces, but also helps to think more broadly and intersectionally about identity itself, although this doesn't always lead to easy answers. Some disabled people, for example, thought that baby changing facilities shouldn't be placed in the disabled/accessible toilet as changing a baby can take a long time, and prevent disabled people from having access to the toilet. Other disabled people who were also parents, however, pointed out that they needed the baby changing facilities in the disabled/accessible toilet to be able to care for their children

3. There is a need to question and broaden what 'access' means. Although ramps and larger spaces are important, access to toilets is also about handrails, shelf-space, sensory access (such as avoiding strip lighting and considering the placement of hand-driers), cleanliness, gender (and gender policing), widths and heights of doors, cost, geographical placement, a place to wash, for carers and personal assistants to change adults and children, and so much more. As numbers of public toilets rapidly decline, it is also about confidence and a lack of shame to ask to use the toilet in quasi-public places (shops, pubs, cafes etc.).

4. Architectural practices have been difficult to engage during the project. This may be about conservatism of the institution, a reluctance to see 'toilets' as a space of aesthetic/design importance, or reluctance to engage with academics/communities. It may also be about the arts-based methods that were used in the project. The arts were an important aspect of the project, allowing, for example, the use of humour and roleplay to talk about potentially 'awkward' topics; stories to be anonymised yet remaining embodied through drawing; and engagement with broader tactics of toilet activism/protest movement activities that aim to challenge status quo through re-labelling/re-designing, provocations, graffiti. Yet, perceptions of this as 'not real research' (a claim that we would challenge) may have simultaneously discouraged the engagement of practitioners and professional bodies. It may be that findings/modes of engagement need to be taken to architects specifically, rather than asking them to join other workshops and activities.

5. The following topics emerged continuously in the project, and warrant further exploration:
- the role of religion and faith in relation to access and toilets;
- the role of school toilets as part of wider socialisation practices in respect to gender, disability and embodiment more broadly;
- labour and public toilets (e.g. who cleans the toilet?)
- the impact of closures of public toilets on everyone, but disabled people in particular amongst broader context of austerity and welfare cuts;
- the difficulty in defining what a 'public toilet' is. i.e. how do feelings of entitlement to use certain toilets such as in Starbucks or M&amp;amp;S, vary dependent upon social positioning? Does a toilet in a railway station that you have to pay for (i.e. in a public space but actually private or 'for profit') a public toilet? How many truly 'public' toilets are there any more? Linked to this ('developing research questions'): what are the associated costs of gender neutral public toilets? If toilets are closing down, what are the economics of the provision of, say, 'changing places' toilets? And if public toilets no longer really exist then do we need to redefine the remit of the project i.e. accessible toilets for the public or accessible toilets away from home, rather than accessible public toilets.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Due to our effective use of social media, local and national media attention and clear evidence that people want to talk about toilets, we have been contacted over the course of Around the Toilet by various individuals and organisations who were either already running their own (often single issue) toilet campaigns, or who found that these issues resonated with them for a range of specific reasons. Our end of project event brought together Around the Toilet community partners alongside new voices (e.g. Loiterers Resistance Movement, Truckers Toilets UK, Public Toilets UK and Accessible Derbyshire). While Around the Toilet focussed upon issues of gender and disability, our evaluation of feedback and participant responses highlighted other key areas of exploration, including age, race, parenting, schools, and the labour of cleaners. Those engaged in 'single issue' toilet campaigns remarked that they had not thought before about the wider context of toilets and access, and have reported back on how they have fed wider issues into their own campaigns.One participant commented that the event 'had such a feeling of momentum'. 

We have also had demonstrable impact on trainee architects, who have reflected upon the impact of the project on their current and future practice. The eleven architects with whom we worked directly were an international group meaning our work will have international impact as these future practitioners take what they have learnt from Around the Toilet into practice. They have also left us with legacies aimed both at the general public (e.g. the installation) and architects (e.g. the draft toolkit for architects) which we are utilising in future projects (e.g. Utopia Fair funding).

As school toilets were a recurrent conversation in Around the Toilet workshops, we have begun to explore school toilets with children and educational practitioners.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>58B2BB38-F2DA-4102-B9D9-AAC7822E7E85</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://aroundthetoilet.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Slater advising on trans* toilet provision at Sheffield Hallam University</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA0F5794-2F49-4455-AC50-80C26DD240B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Slater is advising Sheffield Hallam University around the provision of toilet facilities for trans* students.
