We have known about the effect that burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has on the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere as well as its influence on global temperatures for many years now. However, the CO2 we put in the atmosphere does not all just stay there / because CO2 reacts with water, about a third of current fossil fuel emissions is removed by the ocean. This effect would be really helpful for us in preventing more extreme global warming from taking place, except ... in past few years scientists have realized that because CO2 dissolved in seawater creates a weak acid, we are causing the pH of the ocean to steadily decrease in a process known as 'ocean acidification'. There are currently about 380 molecules of CO2 in the atmosphere for every million of all gases combined ('parts per million' or ppm). Atmospheric CO2 is predicted to steadily increase in the coming decades, reaching 450-550 ppm by the year 2050 / a concentration that our Planet has not experienced in at least the past 3 million years. As atmospheric CO2 increases, so does the rate at which it will dissolve in seawater, forcing the pH of the surface ocean lower and lower. It is likely that ocean pH will reach values seen only rarely since the time of the Dinosaurs. Most organisms alive in the ocean today have never experienced such a large change in all their evolutionary history. Is this important? From laboratory experiments it seems that ocean acidification will affect marine organisms, particularly those that make shells and skeletons out of calcium carbonate, because calcium carbonate minerals become less stable as waters become more acidic and will eventually dissolve. If we fail to control CO2 emissions to keep ocean pH change within the limits calcifying organisms can cope with in the future, we may see dissolution of their shells, slower growth, failure to reproduce, dwarfism, or reduced activity, with impacts further the ecosystem. Unrestricted industrial activities may even push these organisms over an ecological precipice and cause extinctions. So what is going to happen in the future? In the geological past, organisms normally had thousands to millions of years to adapt and evolve in response to global environmental change. Although the global environmental change we are causing now is many hundreds of times faster, it would still take laboratory experiments conducted over decades to tell us whether marine organisms will be able to adapt to ocean acidification. By the time we know the answer, it may be too late! Luckily, there is an alternative path; one that lies hidden in rocks. The geological record, stored in the mud at the bottom of the ocean is packed with millions of microfossils that record how much change organisms can tolerate and how much is too much. We will take samples of ancient sediments that have been drilled from the ocean floor, analyse these samples using a range of state-of-the-art techniques involving detailed laboratory analyses, and apply complex computer models to help make complete sense of the numbers. This will tell us how the pH of the ocean changed in the past. By linking this information with observations of ecosystem changes and species extinctions will provide vital clues to what changes in marine ecosystems we might expect in the future if we do not make much greater efforts to curtail our greenhouse gas emissions now.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>53991</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Measurements made at the Ion microprobe faciltiy of volatile and trace elements in apatites have been used as part of study using minerals to assess volcanic hazards.

New 'early warning sign' for volcanic eruptions
By Helen Briggs BBC News 
Volcanoes are primed to erupt on a time scale of days to months rather than years, research suggests.
The study raises hopes of finding a more accurate way to tell when a volcano is about to explode, scientists at Oxford University say.
Gases emitted from the mouth of a volcano could provide clues to when an eruption is imminent, geologists report in Nature Geoscience.
They studied the dormant Campi Flegrei volcano in southern Italy.
The area west of Naples has been dubbed Europe's super volcano.
Hidden beneath the landscape lies a sleeping volcano of immense power, which last erupted in 1538.
Time capsules
Geological &amp;quot;time capsules&amp;quot; from the event contradict current thinking on how volcanoes are triggered to erupt.
Crystals of a mineral from the ancient explosion show the molten rock was &amp;quot;primed&amp;quot; - or filled with bubbles of gas - only very shortly before erupting.

Scientists say this process should change the make-up of gases emitted at the surface of the volcano, potentially providing an early warning sign that a volcano is about to erupt.
Prof David Pyle of the University of Oxford, a co-researcher on the study, said the mineral, apatite, can be used to &amp;quot;forensically extract the time history&amp;quot; of a volcano.
&amp;quot;You can use it to work out one of the critical things in when a eruption is about to happen - that's the point at which the magma body starts to become rich in gas,&amp;quot; he told BBC News.
&amp;quot;It will certainly help us think about periods when the volcano is just restless and periods when that rumbling has the potential to lead to an eruption,&amp;quot; he explained.
Early warning sign
Mike Stock, lead researcher on the study, said volcanoes can be &amp;quot;primed&amp;quot; on short time scales, which will help scientists interpret the signals expected to appear before such an event.
&amp;quot;When the magma forms bubbles, the composition of gas at the surface should change, potentially providing an early warning sign,&amp;quot; he said.
More work is planned to try to confirm the findings.
The research, carried out with the Durham University and the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, Rome, is published in the journal, Nature Geoscience.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Measurements of apatite chemistry could be used by others to help predict volcanic hazard</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0C7DDE62-4583-4368-91E2-69E9A6AC5527</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35431221</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/F017448/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62DCC1BF-B512-4BDB-A0C3-02BC17E15F6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biogeochemical Cycles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0E919A46-F083-4A92-8B31-A5AC7039CDE4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeobiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
