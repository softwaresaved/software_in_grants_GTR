Bacteria are a major subtype of microbes (or germs) that cause a range of infections and can also contaminate food and medicines during manufacturing. Tools for detecting bacteria are thus vital, but current methods are often laborious and slow, and require the use of a fully-equipped microbiology laboratory. This project will develop a new bacteria testing technology- called Lab-on-a-Stick - that makes detecting and identifying live bacteria simpler, faster and more portable at an affordable price. Ultimately Lab-on-a-Stick tests can be performed without lab equipment and read using a mobile phone camera.
Technology background: Microfluidics and Lab-on-a-Chip
Research over recent decades has developed technology called &amp;quot;microfluidics&amp;quot; using tubes with dimensions smaller than 1mm, typically around 0.1-0.2 mm wide to process reagents and samples. One major aim of microfluidic research is to develop miniature tests, with advantages of the small size including faster, automatic tests and smaller samples. These are referred to as &amp;quot;Lab-on-a-Chip&amp;quot; because complex lab procedures can be performed on a tiny microchip device. However, Lab on a Chip products are expensive and difficult to manufacture and have so far been limited to specialised high value applications, and most rapid disposable tests still use a more familiar format- the dipstick- e.g. pregnancy or blood glucose tests. The great advantage of dipsticks is their extreme simplicity- just dip in sample, and wait for a colour change. Dipsticks have disadvantages, so ideally the benefits of Lab-on-a-Chip microfluidic technology should now be adapted into a dipstick form. 
New technology: Lab-on-a-Stick
A collaboration between Reading and Loughborogh Universities led to the invention an entirely new approach -called Lab-on-a-Stick - that promises to deliver microfluidic properties with the simplicity and low cost of a dipstick. This technology exploits special properties of a novel microfluidic material previously studied by the applicant, but also adds a new modification that applies the science of nanotechnology - in other words a modification with dimensions around 1/10,000th of a millimeter. The resulting nano-modified microfluidic material has many beneficial properties, including the ability to perform 10 different tests after dipping into one sample, and as it is exceptionally transparent the tests results can be measured using a mobile phone camera. Remarkably it can still be produced at very low cost, using a simple, conventional manufacturing process, allowing cheap disposable tests that deliver the power of microfluidics.
Current project objectives:
Unpublished studies have already proven that the new dipstick microfluidic technology can perform three standard blood tests in a single drop of blood, and shown that bacteria testing is also feasible. This grant will build on these preliminary studies to produce fully functioning devices for detecting harmful and infectious bacteria in a smartphone-friendly dipstick format. The study will focus on developing a fundamental understanding of how to use the nanotechnology modification to perform accurate and sensitive bacteria tests using the new Lab-on-a-Stick technology platform.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A Public impact
Public health benefits 
This project is the start of a program to ultimately deliver new diagnostic and microbial testing products based on Lab-on-a-Stick (LoS) technology with significant public health and patient benefits. The closest to market application (~2-3 years) will be simpler, faster tests replacing current microbiology tests saving QC lab costs in food/pharma manufacturing. Clinical products for diagnosis of bacterial infection in patients will follow (~4-6 years) providing faster pathogen identification with major health benefits including rapid diagnosis and accurate antibiotic selection resulting in faster recovery. Central to MCF technology is a low manufacturing cost, which will deliver more tests for less healthcare expenditure. Long term, a broader range of LoS tests (e.g. biomarker measurement) will be developed, delivering point-of-care clinical tests that cut waiting times for results, and improving diagnostic precision and thus health outcome through personalised medication. The LoS platform has global application in real-world diagnostics, offering low-cost rapid multiple assays tests (e.g. infection screening) that can be performed in a field clinic. 
Public awareness of diagnostic technology innovation
There is a public perception of a need for faster, simpler and more accurate diagnostic testing; the public must therefore be made aware of ongoing research and innovation in testing technology. Public awareness of the simple but sophisticated LoS concept will be raised via media publicity following publication of project results.
B Economic impact
IP and technology commercialisation: Project findings will support commercial uptake of LoS technology and exploitation of background and arising IP, building value in UK technology (MCF film, LoS platform). The Point of Care and microbial testing markets are both &amp;gt;5Bn$ and rapidly growing. Commercialisation of IP will occur through evaluation, licensing, and product development either by existing microbial testing/diagnostic companies (e.g. Alere, Roche), or through startup Capillary Film Technology Ltd, as appropriate. In addition non-patentable expertise in affordable microfluidics will arise benefiting the Health Tech community via knowledge transfer. UK manufacturing SME Lamina Dielectrics will benefit from sales of the MCF they exclusively produce.
Expanding research capacity: The PI is establishing a track record in both low-cost microfluidics and in applied microbiology. These areas of expertise will be combined and expanded by the project in the critical field of microbiology testing. The project will also train a PDRA with broad interdisciplinary expertise, but also experience of innovation, technology transfer, industrial R&amp;amp;D, and research translation.
R&amp;amp;D investment, employment and wealth creation: The project will develop new technology of commercial value, plus expertise, to the HealthTech sector, resulting in employment and economic growth. Project-derived technology, IP and expertise will release R&amp;amp;D expenditure in the forms of industrial R&amp;amp;D (evaluation, product development) and/or private investment (e.g. angel, VC) to develop Lab-on-a-Stick products. Further research investment will follow from project findings in the form of grants from charities (Wellcome Trust, Gates Foundation) to develop dipstick microfluidic tests for worldwide unmet medical need in affordable testing and diagnostics (e.g. field clinic multi-infection dipstick tests). This investment will result in employment of researchers and tech transfer experts in both the private sector (HealthTech/Biotech) and Universities.
C Scientific and academic impact
The multi-disciplinary research outputs will enhance the UK's research reputation both through publication, and by developing translational applications of current world-class UK expertise in controlled release, materials science and low-cost microfluidics</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98490</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Loughborough University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chemical Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Nuno Reis</gtr:description><gtr:id>13281363-9411-4E14-B0E7-E3394461DC6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our multi-discpilinary collaboration brings life sciences together with physical and engineering science.

A second phase focused on partnering and/or raising private investment to develop products from the technology is now ongoing, as we start to understand in detail various commercial applications.

We have now completed PCT filling and entered regional phase for a new patent application which will be licensed to startup company Capillary Film Technology Ltd (subject to final license signature). The economic value to the UK life science industry of this research in generating IP with value is therefore clear, although further commercial development is required for full extent of economic impact to be defined and for products to be developed.

A second strand of impact relates to eventual clinical use of the technology, and discussions with clinical end users within the UK and overseas are ongoing to identify where the technology could best benefit patients and the public. To a certain extent, this societal benefit will follow from commercial uptake and securing the required investment and time to deliver clinical products.

The technology developed may be co-developed for diagnostic use with an overseas diagnostics company, but details of this partnership remain commercially sensitive and confidential. 

Once project findings are disseminated to industry and clinical users of analytical microbiology technology, the economic and societal impact will become more clear.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>70D71597-95B9-4172-A9FD-F1897CB0789A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>The present invention provides assay devices having a unitary body with an exterior surface, the unitary body being substantially transparent to visible light and formed from a material having a refractive index in the range 1.26 to 1.40, the refractive index being measured at 20 &amp;deg;C with light of wavelength 589 nm, and wherein the unitary body is formed from a hydrophobic material, and at least two capillary bores extending internally along the unitary body, wherein at least a portion of the surface of each capillary bore includes a hydrophilic layer for retaining an assay reagent, and wherein the hydrophilic layer is also substantially transparent to visible light to allow optical interrogation of the capillary bores through the capillary wall.
