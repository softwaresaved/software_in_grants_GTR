This question is of paramount importance to policymakers considering the effects of extensions to flexible working, yet the economics literature provides relatively little theoretical and empirical evidence on it. We find that when the woman in the couple has the freedom to choose daily work times subject to a weekly total number of hours (flexitime) there is greater spouse synchronization in working times. The effect is driven by couples with dependent children, who arguably value synchronization most. In contrast, when the man in the couple has flexitime at work it does not change the amount of spouse synchronization. Considering a broader measure of flexibility, control over working hours, we find that synchronous time is also greater when the man has working hours control. A third type of flexibility at work, annualised hours, does not seem to help spouses in synchronizing their daily time together.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work is intended to benefit a range of academic and non-academic users. Because this will be the first project of its kind in the UK and, to our knowledge, elsewhere, users include not only those from the UK, but also from Europe, North America, and other developed countries. Non-academic users include civil servants and policy advisors, notably the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Work, and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), which are the two Departments with a prime interest in flexible work; health professionals interested in the effect of working conditions on stress levels and health, and other women's interest groups interested in the reconciliation of work and family life (such as the Women's Budget Group and the Fawcett Society), as well as the Family and Parenting Institute . 

Policy makers will benefit from this work because the findings will improve our understanding of how access to flexible work affects time use within the household. This will have implications for policies designed to increase the work-life balance of families and promote equal opportunities for women. Because we will look at the impact of flexible work arrangements for different groups of workers and households, our results will inform policy makers about which groups should be targeted, and whether improvements in scope and targeting could be made.

The results will be relevant to third sector organisations working on human resource development and employment issues, such as the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development and the Work Foundation. Employees and families, and organisations that represent them, will benefit from the research by being able to use it to inform their campaigns for better understanding of their perspectives and provision of flexible working that they need to help them attain a sense of mastery over their schedules and to live their lives in ways that they, rather than their workplace, determines.

The findings of the project will be publicised to the general public and other interest groups through a dedicated section of the ISER and CTUR websites, which will be updated as the project develops. Key findings will be communicated in press releases to ISER's and CTUR's well-established network of media contacts, and non-technical summaries will be published in the ISER Newsletter, which has a circulation of several thousand.
We will seek opportunities to offer briefings and to present our findings in a policy context and to demonstrate their policy relevance to Government Departments, MPs with an interest in this field, and other interest groups. To that end we will exploit our close contacts with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), which are the two Departments with prime responsibility for flexible work, as well as contacts with third sector organisations, such as the Women's Budget Group, of which Dr. Sevilla Sanz is a member.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33147</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conversation with BIS (Flexible Working and Couples' Coordination of Time Schedules)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>68C0BA6C-463F-40A8-A308-33C9A765DC93</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We discussed the project (then still work in progress) during a visit to BIS on 17th September 2012.

We presented the paper at four academic conference (two outside the UK):

- European Society for Population Economics Annual Conference, Aarhus, Denmark, 12th June 2013
- Recent Developments in Labour Economics conference, Queen Mary University of London, 26th June 2013
- British Society for Population Studies (Families and Households strand), Swansea 9-11/09/2013
- European Association of Labour Economists conference, Turin, Italy, 20th September 2013.

In addition, we have presented our work at two specially organised workshops in our own departments (ISER Work Research Group, 29th January 2013, ISER JESS seminar, 5th June 2013).

Because some of the conferences happened after the funding for this project had finished, (see Section &amp;quot;Project changes&amp;quot; above), we went through a great length to assure that the results got the academic audience it deserved while the project was being developed. In particular, we organized a conference entitled &amp;quot;Recent Development in Labour Economics&amp;quot; that brought together international experts in labour economics. The conference took place at Queen Mary University of London in June 2013. This conference allowed a relaxed atmosphere to discuss our findings and hear about the latest debates in the academic literature and policy arena. Among the presenters were Francis Green (Institute of Education), Alan Manning (LSE), and Barbara Petrongolo (QM). We had over 30 participants, including junior and senior labour economists and a big proportion of PhD students from all over the UK. 

As planned in our original proposal, we have also organized a half day roundtable aimed at disseminating the results of our research to policy makers and practitioners. The event was held at Queen Mary University in London in June 2013 and was entitled &amp;quot;Flexible working - looking beyond productivity to work-life balance&amp;quot;. There we presented our results to members of third sector organizations, Mike Emmott, Chartered Institute of Personnel Development, Jenny Chanfreu, NatCen,Jonathan Swann, Working Families, Andrew Stocks, DWP, Katy Jones, The Work Foundation and Sarah Crown, Mumsnet. 
We posed questions to spark new collaborations about the areas in policy and practice currently suffering from critical knowledge gaps.

As a result of the interest generated by this project, Louise Clarke Cullen (ISER Communications Manager) successfully submitted an article on the project to the ESRC's Britain in 2014 magazine, which will bring the findings to the attention of a wider public.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>57E53EC2-8AF2-481A-8E25-D7BF7988E155</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>see previous submitted version
