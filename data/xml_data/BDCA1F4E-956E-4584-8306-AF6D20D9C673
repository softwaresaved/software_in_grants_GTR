of cell intrinsic and extrinsic forces during animal morphogenesis</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/J010278/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>When fertilized eggs start their development they are faced with an enormous challenge. The egg must divide many times to produce huge numbers of cells. In turn, these cells must be directed to become differentiated from one another and simultaneously rearrange in stereotypical ways to shape the tissues and organs of the body. This programme of movements is called morphogenesis. One of the most important early transformations that takes place in all animal embryos is the elongation of the embryonic head-tail axis from a short, wide tissue to an elongated narrow body. If this process of convergence and extension should fail, it is highly detrimental or more usually lethal to embryos. In humans, neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly are examples of the consequences of abnormal convergence and extension.

Two types of information are vital in trying to understand how morphogenesis happens. Firstly, identifying which genes are turned on to orchestrate it and, secondly, working out how the relevant genes control the generation of forces that drive embryonic reshaping. The last 30 years or so of developmental biology have seen a focus primarily on genetic explanations. This has begun to change with the recent revolution in our ability to image live embryonic development and even more recent progress in the automation of the tracking of cells and cell shapes within developing embryos. Our laboratories have been at the forefront d of these recent developments, and we are in an excellent position to be able to investigate the nature and changing balance of forces during development, and how these are orchestrated by the genes. 

The aim of this project is to use fruit-fly embryos as a model with which to develop methods to understand the forces that drive embryonic development. The fruit-fly embryo has a relatively simple single-layered 'epithelium' of cells on the outside of the embryo that converges and extends, and its genetics is very well understood. Forces in embryos are generated by contractions of cells in ways analogous to how muscles contract. During convergence and extension movements, cell contractions drive changes in cell shape and cause cell to rearrange. Importantly, forces generated by active cell behaviour will exert effects on neighbouring cells, that can transfer force onto their neighbours in turn, or respond by dissipating the force through changing shape or arrangement. Thus cells can experience a variety of extrinsic forces from cells near and far. Disentangling active cell forces from forces imposed extrinsically (from elsewhere) is one of the goals of this project.

Convergence and extension does not happen in a homogenous tissue. Gene expression varies across the tissue, and is correlated with patterns of the strength of active cell rearrangement behaviour. We will investigate the patterns of behaviour variation in detail, and correlate these with the patterns of gene expression and of the contraction of the cell. We will apply new methods to distinguish intrinsic cell rearrangement from passive rearrangement induced by extrinsic forces.

We will extend our current automated methods for tracking cells to track the full three-dimensional shapes of cells during convergence and extension. With such data we will be able to ask whether there are differences in the shapes and orientations of cells, whether they are tilted or wedge-shaped in ways that indicate the presence of local or distant forces. We will test hypotheses generated above about the nature of tissue forces using focused laser ablation, making punctures or cut lines to test if the tissue pulls apart in ways predicted by our hypotheses. 

The combination of developing new generic methods to disentangle embryonic forces in this simple model will be a major step in being able to tackle more complicated vertebrate models, such as the zebrafish and mouse and other models relevant to human birth defects and disease states.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Tissue morphogenesis results from the integration of intrinsic and extrinsic forces. Intrinsic forces are generated within a cell, while extrinsic forces are produced outside of the cell but both will determine cell shape and movement. Here, we aim at understanding how intrinsic and extrinsic forces integrate during the morphogenetic movement of convergence and extension, using an optically and genetically tractable model, the Drosophila embryo. 

During gastrulation in Drosophila, the germ-band tissue undergoes extension in the anterior/posterior (AP) axis and convergence in the dorsal/ventral (DV) axis. Polarized cell intercalation is the main cell behaviour contributing to this tissue shape change. By quantifying for the first time the strain rates of tissue deformation, we have found evidence that an extrinsic axial force deforms germ-band cells and contributes to tissue extension in parallel to polarized cell intercalation. We have also found that rather than being homogenous, the rate of polarized intercalation is patterned in the germ-band, along both AP and DV axes. These behavioural patterns might be explained by either intrinsic patterns controlled by gene expression, or by extrinsic factors, such as the axial force deforming the germ-band, or both. 

To distinguish between these, we will investigate i) which populations of cells are intercalating most actively, ii) whether gene expression patterns correlate with these patterns, and iii) if fluctuating cortical actomyosin can account for the differences in intercalation strength. We will use automated cell tracking of cell shape in 2D and in 3D, combined with quantification of actomyosin concentrations. We will develop novel methods to quantify the dynamics of cell-cell interfaces and cell packing during cell neighbour exchange and tissue shear. This work will identify signatures of intrinsic and extrinsic forces in the germ-band, which can then be utilised in more complex tissues.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries, the research from this proposal will benefit the public by increasing the stock of useful knowledge, by contributing to the creation of new scientific methodologies, by stimulating the development of scientific networks and thus increasing social interaction, by increasing the supply of skilled graduates and researchers, and by enhancing the problem-solving capacity through undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral teaching.

Increasing the stock of knowledge on morphogenesis is very important as this will impact many other fields and will support progress in medicine. Gaining a deeper understanding of morphogenetic mechanisms is essential to improve human health in three areas. First, to better understand birth defects, which are now the leading cause of infant mortality in developing countries, with neural tube closure malformations alone affecting 0.5-2/1000 pregnancies. Second, to understand cancer metastasis: there is evidence that many cancers invade healthy tissues through collective cell movements that are very reminiscent of embryonic morphogenetic movements. Finally, to develop regenerative medicine: tissue and organ engineering will require in-depth knowledge of morphogenetic mechanisms to be able to build three-dimensional structures following stem cell manipulation. Creation of new scientific methodologies will complement the increase in knowledge about morphogenesis and support progress in the above areas as well. In addition, software tools and protocols developed through the proposed work will increase the stock of scientific methodologies that can be applied to a variety of other problems. 

In conducting the proposed research, reducing a complex biological problem to a more simple numerical description will involve the development of numerical skills that are directly applicable to a wide range of problems in science and society. We are actively training students at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral level, who will benefit from gaining numerical and problem-solving skills. The knowledge and methodologies gained from the proposed research will also be disseminated through the creation of specific forums such as a wiki site, the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre and the QuanTissue Research Network Programme. This will develop scientific networks at national and international levels and thus increasing social interaction within the UK and beyond.

An indirect impact of the proposed project is that Dr G. Blanchard's (named Researcher co-Investigator) growing expertise as a scientist in the field of animal development will continue to support his essential role in the medical voluntary sector as a Research Trustee of The Neuroblastoma Society (Reg. Char. 326385, http://www.nsoc.co.uk/). Neuroblastoma is a neuro-developmental solid childhood tumour with very poor survival rates. The impact is two-fold, allowing him to know how to galvanise the UK scientific and clinical neuroblastoma community and providing the knowledge base to help inform the lay parent community of recent developments. He oversaw the Society's biennial grant round (2009/10) in which &amp;pound;0.5M was allocated in research grants. He also conceived and organised the first UK Neuroblastoma Research Symposium, held on 3/12/10 at the C.R.I. in Cambridge (programme http://www.nsoc.co.uk/symposium2010.html). This Symposium featured 16 talks from international and UK world leaders in neuroblastoma research, 20 posters and 150 delegates. He co-authored a lay meeting report of the Research Symposium, 1000 copies of which have been disseminated to parents via charities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>364043</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Mathematics and Statistics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Dr Alex Fletcher, Sheffield University</gtr:description><gtr:id>755232D8-2693-48FF-A55B-F61CED780859</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper under revision for journal eLife (as at 1st March 2016) with Alex Fletcher as co-author:

Six years active work as Research Trustee of Neuroblastoma UK (NBUK, Reg. Char. 326385, http://www.nsoc.co.uk) liaising with the UK and European research and clinical neuroblastoma communities combines well with his expertise gained as a scientist in embryonic development. As a result he is able to effectively galvanise the UK research and clinical neuroblastoma communities, to ensure the charity's grant allocation process follows best practise, and to use his knowledge base to inform the lay parent community of recent developments.

Specifically, over the course of grant BB/J010278/1 (April 2012 - October 2015), he has had a significant impact on the UK neuroblastoma research, clinical and parent communities in the following ways:
He has overseen NBUK's last two biennial grant rounds (2012, 2014), in which &amp;pound;1.75M was allocated in research grants. He reformed the charity's Scientific Advisory Board to become independent, international and fit for purpose to assess UK-led grants.
He organised two Neuroblastoma Research Symposia, the 3rd and 4th Symposia in what is now a biennial series (http://www.nsoc.co.uk/symposia.html), bringing together the UK and European neuroblastoma clinical and research communities and featuring worldwide experts as speakers. The 3rd Symposium was held in Liverpool in 2013 as a satellite meeting of the 10th National Cancer Research Institute Cancer Conference. The 4th Symposium was held in Newcastle in November 2015 as a collaboration with the group of European neuroblastoma clinicians (SIOPEN), and attracted 250 delegates and 70 posters from across Europe. The impact of these meetings is ensured in part by scientific meeting reports that have all been published in the journal Pediatric Blood &amp;amp; Cancer, with Guy Blanchard as corresponding author on the 3rd (Bell et al., 2014). The Symposia stimulate knowledge exchange and collaboration, and in particular support younger researchers by providing plenary opportunities and prizes for poster presenters. The number and quality of grants the charity receives per grant round has increased dramatically as a result of these Symposia.
As Guy Blanchard's neuroblastoma knowledge base has expanded, informed in large part by his research as a developmental biologist, he has written numerous lay reports in the NBUK (e)Newsletter, with a circulation of over 1000 people affected by neuroblastoma, including reports of the last three biennial world-wide Advances in Neuroblastoma Research meetings. He has also contributed the correct statistics and commented on issues surrounding neuroblastoma and its treatment for various national and local news articles. NBUK Trustees are currently responding to the NICE appraisal of two immunotherapy drugs for neuroblastoma and are pushing for an overhaul of the cost-benefit criteria NICE uses to assess paediatric drugs, hoping to change policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2211F6B7-C7D3-4D83-871E-841BEB4386AC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>All of the work supported by grant BB/J010278/1 has now been published or submitted for publication. A total of 8 publications, listed at the end of this report and cited below as [1-8], explicitly acknowledge funding from grant BB/J010278/1. Six of these are already published [2-6,8], one is under revision for the journal eLife [1], and one has been placed on bioRxiv pending resubmission [7]. In addition to grant applicants G.B. Blanchard, R.J. Adams and B. Sanson, the other direct contributor named in the application was Claire M. Lye (Letter of Support), a postdoctoral fellow in B. Sanson's group, who was an experimentalist collaborator on the Drosophila germ-band extension project [2]. Rob J. Tetley, who collaborated with G.B. Blanchard on [1], was a PhD student in B. Sanson's group.

Convergence and extension movements elongate tissues during various morphogenetic processes in embryo and organ development. Starting at gastrulation, axis extension in arthropods and vertebrates involves such movements. In Drosophila this process is called germ-band extension (GBE) and is the focus of the main outputs of this grant [1,2]. GBE is driven by two complementary mechanisms. First, within the trunk epithelium, active cell rearrangements drive the dorso-ventral (DV) convergence of the tissue for 90 minutes, pushing its extension along the anterio-posterior (AP) axis of the fly embryo. Active convergence is driven by Myosin II motors that are planar polarised within germ-band cells, enriched at DV-oriented cell-cell interfaces (Bertet et al. 2004 Nature 429:667-671; Zallen &amp;amp; Wieschaus 2004 6: 343-355). Second, cells become elongated along the AP axis during the first 30 minutes of GBE, suggesting that an extrinsic tensile force contributes to axis extension (Butler et al. 2009 Nat. Cell Biol.&amp;nbsp;11: 859-864). The germ-band is thus an ideal model tissue in which to investigate how morphogenesis is sculpted by the interplay between cell-scale intrinsic and tissue-scale extrinsic forces.
 
Our first major paper resolves the evolution of patterns of Myosin II polarity over the course of GBE [1]. The localisation of Myosin II in cells of the germ-band was thought to be determined by the orientation of cell-cell interfaces, with DV-oriented interfaces enriched in Myosin II (Rauzi et al. 2008&amp;nbsp;Nat. Cell Biol.&amp;nbsp;10:1401-1410). Recently, however, a combinatorial code of Toll receptors downstream of pair-rule genes was found to contribute to this polarization via local cell-cell interactions (Pare et al. 2014&amp;nbsp;Nature&amp;nbsp;515:523-527). In [1], we have developed novel computational methods to analyse the temporal dynamics of Myosin II. We show that initial bidirectional cell polarization gives way to unipolar enrichment at parasegmental boundaries and at two further boundaries within each parasegment. This occurs concomitant with a doubling of cell number as the tissue elongates. These boundaries are the primary sites of cell intercalation, behaving as mechanical barriers and providing a mechanism for how cells keep their order during GBE. Using laser ablation, we have confirmed that boundary interfaces are likely to be under greater tension than similarly oriented non-boundary interfaces. Strikingly, cell behaviours and Myosin II enrichment do not differ in wingless mutant flies, strongly suggesting that pair-rule genes, and not segment-polarity genes, direct boundary formation and behaviour during GBE. Variable cell number in the posterior half of each parasegment and the early enrichment of Myosin II at parasegment boundaries lead us to propose an updated cell-cell interaction model for Myosin II polarisation.

This first paper [1] has been favourably reviewed at eLife, and we are currently responding to reviewer comments. The Reviewing Editor has summarised the paper thus: &amp;quot;The paper is very well-written and the quantifications are extremely well-done and precise. The consistent quantification of the process over 80 minutes of development is in itself a significant achievement and provides with a nice picture of how myosin redistributes during germ-band elongation. Taken together, the paper is a step forward in our understanding of the very subtle mechanisms that control convergent-extension in Drosophila.&amp;quot; 

Our second major paper concerns the nature of the extrinsic stretching force that assists early GBE [2]. We characterized the AP cell elongation patterns during GBE in detail, tracking cells and quantifying their apical cell deformation over time. AP cell elongation forms a gradient culminating at the posterior of the embryo, consistent with an AP-oriented tensile force originating from there. To identify the morphogenetic movements that could be the source of this extrinsic force, we mapped gastrulation movements temporally using light sheet microscopy to image whole Drosophila embryos. We found that both mesoderm and endoderm invaginations are synchronous with the onset of GBE. The AP cell elongation gradient remains when mesoderm invagination is blocked, but is abolished in the absence of endoderm invagination. This suggested that endoderm invagination is the source of the tensile force. We next looked for evidence of this force in a simplified system without polarized cell intercalation, in acellular embryos. Using Particle Image Velocimetry, we identify posteriorwards Myosin II flows towards the presumptive posterior endoderm, which still undergoes apical constriction in acellular embryos as in wildtype. We probed this posterior region using laser ablation and showed that tension is increased in the AP orientation, compared to DV orientation or to either orientations more anteriorly in the embryo. We propose that apical constriction leading to endoderm invagination is the source of the extrinsic force contributing to germband extension. 

Below we summarise how our published papers have addressed and solved the 6 original aims of the grant.

Aim 1. Measure patterns of cell rearrangement across A/P and D/V embryonic axes during germ-band extension (GBE) in Drosophila using (i) small domain strain rates and (ii) detailed measures of cell-cell interfaces.

In [1] we have analysed in detail the patterns of cell rearrangement across AP. We found that the rate of intercalation, as measured using small domain strain rates, was highest in the posterior half of each parasegment which lead us to look in detail at how individual cell-cell interfaces were behaving differently. We found novel DV-oriented boundaries along which new cell contacts predominate. We have also found cell rearrangements associated with shear along these boundaries that have not been previously reported.

Aim 2. Image double-labelled Myosin II and membrane fluorescent embryos and implement automated tracking of myosin II flows across cell cortices. Relate actomyosin behaviour to detailed cell behaviour and to tissue patterns.

Rob Tetley (PhD student in B Sanson's group) imaged wild-type and wingless mutant flies with both cell membrane and Myosin II fluorescence in two different colours. We developed new methods to quantify independent measures of Myosin II bipolarity and unipolarity for all germ-band cells in multiple embryos across 80 minutes of GBE. These form the basis of the analysis in [1]. 

We also analysed Myosin II-driven apical fluctuations in cells of the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland placode [4]. We showed that during tubulogenesis of the salivary glands in the fly embryo, the microtubule cytoskeleton undergoes major rearrangements, including a 90&amp;ordm; change in alignment relative to the apicobasal axis, loss of centrosomal attachment as well as apical stabilisation. Disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton leads to failure of apical constriction in placodal cells fated to invaginate. We show that this failure of constriction is due to loss of an apical medial actomyosin network whose pulsatile behaviour in wild-type embryos drives the apical constriction of the cells. The medial actomyosin network interacts with the minus ends of acentrosomal microtubule bundles through the cytolinker protein Shot, and disruption of Shot also impairs apical constriction. Thus, microtubules are important in salivary gland cells for the apical localisation of Myosin II and for apical contractility.

Aim 3. Optimise automated tracking of the 3D shapes of cells in Resille-fluorescent embryos. Develop and implement new metrics to measure the dynamics of 3D cell-cell interfaces, local tissue curvature, cell tilt and wedging to formulate hypotheses about apical and/or basal contractile or extrinsic tensile forces.

Guy Blanchard developed methods to track the 3D shapes of cells over time in Resille-fluorescent embryos imaged on confocal and SPIM microscopes by Dr Claire Lye and by a Part II student, Tom Rootsey, whom they both supervised. This is on-going work, now focused on tracking the apical surface of cells across the whole 3D surface of the embryo.

Aim 4. Quantify patterns of simple shear during GBE and formulate hypotheses about the nature and orientation of shear forces in the tissue.

As mentioned above, we have identified a novel type of cell rearrangement due to shear along DV-oriented boundaries in the germ-band [1]. This built on the project of a PhD rotation student, Helen Fox, supervised by Guy Blanchard, who developed methods to identify and quantify tissue rotation associated with shear during GBE.

Aim 5. Measure patterns of epithelial lattice structure and cell packing structure across the germ-band to distinguish regions of proposed active and passive intercalation.

In [1], we present a novel method to classify each cell-cell interface over time as being actively shortened or passively lengthened, depending on the relative geometries of the 4 cells surrounding each interface. This method confirms that interfaces along the DV-oriented boundaries that we have identified as being enriched in Myosin II, also display actively shortened geometries, compared to passively elongated non-boundary interfaces.

We also completed a complementary project analysing the early development of the zebrafish forebrain, in which cell rearrangements occurred with the opposite signature to those in the germ-band. We propose that these are passive cell rearrangements, induced by a combination of cells reducing their apical surface area while the lateral extent of the forebrain tissue is pinned in place [7].

Aim 6. Test above hypotheses about the balance of forces by (i) comparing patterns in wild type flies with those in A/P and D/V patterning mutant flies, and (ii) performing focused and oriented apical laser ablations.

We have tested the extent and balance of intrinsic and extrinsic forces in the germ-band in various ways. We discovered that the posterior mid-gut invagination drives the extrinsic force responsible for stretching the germ-band along the AP axis during the first 25 minutes of GBE [2]. We established the origin and direction of this tensile force in acellular embryos by performing laser ablations with different orientations and locations. The laser ablations were made using an instrument purchased with the equipment budget of this BBSRC grant and installed on a 2-photon microscope in the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Facility (http://caic.bio.cam.ac.uk).

Focusing on the intrinsic force driving active cell rearrangements, we show that in wingless mutants the strong Myosin II enrichment at parasegment boundaries during GBE is unaffected [1]. This unexpected result shows that the early Myosin II enrichment at the parasegment boundary is likely to be directed by pair-rule genes. We also used laser ablation to show that boundary interfaces are under greater tension than similarly oriented non-boundary interfaces.

We also explored the nature of intrinsic forces during GBE through developing a cell-based model. This was performed in collaboration with Dr Alex Fletcher (Sheffield University) using the Chaste modelling platform. We were able to mimic observed patterns of cell rearrangements at boundaries in a simulation in which we permitted cell-cell shear along boundaries [1].

Guy Blanchard has become increasingly interested in the mechanics of embryonic epithelia. Over the course of this grant he started to develop new methods to infer quantitative mechanical estimates in collaboration with the group of Nicole Gorfinkiel (CSIC, Madrid), with physicist Pedro Machado (PDRA in the group of Alfonso Martinez-Arias) and with mechanicist Jocelyn Etienne (LIPHY, Grenoble). Building on initial laser ablation results in wild-type and Myosin II over- and under-expression flies [5] and exploring in a model the various ways in which contractile forces could generate pulsatile behaviour [6], they made a first attempt at direct mechanical inference in an epithelium in vivo, using the Drosophila amnioserosa model tissue. Using large datasets of strain rates and using Myosin-II fluorescence as a proxy for active force generation, they treated cells as natural experiments of mechanical response under cyclic loading. For the first time, they established relative changes in separate effective mechanical properties in vivo. Over the course of Dorsal Closure, the tissue solidifies and effective stiffness doubles as net contraction of the tissue commences. We further show that tissue stress increases four-fold, explaining how a progressive increase in Myosin-II activity can lead to tissue contraction despite an increase in stiffness. The amnioserosa was the ideal first tissue in which to explore novel mechanical inference methods because Myosin II occurs primarily in apico-medial pulses and not at cell-cell junctions, and there is no cell rearrangement. In future grants (see below) we plan to extend these methods to the more complex germ-band and salivary gland tissues.

We will continue to give research talks on these papers and write reviews, further ensuring that our findings are properly disseminated to the researchers most likely to benefit from our insights.

The new image analysis methodologies developed during this grant are all incorporated into a software application called 'otracks', a pipeline of image analysis tools that Richard Adams and Guy Blanchard have developed over many years. This software is available to collaborators through a Mediawiki web-site, 'wikiTracks', designed and maintained by Guy Blanchard. Users can log in, download software, read and amend protocols for running the software and post questions. 

We have plans to invest in the functionality and usability of this software pipeline, making key parts of the pipeline open source. Specifically, we have researched and submitted two grants to the BBSRC, both as continuations to BB/J010278/1, to ensure that methods become available to UK researchers. In November 2015, we submitted a BBSRC Tools &amp;amp; Resources Development Fund (Call 2), with Alex Fletcher (Sheffield) as PI, B&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;dicte Sanson as Co-PI and Guy Blanchard as Res. Co-I (&amp;pound;130K): &amp;quot;A computational pipeline for integrating quantitative analysis and simulation of Myosin II motor-driven cell behaviours in epithelial tissues&amp;quot;. This proposes the development of a software tool to measure the cellular localisation of Myosin II and of an open source mechanically sophisticated cell-based simulation of Drosophila axis extension. In January 2016 we submitted a BBSRC standard grant (&amp;pound;364K): &amp;quot;Mechanics of embryonic epithelia: Inferring stresses, material properties and mechanical feedback&amp;quot;, with B&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;dicte Sanson as PI, Katja R&amp;ouml;per as Co-PI (MRC/LMB) and Guy Blanchard as Res. Co-I. This grant proposal includes 3 years PDRA salary for Guy Blanchard, in part to enhance and make open source existing cell tracking and Myosin II quantification software. Software will be co-developed and served from the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre (http://caic.bio.cam.ac.uk). CAIC is a University of Cambridge facility of strategic importance, drawing together expertise in imaging, microscope design, image and signal processing and analysis. CAIC will be a major portal for us to interact with and facilitate interested researchers, in and beyond Cambridge.

The laser ablation instrument bought with the equipment budget on this grant has been installed on the CAIC 2-photon microscope and is available to other users in the School of Biology through this research facility. The equipment purchased consists in a LaVisionBiotec laser ablation module (&amp;pound;23,950) and an Olympus PLAPON 60XO/1.42 objective (&amp;pound;3,321.50). Both our publications on germband extension [1,2] include laser ablation experiments, validating the use of the instrument for other users. For the experiments in [2], we collaborated with Leila Muresan from CAIC on the data analysis, and CAIC users we will be able to benefit from these methods to analyse their laser ablation experiments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>86F74F44-BFF0-4262-990A-5C85343096C5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We and our collaborators use our 'otracks' software suite for analysing movies of embryological development at cellular resolution.
