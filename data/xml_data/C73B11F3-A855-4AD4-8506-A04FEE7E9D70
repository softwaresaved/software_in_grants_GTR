The constitution, approved in a public referendum in August 2010, enshrines rights to cultural, indigenous and minority heritage which Kenyans have never previously enjoyed. It is currently being implemented, and different groups are bringing or planning claims to cultural rights, which have far-reaching implications for peace and social unification. The constitution will potentially democratise and decentralise heritage management by devolving powers to 47 new county governments, which has major consequences for National Museums of Kenya (a research contact involved in the PI's previous study). The proposed research will, as implementation proceeds, examine connections among the ways in which citizens exercise these particular rights, social cohesion and national peace prospects. Civil society groups that include established contacts are planning to use the constitution to assert rights and make a variety of claims, for example for the return of 'ancestral land', access to sacred sites, intellectual property, and protection for endangered languages. This positioning process began as soon as the constitution was passed, and is increasing day by day. Hence the research is highly topical and urgently needed. 

While positive in some respects, since culture can be a tool for development and peace building, there are dangers that claims to cultural rights could lead to the further concretisation of 'tribe' and essentialised ethnic identity, the promotion of sub-nationalist ('tribal') identities, a clash between human rights and cultural rights, a retreat into deeper ethnic enclaves and the hardening of ethnicised territorial boundaries. Any of these may exacerbate social tensions and sabotage peace and unification efforts. Yet the aim of the constitution is the exact opposite: to unite the nation. This fundamental contradiction, and the potential pitfalls, have not been recognised yet by the state and other key players. The research will examine and analyse these processes and the public debates and discourses around them, mapping the impact as constitutional provisions are both implemented and interpreted. It will produce timely information for policy makers, heritage managers, heritage stakeholders (who include civil society groups and individual citizens), donors, NGOs, law implementers and bodies delivering civic education. This will have practical uses at a crucial time for Kenya, as constitutional change transforms the country. 

Case studies in different communities will track the 'social life' of claims over time. They have been chosen for their ethnic, geographical and subject variation; their potential for yielding rich data that answers our research questions; and because our existing familiarity with contacts and issues secures access. A fourth may be added or substituted if opportunity arises. The cases are:

1. Efforts by the indigenous Yaaku community of Mukogodo Forest, Laikipia, to save an endangered language, and gain political prominence at local county level in order to redress historical marginalisation.
2. A campaign by people living around the Yala Swamp, western Kenya, mobilised by a local NGO, for recognition of their rights to land that has been 'grabbed' and turned into a rice farm by a US evangelist. (This is a non-ethnicised, non-indigenous claim, in counterpoint to many others.)
3. Maasai claims for redress for historical injustices including land and resource alienation (multi-sited). The PI has substantial knowledge of these, since activists plan to use her historical evidence of colonial land alienation (Hughes 2006, based on 2002 D.Phil.).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Cultural Rights and Kenya's New Constitution

This collaborative and interdisciplinary research is the first to document and analyse the impact of cultural rights provisions in Kenya's relatively new (2010) constitution on Kenyan society and its heritage sector. The research team, which includes British, Kenyan, Canadian and South African scholars, aims to produce analysis, policy recommendations and empirical data that will be of use locally and internationally. 

The constitution, approved in a national referendum in August 2010, enshrines a number of rights to culture (the constitution does not define the word) which Kenyans had not previously enjoyed. It also allowed for the devolution of government to 47 new counties, many of which are investing in cultural activities, often linked to tourism and marketing. Some county governments are also drafting their own cultural legislation. We have, since constitutional implementation began, witnessed a flourishing of engagement with culture across the nation, at both national and county level and by a wide variety of stakeholders - state and non-state. 

The PI originally envisaged when writing the bid that citizens would use the constitution to bring claims for cultural rights, such as the return of 'ancestral land' or special protection for indigenous groups, but with a few exceptions that has not happened. Reasons include the fact that most communities lack funding to pay lawyers' fees. Also, recourse to the courts is not the only way of giving life to constitutional rights provisions. Hence the research focus has broadened to an exploration - via case and desk studies - of the different ways in which Kenyans are exercising their cultural rights, or engaging with 'culture'. 

While positive in some respects, since culture can be a tool for development and peace building, we foresaw dangers that claims to cultural rights could lead to the further concretisation of 'tribe' and essentialised ethnic identity, the promotion and reification of sub-national identities, a clash between human rights and cultural rights (especially where women's and children's rights are concerned), a retreat into deeper ethnic enclaves and the hardening of ethnicised territorial boundaries. Any of these may exacerbate social tensions and sabotage peace and unification efforts. Yet the aim of the constitution was the exact opposite: to unite the nation. This fundamental contradiction, and the potential pitfalls, do not appear to have been recognised by the state and other key players, before constitutional implementation began. The project is examining these processes and the public debates and discourses around them, mapping impact as constitutional provisions are both implemented and interpreted. It will produce timely information for policy makers, heritage managers, heritage stakeholders (who include citizens and civil society groups), donors, NGOs, law implementers and bodies delivering civic education. This will have practical uses at a crucial time for Kenya, as constitutional change transforms the country.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>628157</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog for World Vision - Lotte Hughes</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>30C3FFE7-967E-4322-B612-858F4B006786</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A blog written by PI Lotte Hughes about Alternative Rites of Passage in Kenya was published on the blog of the international NGO World Vision on 6th February to mark the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM (female genital mutilation).

The panel discussion sparked questions, comments, and rich discussion with the audience. Though the audience that day was about 45 persons, news of the event will have reached other festival goers. The event (and other contacts made at the festival outside this panel activity) also generated contacts we have followed up on, e.g. invitees to future project events.
I was invited to take part in, and organise, a panel discussion at Storymoja, Nairobi (an annual international literary and arts festival) on the theme cultural rights and constitutional change, subject of my new ESRC-funded research project that started 1 Sept. 2014. I was asked to invite panelists of my choice, who included Kenyan scholars, an indigenous rights activist and cultural heritage practitioners. The event, held at Nairobi National Museum, also allowed me and co-author Karega-Munene, fellow panelist, to talk about our new book Managing Heritage, Making Peace: History, Identity and Memory in Contemporary Kenya (third co-author Annie E. Coombes did not attend); the panel discussion began by focusing on this book. Afterwards we signed copies at the Storymoja Festival bookshop.

One member of the audience, a Kenyan law student, said he would, as a result of the event, choose to write his thesis on the topic of the discussion. Others asked for more information about the research project, and how they could engage with it. 

We have been in touch with the organisers to see if they were able to provide specific feedback on our panel but they were not able to.

This is a prestigious event, sister festival to Hay Literary Festival in the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog - Centre for Contemporary African History - Zoe Cormack</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B2A2365C-493F-46F0-BAE3-557EE216FE8C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Gone with the wind?' a blog written by Zoe Cormack (former project Research Associate) and Abdikadir Kurewa (National Museums of Kenya) was published by the Centre for Contemporary African History, Durham University.

The colloquium, entitled Cultural Rights and Constitutional Change in Kenya: Progress and Challenges, was held at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, London on 12th October. It was attended by members of our project Advisory Board: Clara Arokiasamy (chair), Prof. Mary Hickman, Dr Neil Carrier and Prof. John Wolffe. Other attendees included Sir Edward Clay (former British High Commissioner to Kenya), Dr. Nici Nelson (Goldsmiths), Victor Lal (ICS), Dr. Jeremy Lind (Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex), Lucy Claridge (Legal Director, Minority Rights Group), Edward Paice (Director of the Africa Research Institute), Nicholas Watts (ICS) and Ramnik Shaw (lawyer and writer).

Feedback forms were completed by attendees, who all reported that they felt their knowledge had increased, their thinking about issues had been changed, and that our work could be useful to policy makers and had wider uses outside Kenya. 

With regard to increased knowledge, comments included references to 'original, cutting edge research' (Nici Nelson). Elsbeth Court felt her knowledge of post-constitution legislation had increased. Jeremy Lind thought we offered 'fascinating insights on the background, history and cultural rights provisions in the constitution.' Edward Clay felt it useful to be reminded of the timescale and context of Kenya's constitution and that we 'illuminated the difference between declaring rights and enforcing them'.

A paper presented by team member Steve Ouma Akoth was mentioned twice in response to a question (on the feedback form) about how the papers had changed the way attendees think, once by Jeremy Lind and once by Neil Carrier. Nici Nelson and Ramnik Shah both made reference to (PI) Lotte Hughes's paper in this regard. Several people reported that they would use what they had learnt in their own research and writing - Elsbeth Court, Nici Nelson, Jeremy Lind, Neil Carrier, Victor Lal and Ramnik Shah. Edward Clay felt it might be useful in teaching/training.

Elsbeth Court thought our findings could be useful to 'museums' provisions for contemporary art and history of Kenya'. Jeremy Lind thought we had 'very clear insight for diverse fields - health, land, resources, peacebuilding, gender'. Ramnik Shah also felt that 'policy making could be done on a more informed basis'. Sir Edward Clay expressed the view that 'diplomats and policy makers need first to listen in order to understand phenomenon with which they have to deal.' He went on to say that the research had uses outside Kenya, in terms of 'trying to pin down what traditional values and culture mean and ways of promoting what is good and dealing with what is divisive and corrosive. Several other respondents felt the research would be useful in other contexts, particularly in areas that involve grappling with new constitutions or cultural rights issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>stakeholders workshop (Nairobi, Kenya)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>393B1BB0-C62F-453F-B498-20F6C4DED4BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the first of two annual one-day workshops for cultural rights' stakeholders (principally Kenyan), aimed at engaging with local audiences and facilitating knowledge exchange and discussion between different sectors. The attendees included human rights lawyers, NGO practitioners, scholars, students, environmental activists, anti-FGM activists, staff of National Museums of Kenya, local writers and publishers, et al. Three panel discussions on the overall theme 'Cultural Rights in Critical Perspective' sparked many questions and lively audience discussion. Responses continued by email and in blogs on our project website, following the release of a workshop report. Feedback forms were used on the day to elicit positive responses from the majority of participants. We aim to continue this conversation at future events including a final conference in Nairobi in soring 2017.

Impact Report on Nairobi Workshop 
Date: 14 April 2015
Attendees: 37 (Including 4 project staff and 4 student assistants). We were very pleased with the response we got, both in terms of the numbers of people who wished to attend and the prominent position many of them have in Kenyan civil society. We were also pleased with the diversity of organisations and interests represented as we had considered this carefully when putting the event together.

It was entitled 'Cultural Rights in Action: from global policy to local practice', and aimed largely at local cultural stakeholders. The morning session featured a keynote by Kenyan High Court Judge Joel Ngugi and presentations about the project team's research. The afternoon session centred on a roundtable discussion with key contacts and research assistants.
38 people attended. We were very pleased with the response, and the variety of backgrounds and different interests represented by participants, as one of the main aims of the event was to facilitate discussion between sectors which do not usually get the opportunity to talk to one another (e.g. heritage, the judiciary, academe, human rights practitioners, NGOs, etc.). We were also pleased with the diversity of organisations represented. 16 people went on to attend the afternoon session which was designed to be a smaller and more intimate event giving further opportunity for discussion. 
Everyone who filled in a feedback form felt that their knowledge of cultural rights and constitutional change had increased as a result of taking part in the workshop and agreed that they had learnt something new from mixing with other stakeholders. 74% said that the workshop had helped them to think about this topic in a different way and 87% of the respondents (87%) said that they planned to use what they had learned at the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://katibaculturalrights.com/2016/05/09/alternative-justice-systems-and-the-katiba-judge-ngugis-keynote/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Northern Ireland Roundtable</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DE2F949-7B36-4578-BE56-172C87FC191B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project team held a Roundtable on Cultural Rights and Post Conflict transformation: Perspectives from Kenya and Northern Ireland at Queen's University, Belfast, on 14 October 2016. The event was hosted by Neil Jarman of The Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, Queen's, and included papers by Steve Akoth, Lotte Hughes, Mark Lamont and Prof. Colin Harvey (Queen's). The aim was to explore some of the parallels between post-conflict challenges in Kenya and Northern Ireland, especially concerning identity, culture and rights/justice, and to share ideas and insights with colleagues working on that country. 

Prof Harvey commented: 'International human rights law, and human rights lawyers, would tend to frame these conversations as the state failing to uphold international human rights standards at the national level by not protecting individuals from human rights abuses by third parties.' He wondered to what extent these questions also emerge in the relevant state reports to the UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies (and what those treaty monitoring bodies have had to say as part of the narrative around these questions). He said he thought the work presented raised stark questions around what might work in order to build an effective human rights culture in practice.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Development Seminar (Open University, Milton Keynes)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE3A5C50-23A2-42C0-BFD0-20AB533AB7F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Zoe Cormack (project Research Associate) gave a paper entitled Promoting Pastoralist Heritage and Alternative Visions for Development in northern Kenya.

1. An item listed under Influence on Policy. This describes how Karima Bennoune, the current UN Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, cited PI Hughes's work in her first (Jan. 2016) report to the UN's Human Rights Council. Bennoune stated that she will be acting on Hughes's ideas (expressed in a paper presented at the University of Copenhagen in Nov. 2015, at a conference on cultural rights which Bennoune attended) in her future work as Rapporteur. Her term of office began 1 Nov. 2015. The conference is described under Engagement Activities.
2. Collaborative awareness-raising work between the PI and the NGO World Vision [WV], which facilitated her field research on FGM and Alternative Rites of Passage in Kenya in Nov/Dec 2016. This has involved WV posting a blog by Hughes on their website on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM (6 Feb. 2017), which drew public responses. WV media staff also tried to place a different blog in the UK media to tie in with the same event, but unfortunately media did not pick it up. We are currently discussing how to take the collaboration forward, possibly by producing a joint briefing report for policy makers, donors, the Anti-FGM Board of Kenya, et al.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4CB71C13-D53A-4071-AECF-D73C6D451EC9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>NB: THIS WHOLE SECTION IS NOT COMPLETE AND WILL NOT BE COMPLETED UNTIL AFTER THE PROJECT ENDS [31 AUG 2017]
The following findings are divided according to case or desk study, we will add a section on Overall Findings.

1. County Governments and the Uses of Culture (Case/Desk Study by Mark Lamont and Gordon Omenya)
- Devolution of governance means significant changes in the ways 'culture' speaks to the liminal or grey boundaries between 'human rights' and 'community rights'
- Rights will be a new battleground in global geopolitics as they are played out in Africa (as proxy wars were to the Cold War)
- There is an urgent need for anthropology and other related disciplines to re-examine their theoretical ambivalences towards the 'culture' concept in light of its instrumentalisation in the real world
- With the creation of county governments in Kenya, alongside massive investments in infrastructure and extractive resource industry, NGOs and community-based organisations (CBOs) find themselves in critical roles as facilitators and trainers in the transformation of governance under devolution, which gives rise to further questions about the future of neoliberal policy and governance in Africa.

2. Northern Kenya infrastructure and cultural rights (Case Study, Zoe Cormack)
- The defence of 'culture' has been taken up as a way of negotiating the impact of infrastructure projects and changing uses of land in Northern Kenya
- International NGOs and rights groups are involved in re-articulating the meaning of culture or heritage, but they are also working closely with national and local organisations which aim to change perceptions about pastoralism and its value
- Culture and heritage are being drawn into the politics of development. Ideas about culture both shape and are shaped by anticipated transformations such as the LAPSSET project
- Cultural rights claims can compete. The construction of shared heritage can have unifying effects, but it can also be divisive, especially in places where infrastructure/industry is changing the value of land.

3. FGM and Alternative Rites of Passage (Case Study, Lotte Hughes)
- FGM/FGC is usually described as a 'cultural' practice', but in fact it may have less to do with 'culture' than, for example, social reproduction and customary norms
- The local and globalised 'moral panic' around FGM tends to focus attention exclusively on the physical 'cut', to the exclusion of other important elements of girls' initiation and graduation to womanhood which have received less attention
- Alternative Rites of Passage (ARP), which its proponents tout as an alternative to FGM but without 'the cut', may be understood and analysed primarily as cultural performance and an invented tradition rather than a 'development' activity. It is an example of the new ways in which 'culture' is being used and instrumentalised in Kenya today, to make quick connections between 'the modern' and 'the past', for present purposes
- Christian faith leaders, together with Christian symbolism and practice, are a central feature of ARP, and should also be understood as cultural actors and signifiers - a fact ignored by most commentators, NGOs/donors and the few scholars who have researched and written about ARP..

 Forced Male Circumcision and Ritual Violence in Kenya (Case Study, Mark Lamont)
- Male circumcision is emphatically denied as a form of (ritual) violence, although 'forced male circumcision' is a human rights abuse and a criminal act
- The 'cut' in both male and female cases is only a highlight of the ritual process, but most commentators ignore this fact, focusing instead on the spectacle generated by controversy
- Forced male circumcision has a quasi-legal status, as vigilante discipline, in the view of its perpetrators and, often, its victims (fostering the kind of court silences over this particular form of violence in Kenya)
- The continuation of male-upon-male (sexualised) violence is furthered by a generalized campaign among leading public health organizations to condone and support voluntary, safe circumcision as a prophylaxis against HIV-infection.

4. A Comparative review of Cultural Rights provisions in the Kenyan Constitution (Desk Study, Harriet Deacon)
- Compared to other constitutions globally, the Constitution of Kenya (CoK) provides very broad rights protection, including protection for cultural rights
- The CoK represents 'culture' in different ways, and sets up different kinds of rights and responsibilities, at the national, group and individual level
- The CoK, like the South African Constitution, represents culture (in the singular) at the national level in a 'neutral' way as 'civilisation', democratic values, and national pride; this has been criticised for lacking a Kenyan 'cultural fingerprint'
- The CoK recognises the rights of culturally-defined groups to practise their cultures (in the plural), as long as these are consistent with human rights provisions; it seeks to protect the interests of cultural minorities and indigenous groups within the devolved county system
- Like many of the constitutions influenced by civil law traditions, the CoK protects 'freedom of artistic creativity' as well as freedom of expression and cultural association in accordance with the Bill of Rights.

It is too early to say what the longer-term impacts may be. But the highly respected blog 'IP Kenya - Intellectual Property from a Kenyan Perspective' - picked up on the formal submission made by Dr Lotte Hughes, Prof John Harrington and Dr Harriet Deacon to the Kenyan Government on two draft bills. The blog did so in Dec. 2015, and discussed our submission, name-checking the authors, in the post given below. We subsequently engaged with the blogger, Kenyan scholar Victor Nzomo, who attended a workshop we hosted in Nairobi in April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://ipkenya.wordpress.com/2015/12/16/comments-on-the-protection-of-traditional-knowledge-and-traditional-cultural-expressions-bill-2015/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Report by the UN Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3CC438E1-687A-4F6C-BC2D-E940FD98A73E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/CulturalRights/Pages/SRCulturalRightsIndex.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8EB1AC62-8690-4F5F-80B4-1FE9BB93CEEB"><gtr:id>8EB1AC62-8690-4F5F-80B4-1FE9BB93CEEB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Negotiating Cultural Rights</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2c216e37500c085170658dd1564a9a66"><gtr:id>2c216e37500c085170658dd1564a9a66</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hughes, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4EC84C7A-0100-49C3-A629-716AADEC78D5"><gtr:id>4EC84C7A-0100-49C3-A629-716AADEC78D5</gtr:id><gtr:title>The promotion of pastoralist heritage and alternative 'visions' for the future of Northern Kenya</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Eastern African Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a68c73642d7ac86de5b95c77424888f9"><gtr:id>a68c73642d7ac86de5b95c77424888f9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cormack Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/80117A5E-DC40-491D-A0D9-912F79FD819E"><gtr:id>80117A5E-DC40-491D-A0D9-912F79FD819E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Culture Practice has changed Kenya under the new Constitution</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e5bf6fc73403cd1ef9111c76014dd02e"><gtr:id>e5bf6fc73403cd1ef9111c76014dd02e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Akoth, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F0069A71-036A-44D3-8E65-65355B6F2452"><gtr:id>F0069A71-036A-44D3-8E65-65355B6F2452</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pluralism in Kenya</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2c216e37500c085170658dd1564a9a66"><gtr:id>2c216e37500c085170658dd1564a9a66</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hughes, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5F7AF94F-9EC3-4BDB-9190-6C8BF7927E79"><gtr:id>5F7AF94F-9EC3-4BDB-9190-6C8BF7927E79</gtr:id><gtr:title>A comparative review of cultural rights provisions in the Kenyan constitution</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5289d7ba60f23361c1f436459aaf63e1"><gtr:id>5289d7ba60f23361c1f436459aaf63e1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Deacon, H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F98D20ED-164B-4F25-AA50-AFA9181576CF"><gtr:id>F98D20ED-164B-4F25-AA50-AFA9181576CF</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Cultural rights: a work in progress?'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2c216e37500c085170658dd1564a9a66"><gtr:id>2c216e37500c085170658dd1564a9a66</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hughes, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L011603/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp;
