Many of the key events that contribute to the maintenance and viability of the cell, and that are perturbed in disease depend on these interactions. Researchers have developed methods to identify and characterise these interactions. In general terms they often involve 'marking' or 'tagging' one of the proteins to be examined in such a way that the 'tagged' protein can be selectively isolated and the associated partners identified by a technique called mass spectrometry. However, current methods for this analysis are not always satisfactory and can be probematical when there are low levels of such proteins or when the interacting complexes are not stable. Here we propose a method we call SILAC-iPAC that combines several techniques, each of which has been used in other contexts, but never before in combination, that we believe will offer a significant improvement in the ability to identify protein-protein partners under these conditions. In addition, we propose to include specifically developed software to enable the easy and accurate analysis of any data obtained with the technique.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Affinity capture and MS analysis is a powerful method for the analysis of protein-protein complexes. A common method is TAP-tagging. This depends on the affinity isolation of a 'bait' protein containing a double tag. However, traditional TAP-tagging requires a strictly serial processing and this can compromise recovery, especially from low abundance or unstable complexes. Here we propose a modified affinity capture technique. We again use a 'bait' protein with two separate tags, but process cell extracts in parallel using columns for each tag. To discriminate between specific and non-specific binding we use stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). We call this SILAC-iPAC. We will also explore the potential for using cleavable cross-linking in combination with SILAC-iPAC to isolate and characterize transient interactors. Our initial 'proof of principal' experiments will use DT40 cell-lines containing TAP-tagged protein engineered to express the tagged protein from the tag-modified endogenous gene by homologous recombination. An integral part of our proposal is also to develop an associated software package for the facile analysis of data generated by this method. We envisage that our method will be of wide applicability to many situations in cell biology and biochemistry where understanding and analysing protein-protein complexes is essential.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main advance form this project will be the development of SILAC-iPAC and the production and dissemination of associated software. Full descriptions of this work will be published in peer reviewed litterature and presented at academic conferences. Biochemistry/cell biology community: Protein-protein interactions lie at the explanatory heart of most key biochemical and cell biological processes including, but not limited to: cell metabolism, DNA repair, gene expression and signal transduction. Developing accurate, sensitive and robust proteomic methods, including associated software for the analysis and characterisation of these complexes is a major priority. Databases that catalogue these structures are also essential. Proteomics community (both academic and industrial): There are already close collaborations between the University of Cambridge and several mass spectrometry vendors and proteomics software vendors including Thermo Finnigan, Applied Biosystems, Waters and Matrix Science. The proteomics community as a whole will benefit from the development of such widely applicable methodology and associated software as well as the generted databases. KSL has collaborated with Matrix Science and Applied Biosystems for many years including Applied Biosystems contribution to a BBSRC award which resulted in the first developments of organelel proteomics methods. We envisage that such collaborations with mass spectrometry vendors will continue throughout the period of this grant, and will result in us working with the appropriate vendors to incorporate them into the workflow. Pharmaceutical industry: The PI has given talks frequently to the pharmaceutical industry on cell biology and ion channel topics including Glaxo Smith Kline and Pfizer, and has numerous contacts with these industrial research groups. KSL has discussed proteomic methodology with Glaxo Smith Kline, Astra Zeneca and also Genentech. The methodologies developed within the context of this proposal are so fundamental that they could underpin many area of pharmaceutical research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>109530</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster presentation at ASMS conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5EEC60A8-839E-4586-800B-58338EB9AE96</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A poster on SILAC-iPAC was presented by postdoc JSR.

Very useful advice was obtained that enabled us to solve a technical issue that was causing trouble in the first attempts to carry out SILAC-iPAC.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Proteins in cellular systems often interact to form functional complexes. But in many cases, these interactions can be rather weak and sometimes transient. This makes it difficult to fully characterise the interactions by traditional methods such as simple immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (MS). Worse, current MS methods are so sensitive that many non-specifically interacting proteins can be identified in 'pull-down' experiments and without some quantitative way of measuring them, it is difficult to discriminate between specific and non-specific interactors. 

In SILAC-iPCAC, a cell-line is generated that stably expresses a protein of interest with two epitope tags. This cell-line and its tagless control cell-line are differentially SILAC labelled. Lysates from the two cells are mixed and the tagged protein is independently purified form MS analysis, using appropriate affinity resins in parallel. This enables a very sensitive and quantitative assay for interactors, eben when the proteins are present at low levels. 

We used the method to examine two such proteins:
1) PI5P4K beta (PIP kinase). This protein is an important signal transduction enzyme. Yet previous MS analysis had not been able to rule out the presence of additional interacting proteins.

2) Fanconi anaemia core complex. This protein plays an essential role in DNA repair and is mutated in Fanconi anaemia, a major inherited cancer syndrome. 

We established:
1) There are no additional interactors with PI5P4K beta (PIP kinase) except for the enzyme alpha subunit. This negative result is important as it rules out protein-protein complexes and suggest the enzyme is targeted to the nucleus via non-protein protein methods. 

2) We identified known interactors of the Fanconi anaemia complex together with an additional protein RUVBL. This protein has not previously been implicated in the core FA complex, but is known to act as a single strand DNA binding protein. Its association with the core FA complex has 
previously been missed in earlier immunoprecipitation and MS analysis experiments. However, during the course of this work, we became aware of the work of Dr Eeson Rajendra (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology Cambridge), who had independently identified this protein as a component of the FA complex. However, the method used by Rajendra used nearly a thousand times the number of cells as our SILC-iPAC method. Thus SILAC-iPAC represents a significant increase in sensitivity compared to 'classical' IP methods.

3) It is not always appreciated that affinity matrices used for protein isolations can bind different proteins non-specifically. As part of our work, we also completed the first quantitative 'beadome' survey to characterise how different matrices bind different proteins. We believe that this is an important data resource in it own right.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Two papers describing this work have been published in the Journal of Proteomics (see publications).
