The nanoparticles are synthetic and designed to encapsulate drugs and carry specific markers that target toxic effects efficiently to the tumour cells while protecting other tissues, and thus reducing systemic toxicity. The nanoparticles in question differ to other synthetic delivery devices in terms of their greater loading capacity, improved drug retention and better targeting efficiency. The biggest challenge in their design, however, is how to optimize their specificity of action.We will develop novel mathematical models to tackle this issue. We will use the latest modeling techniques to discover how infiltration, targeting and uptake of the nanoparticles are regulated by their size, mechanical, chemical and membrane properties. Data generated from in vitro lab experiments with the head and neck cancers will be used to inform the mathematical approach for parameterisation and validation. We will then extend the validated models to predict the therapeutic effect in tumours in vivo, focussing on tumours that have acquired a blood supply and developing a model framework which will help focus an in vivo experimental program before animal studies begin. This will permit the investigation of different experimental situations which are technically difficult and the collection of data limited, at a minimum of cost and use of animal models. These targeting issues are relevant to the delivery field in general so our model will also act as a framework for targeted delivery for other tumours as well as other pathologic conditions. The aims of the project are:(i) To develop novel mathematical models of ligand-receptor binding of nanoparticles to cancer cells to predict how targeting can be enhanced by modulating the numbers of ligands and 'stealth' particles on the nanoparticles.(ii) To use data generated from cancer cell culture experiments to parameterise and validate the mathematical models and assess infiltration and delivery patterns in cell populations andidentify conditions of non-specific and actual targeting.(iii) To develop spatio-temporal partial differential equation models to make predictions about nanoparticle stability and therapeutic efficiency given different particle sizes, fluidity and membrane properties and different loads and combinations of cytotoxic drugs with different hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties.(iv) To modify the mathematical models to determine whether acidic tumour conditions can trigger premature release of the vesicle contents.(v) To utilize the mathematical models to inform in vivo experimentation by generating testable hypotheses for determining therapeutic efficiency.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One quarter of the population eventually develops cancer and the social (e.g. a reduced quality of life and life expectancy) and economic costs (e.g. medical costs and loss of earnings) are considerable. In monetary terms for the care of cancer patients, it is estimated that by 2012, we will see an above 200% increase to today's costs in caring for cancer patients (e.g. see Sikora, K., Cancer drugs - the economic challenge, Focus on Oncology, May 2008). Improvements in the treatment outcomes for some solid tumours have reached a plateau despite advances in surgery, chemo- and radio-therapy. Gene therapy offers the timely hope of a new and efficient tool for treating such diseases but safety concerns (including the possibility of inducing severe systemic toxicity) and efficacy has so far prevented a major breakthrough. Synthetic, self assembling biomimetic polymer vesicles (BPVs) are a completely new technology with the advantage that they can be used as ideal targetting delivery systems. This study will help shed insight into whether BPVs are able to significantly better deliver treatment than conventional forms of therapy. Furthermore, because of the flexibility of BPV design and chemical makeup, this work will pave the way to develop targeted delivery agents to a whole range of other pathologic conditions. The project will provide the PDRA with detailed training in the use of mathematical modelling to understand and make predictions for biological systems. The project depends crucially on model development and refinement using experimental data, in collaboration with experimentalists. The resulting models will then be solved using analytical and numerical techniques, teaching a range of methods including perturbation theory, stability analysis and bifurcation theory and providing training in writing numerical codes and in efficient numerical simulation. The PDRA will benefit from the thriving research environments at Strathclyde and Sheffield. Strathclyde has active research programmes in Mathematical Biology (including research into neurological and cardiovascular disorders, blood cell morphology, epidemiology, marine science, medical devices and tissue bioengineering) and the regular seminars and workshops will enable the PDRA to interact with other senior researchers and thus gain a broad training in Mathematical Biology. Dr Craig Murdoch's (CM; see Section 4 of Description of Proposed Research) group has expertise in the bioengineering, chemistry, pathology and clinical aspects of tumour targetting. The consequent active, interdisciplinary research environment will be highly beneficial to the PDRAs career development. Additionally, the University of Strathclyde provides excellent training for PDRAs in the development of generic skills and competencies and thereby widen their scope for future employability. SDW's long term goal is to become a future leader in mathematical biology, with a focus on drug development. A key component of this progress is to establish a research group in mathematical biology which is at the forefront of developing models that can make quantitative, testable predictions about real patients. SDW is already supervising a PhD student on a project which is directly related to the proposal. The EPSRC first grant will provide the core support required to expand this group and make the most of the research opportunities of EPSRC's development programmes, including senior research fellowships and large programme grants. Furthermore, the proposed project involves a strong interaction with leading experimentalists ensuring that SDWs research lies at the forefront of the latest biological developments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96036</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Arizona</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>New collaborations</gtr:description><gtr:id>999CA68F-6F6B-458D-A830-70DF4393D9F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In Collaboration with RJS:

Further, a new collaborative link was made through RJSs work with Prof. Tim Secomb (Department of Physiology, University of Arizona).

The results of our analysis are applicable to many pathologic conditions where nanoparticles are being used, and will provide the foundation for further work and collaboration.

Some techniques are currently in use while others are at various stages of testing and most of the major established companies have research programs on nanotechnology. The main problems for nanomaterials involve understanding possible toxic effects, how to improve their targeting and their controllability by external signals or by the local tissue environment. The research in this project is a first step towards constructing a modeling framework that can help reduce the risk and uncertainty in the particle-development process and provide guidance for the development of optimized nanomaterials for medical treatment. Our in vitro models are validated to reproduce data from concentration dependent experimental studies and accurately predict median number of polymersomes per cell and the percentage of cells that are positive for polymersomes. The validated models can provide insight into efficacy, safety and control of nanoparticle treatment. In particular, we can use the models to explain the differences in uptake between different cell lines, predict the optimal number of ligands per particle for maximal uptake, predict the critical effects of statistical variances in batch-to-batch variability on uptake, predict microenvironmental and cell-culture effects on uptake and inform dosage regimes and how to manipulate BPV properties to improve treatment targeting and delivery.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7CA2958F-6594-456F-BC1F-F421230CE5A1</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A set of coupled PDEs is used to extrapolate information from the cell-scale BPV binding models (Objectives M.1 and M.2) to a 3D tissue-scale comprised of tumour vasculature and surrounding interstitium. Blood flow and oxygen delivery are modelled using an approach reported previously in the literature (Secomb, T. W., R. Hsu, et al. (2004). Green's function methods for analysis of oxygen delivery to tissue by microvascular networks. Annals of Biomedical Engineering 32(11): 1519-1529). An explicit 3D tumour network from a rat is used for the simulations, provided by our collaborator Prof. Tim Secomb (Department of Physiology, University of Arizona). The oxygen field is coupled to PDEs that describe the distribution of pH, BPVs and drug in the tumour mass. H+ ions are produced in low oxygen regions and able to diffuse; buffering effects are also accounted for. The simulated spatial distribution of the various agents is currently being validated against extensive histology information obtained from vascularised tumours embedded in dorsal skinfold chambers from Dr Craig Murdoch's lab (work being completed by SDW and RJS). The final model will inform both dosage regimes (the concentration of BPVs required to distribute a critical concentration of doxorubicin throughout the tumour mass), and how to tune the surface chemistry of the BPVs (binding and internalisation rates) to maximise the treatment efficacy.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8DDA9D41-D618-4D38-9F36-47648AD0BF20</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No impacts as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>3D tissue scale computational model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We develop new mathematical descriptions of the ligand-receptor binding process (of BPVs to cancer cells). To do this we first derive a system of coupled differential equations describing the binding of BPV ligands to cell membrane receptors. To reduce the order of the system we apply novel statistical moment closure techniques to yield a much more amenable system (of equations for the mean number of bound BPVs per cell, the mean number of bonds per bound BPV and the associated standard deviations and higher order statistical moments). Closure is achieved by exploiting the fact that the distributions displayed typical Gaussian profiles, for which the higher moments can be calculated directly. A precise parameterization of this model is then achieved by converting this deterministic form into a stochastic model using a dynamic Monte Carlo Method and comparing the model simulations to the in vitro data. The parameterized framework can then be used to help fine tune the nanoparticle design (ligand number, particle size etc) for maximal uptake and treatment efficacy for different tumour conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8BC34BAD-875A-4300-BEB0-59E6E0CECC6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No impacts as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Stochastic computational model for nanoparticle uptake into cancer cells</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The ligand-receptor binding kinetics model (Objective M.1) was incorporated into a biomechanical description of an in vitro avascular tumour spheriod.

Both travellingwave and steadystate limits of the model are derived and studied and this allows us to make predictions about BPV infiltration patterns and treatment efficacy given different particle sizes and membrane properties.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E11E195A-0359-4CB4-9DC1-70DD92FAACCA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No impacts as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Biomechanical model for avascular in vitro tumours</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0B67520B-7373-434F-B3C8-9BE10927B9B4"><gtr:id>0B67520B-7373-434F-B3C8-9BE10927B9B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>A cellular automaton model examining the effects of oxygen, hydrogen ions and lactate on early tumour growth.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of mathematical biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/870460ab7471344536d1ab89c71ce23f"><gtr:id>870460ab7471344536d1ab89c71ce23f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Al-Husari M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0303-6812</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/570C4319-EFEA-4A73-BA93-CC24181EA6A0"><gtr:id>570C4319-EFEA-4A73-BA93-CC24181EA6A0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regulation of tumour intracellular pH: a mathematical model examining the interplay between H+ and lactate.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of theoretical biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/870460ab7471344536d1ab89c71ce23f"><gtr:id>870460ab7471344536d1ab89c71ce23f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Al-Husari M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-5193</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/60FC89A3-3FB7-4EB3-94DF-873E40153EBC"><gtr:id>60FC89A3-3FB7-4EB3-94DF-873E40153EBC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Theoretical predictions of lactate and hydrogen ion distributions in tumours.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/870460ab7471344536d1ab89c71ce23f"><gtr:id>870460ab7471344536d1ab89c71ce23f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Al-Husari M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EE2C6029-CDEB-441D-B434-BAB09083C4B1"><gtr:id>EE2C6029-CDEB-441D-B434-BAB09083C4B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Combined mathematical modelling and experimentation to predict polymersome uptake by oral cancer cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/58fc6be887bdd4689739d058f6946304"><gtr:id>58fc6be887bdd4689739d058f6946304</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sorrell I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1549-9634</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B5A769EC-A567-4BE5-9774-B238A56E76E0"><gtr:id>B5A769EC-A567-4BE5-9774-B238A56E76E0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Acid-mediated tumour cell invasion: a discrete modelling approach using the extended Potts model.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Clinical &amp;
