We propose a systematic genetic approach to identify potential developmental bottlenecks in the early stages of spike and grain development. We hypothesise that this approach will contribute to the identification of novel allelic variation that will deliver step-changes in wheat yield potential. Increasing wheat yields will require simultaneous improvements of both the 'source' and 'sink' and that the various yield components must be studied together to address the known negative correlations that exist between some of these traits (e.g. grain number and weight). However, a reductionist and systematic approach can be used as an initial step to understand the gene networks regulating each individual yield component. This knowledge can then be applied to assemble the best allelic combinations. 

This proposal is focused on the 'sink' side of the equation and specifically on the simultaneous increase of the number of grains per spike and the size of the individual grains. These yield components are mainly determined during a relatively narrow and well-defined window in the early stages of spike and carpel/grain development. We propose to focus on the critical early periods of spike and carpel/grain development, combine favourable alleles previously identified by our groups, and exploit exome sequenced tetraploid and hexaploid TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes) populations to identify novel allelic variants. The past wheat TILLING population will allow rapid evaluation of genes in null double-mutants, whereas the bread wheat population will complement this approach and allow deployment into elite bread wheat varieties.

In this project we will identify and characterise a set of genes regulating grain number and weight, and develop novel allelic combinations to enhance overall spike yield in wheat. We have validated a set of both natural and novel induced allelic variants from the TILLING populations that affect specific spike yield components and have systematically developed the germplasm, techniques, and functional genomics resources required to address the proposed objectives. We will exploit emerging genomic advances and will work closely with breeders to rapidly introduce this variation into CIMMYT germplasm. The variation and allelic combinations generated within this project have not previously been utilised in traditional wheat breeding programmes and, therefore, represent an unprecedented opportunity to make significant progress in the genetic yield potential of wheat.

The main direct outcomes expected from this research are: 

(1) Identification and characterisation (molecular, physiological and agronomic) of novel gene variants controlling wheat spike yield components 
(2) Creation of double and triple mutants targeting all homoeologs for the selected genes to overcome functional redundancy
(3) Generation of adapted germplasm with new allelic combinations affecting complementary spike yield components</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Urgent action is needed to sustainably increase global wheat production. However, limited knowledge of the genes controlling wheat yield is hampering efforts to advance towards this goal using science-based solutions. The aim of this proposal is to define, characterize, and manipulate genes that regulate the early stages of spike and carpel/grain development and that govern spike yield components (grains per spike and grain weight). We will apply innovative sequencing-based approaches to exploit novel sources of induced genetic variation in these two traits to increase the genetic yield potential of wheat. We will test if this potential is realized in elite wheat varieties. Understanding the genes controlling different yield components will allow us to combine and exploit variation across all three homoeologous genomes, and to overcome the perennial problem of functional redundancy observed in polyploid wheat. The combination of novel allelic variants in genes affecting grain number and weight represents an opportunity to generate significant increases in wheat yield potential not previously exploited in wheat improvement programmes.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from this research?

This research will benefit a series of non-academic parties. This include wheat and cereal breeders in the UK and globally; farmers in Europe, the US and elsewhere based on our collaborative work with the International Centre for Wheat and Maize Improvement (CIMMYT); and the general public.


How might they benefit from this research?
Breeders will be those which will benefit most directly. The work and resources developed in this project will allow them to develop wheat lines with enhanced yield potential using genetic markers to track what has until now been an extremely complicated trait to follow with markers. We will generate genetic material which will be in adapted backgrounds allowing them to assess the lines in their target environments and make the most informed decisions. This project will deliver the tools for breeders to develop the next generation of wheat varieties with improved yield based on specific allelic combinations. 

Farmers will benefit from having access to higher yielding wheat varieties across different target environments. They will exploit these benefits by growing wheat varieties developed after the end of the project. The fact that we will characterise the effect of different genes across development will allow us to provide combinations of genes which will enhance yield in different ways. This will allow us to develop wheat varieties which achieve enhanced yield in different ways, which we hypothesise would also be more stable yield. If this is the case, farmers would benefit enormously from having more resilient yielding wheat varieties in their fields. 

The general public will benefit through access to wheat based products derived from the varieties that include the new allelic combinations and genes produced in this project. This will require time between discovery and delivery, but ultimately the general public will receive the benefits of these new varieties. The public will also benefit from having increased yielding varieties across the world since this will help maintain food security and also political stability in many countries which depend on wheat as a staple crop. Food riots and political instability in recent years have been linked to food and bread prices (for example the Arab Spring) and recent immigration to Europe is predominantly from countries that have wheat-based diets. The reasons behind immigration are complex, but improving food security in the countries of origin will be an important factor to ensure that local food demands are met and to reduce social instability.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>544879</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this project is to define, characterize, and manipulate genes that govern spike yield components (grains per spike and grain weight). We have sequenced the transcriptome of an early spike and carpel/grain development time course and identified ten candidates to evaluate for spike yield components. To facilitate access to this data, we created wheat expression databases (WheatExp and www.wheat-expression.com) that have received over 30,000 page views in the past 12 months. Based on forward screens of the sequenced Kronos (durum) and Cadenza (bread wheat) mutant lines we developed ten populations segregating for yield traits. We combined phenotypic extremes from these populations into bulks to identify genomic regions containing mutant alleles underlying the traits. We have completed three populations and developed genetic markers for specific genomic regions, while another seven populations are ongoing. We have developed NILs for mutants in the candidate genes GW2, ARF2-1, and ARF2-2. Field trials have shown a consistent and significant effect of the GW2-A mutation on TGW. Double mutants of GW2 in Kronos showed a significant increase in TGW which translated into an increase in spike yield in replicated row trials. These double mutants will be further tested in the field in 2017. We have backcrossed the GW2-A mutant alleles into 23 elite CIMMYT lines and combined it with the Elf-Am3 mutant for increased spikelet number into two CIMMYT durums and Kronos. We will evaluate the combined effects of these mutants on yield during 2017. An additional five breeding companies have started introducing mutant alleles identified in this project into their advanced breeding lines. To facilitate training of new scientists in this area, we developed the www.wheat-training.com website.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Crossing into novel varieties by UK and international breeders</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C9EDA37B-5F11-4F43-9163-C7C950C156A3</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This website provides background information and practical resources to help both budding wheat scientists as well as researchers looking to expand their work into wheat.

There is a need to improve crops to feed the world's growing population with the backdrop of climate change. Translation of fundamental plant biology research (e.g. from Arabidopsis thaliana) into crops such as wheat provides a potential route to deal with this challenge. However learning even simple tasks such as growing and crossing wheat plants requires time and effort, while material and methods sections in published articles are often short and cannot substitute teaching aids. This is also true for more complex topics such as the genomics aspect of wheat.</gtr:description><gtr:id>367772A1-467B-446A-B342-539FA9D783BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2000 sessions</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Wheat Training</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.wheat-training.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This resource consists of TILLING populations developed in tetraploid durum wheat cv 'Kronos' and hexaploid bread wheat cv 'Cadenza' as part of a joint project between the University of California Davis, Rothamsted Research, The Earlham Institute, and John Innes Centre.
