We have discovered that the gel-like characteristics of mucus in saliva and now potentially in other mucus gels (e.g. the respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts) are caused by calcium binding in the large structural glycoproteins (mucins). Our evidence shows that this involves protein parts of the mucin linking mucin molecules together. Therefore we will identify the part(s) of the mucin responsible for calcium-binding by testing different parts of the molecule prepared separately and also in fragments of mucin purified from saliva. The details of how it functions and where it occurs in the structure of the mucin will be determined. We will also investigate whether mucins can be modified to remove or inactivate their calcium binding properties. This calcium dependent cross-link activity that we have detected in mucin is newly discovered and it is a potentially important mechanism contributing to the function of this vital protective barrier. Furthermore, an improved understanding of the organisation of this barrier has important implications for treatment of common diseases involving mucus overproduction (e.g. asthma and cystic fibrosis) and improved strategies for the delivery to and across epithelial surfaces of pharmaceuticals and gene therapy agents.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We have recently discovered a calcium dependent, reversible cross-link in MUC5B mucin from saliva, which increases the viscosity, greatly increases the average molecular weight and reduces the apparent porosity of the oligomeric mucin network. The activity was dependent on a single calcium binding site on each mucin monomer. This is a most important new finding as a mucus layer is a common means of protecting epithelial surfaces. Mucins are the major component responsible for the physical properties of the mucus gel, which are essential for its function. The properties have been interpreted until now as predominantly due to entanglement of the long, high molecular weight oligomeric mucins. We now have preliminary evidence that a comparable calcium dependent organisation is a feature of related oligomeric mucins namely MUC2 and MUC5AC. These two mucins are predominant gel-forming mucins in respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract mucus. Using a range of biochemical/biophysical and molecular biology techniques this proposal will investigate the hypothesis that the gel-forming properties of oligomeric mucin is based on the presence of calcium binding protein domains that form reversible links between these oligomeric glycoproteins. Our research has identified the calcium-binding domain in a 120kDa N-terminal domain of MUC5B recombinantly expressed in mammalian cells and the position of the site(s) will be further investigated by expression of smaller mucin sub-domains. The number of binding sites per mucin monomer will be confirmed and the ligand specificity, binding affinity and stoichiometry of interaction will be determined. The calcium dependent property of these 3 oligomeric mucins will be investigated as a mechanism of heterologous interaction between mucin family members. We will also investigate if alternative gene splicing and proteolytic processing provide mechanisms for regulating their supramolecular organisation and hence mucus properties. This project will thus identify the molecular basis of this novel supramolecular organisation of mucus gels. This research will characterise and evaluate how this newly discovered mechanism of reversible supramolecular organisation controls their physical properties. The results of this study will identify possible strategies for controlling the excessive viscoelastic properties of mucus associated with various pathologies and methods to enhance the delivery of pharmaceuticals and gene therapy across epithelial surfaces.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250508</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Calcium can mediate reversible interactions (KD 100nM) between oligomeric MUC5B mucins leading to the formation of a cross-linked, branched mucin network. Importantly, similar specificity of binding of the D3 subdomain of MUC2 to native MUC5B showed that calcium-dependent cross-linking is a common feature in this family of oligomeric mucins.



2. Two classes of calcium binding sites are present on native MUC5B mucins, these are:

i. Multiple, low affinity, electrostatic ion binding to glycans (KD 74_M, ~760 sites per mole) only detected at low ionic strength and;

ii. A single, high affinity, calcium specific protein site (KD 400nM, ~1 site per mole) active at physiological ionic strength.

The low affinity binding of calcium to the glycans was not responsible for network formation.



3. Calcium binding and the site of calcium-dependent network formation of native MUC5B mucin were localized to sites within the N-terminal D3 domain, using an antibody specific to a sequence within D3 and by binding experiments with recombinant MUC5B N-terminal protein sub-domains.
