interdisciplinary research project seeks to examine how, why and to what extent the Rising Powers (specifically China, India and Brazil) are enabling the transition to low carbon energy systems in Southern Africa. The project will explore the range of actors, institutions, partnerships and policy-making processes involved in these contemporary forms of ?South-South? co-operation and technology transfer and aims to identify the key interests and beneficiaries being served here. Empirically focused on case studies of Mozambique and South Africa, the project will assess the implications of the growing involvement of the Rising Powers in Southern African energy systems for the affordability, accessibility and sustainability of energy services in the region and will analyse how the Rising Powers are shaping the provision of energy services for productive uses (e.g. cooking, lighting and mobility). The project also seeks to assess the implications for the wider governance of energy and climate change at the local, national, regional and global scales. Using a combination of semi-structured interviews and community-based participatory research methods the research will also explore the dynamics of the low carbon transitions being created and enabled by the Rising Powers in Southern Africa, which are uneven and differentiated technically, socially and spatially. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The likely beneficiaries include government, private and civil society organisations. It will be of relevance to international policy initiatives with which we have links, including the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership, the Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development, the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st century, the Clean Technology Fund of the World Bank, the South African Renewables Initiative and the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Programme for low income countries. It will also be of potential benefit to national, local and regional governments in China, Brazil, Mozambique and South Africa, and the UK as they seek to develop the low carbon transition alongside improving access to energy services in the region. We have established links with DECC and DfID to ensure that the research reaches these critical decisions makers, and will work with our partners to communicate our research findings to the Ministry of Mines and Energy (Brazil), the National Energy Commission (China), the Ministry of Energy (Mozambique), the Mozambique National Fund for Rural Electrification, the Department of Energy (South Africa), the South African National Energy Agency and the Southern Africa Development Community.

The project will be relevant to companies working in the energy sector (generation, infrastructure development, renewable energy technologies, energy suppliers), including those based in China and Brazil (e.g. Yingli Solar, LongYuan Power Group, Camargo Correa), Southern Africa (e.g. The Clean Energy Company, Electricidade de Mo&amp;ccedil;ambique, Eskom) and UK companies who may engage in the emerging market for renewable energy in the region (e.g. Renewable Energy Systems, Sun Biofuels). It will be of interest to civil society organisations concerned with achieving affordable, accessible low carbon energy services, including international organisations such as Practical Action, Oxfam, Action Aid and South African and Mozambican organisations suc as the Mozambican Action Group on Renewable Energies and Sustainable Development (GED), Sustainable Energy Africa and the Sustainable Energy Society of Southern Africa (SESSA). We have links with several of these organisations, and will seek to extend our as set out in our pathways to impact plan. We will specifically seek to engage with local communities through our participatory action research. Over the medium-long term, we expect the project will deliver the following principle benefits:

(1) Enhanced capacity to deliver the low carbon transition and affordable energy services in Southern Africa. The project will enhance capacity by: (a) developing the research capacity and skills of two leading organisations; (b) enhancing the knowledge base of a wide range of stakeholders operating in the region; (c) developing a community-based planning toolkit to realise the benefits of low carbon energy technologies in conjunction with development goals. 
(2) Contributing to improved energy service and investment decisions in Southern Africa. The project will create insights regarding appropriate technologies and business models for meeting the energy service needs of communities and ensuring a low carbon transition in Southern Africa. Given the rapid rate of growth of energy service needs, this has the potential to foster new forms of green growth in the region, which could have benefits to UK companies seeking to engage in this market. 
(3) Fostering effective policy-decisions for the international community and UK Government. Project findings will provide an indication of the potential synergies and conflicts between strategies for ensuring affordable energy services and for developing low carbon energy systems. It will also identify where the UK can add value and differentiate its contribution from other interventions in the region on these policy issues, contributing to the UK's strategic priority of realising low carbon transitions in developing economies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>582179</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Low Carbon Development - short course</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>745C0A0A-239D-466B-A70C-2581C85E2E42</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lucy Baker taught the three hour module on 'low carbon development' as part of a short course on climate change and development held at the University of East Anglia (UEA). This 2 week residential course is attended by professionals from multi-lateral and bi-lateral agencies, NGOs and government ministries from all over the world who seek to gain a greater understanding of the implications of climate change for developing countries and of the processes, issues and debates surrounding adaptation and mitigation. It is aimed at building the knowledge base of individuals who do not have an existing specialism in the field but who may have new responsibility or interest in the integration of climate change management into development planning, projects and policy.

With a particular focus on energy as a central component of low-carbon development, the module explored some of the key issues and tensions relating to low-carbon development, including: definitions of low-carbon development; financing; energy poverty; energy policy and political economy; and the contradictions between 'sustainable' and low-carbon development. Lucy Baker's presentation also drew on project case study materials from South Africa.

The module outline is as follows: 

&amp;quot;Emerging economies are widely regarded as driving global growth. With growing economic strength, these economies are being referred to increasingly as Emerging Powers with global importance and influence. For some, they bring new international development voices and perspectives, perhaps distinct from those of Western Powers. Emerging Powers are engaged on their own continuing development journey, wrestling with inequities and exclusion. They are also important international development actors. This module explores the development trajectories of the Emerging Powers and the international development implications.

Key questions considered in this module include:
 
&amp;middot; Where do the Emerging Powers fit within the field of development studies? 

&amp;middot; What can we explain and understand by 'development' as it is understood and practiced by these Powers? 

&amp;middot; What are the economic, social and political costs and benefits associated with the various development processes? 

&amp;middot; Where do these countries, as growing Powers, investors, consumers and donors engage with specific regional and global development regimes? 

This module seeks to develop a sound understanding of the domestic and international development issues central to the emergence of these Powers. It explores domestic development implications of their high-speed growth. The module assesses their impact upon trade and investment and growing role as international donors.

The challenges of rapidly scaling-up private investment flows into clean energy go hand in hand with the breadth of actors influencing the picture worldwide and the risk profiles of each. Thus many efforts have emerged to better understand, mitigate and manage risk profiles and the finance and policy gaps that contribute to them - in effect de-risking markets. 

REEEP, the Institute of Development Studies and ETH Zurich's Energy Politics Group co-hosted an official side event at the Paris COP21 to look at some of these ongoing efforts across the spectrum of stakeholders. 

Our project Co-I Professor Peter Newell was invited to speak at this event. His presentation sparked considerable debate and discussion afterwards about how best to scale up clean energy investment and we were able to feed the results of our research into this process.

The Mozambican power utility Electricidade de Mozambique (EDM) has expressed an interest in discussing with us in further detail our policy recommendations concerning rural electrification. This dialogue in ongoing. EDM are currently looking at ways to accelerate electrification and at the various models and management structures that will enable that and we have made all the results from our research available to them and have had a number of meetings and conversations with them about our recommendations going forward. EDM has also recently been awarded World Bank funding for a study about how best to accelerate the electrification process and we have been invited to contribute to this study and to participate in the process. We have also been working with the Fundo de Energia (FUNAE) in Mozambique (which forms part of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources) to share our research findings and policy recommendations concerning the use of renewable energy technologies in rural areas. Specifically, we have been discussing with FUNAE the role that such technologies can play in enhancing rural electrification and we have shared with them our evaluations of some of the rural energy projects that FUNAE has been running (based on the site visits we undertook in phase two of our field research). At present it is difficult to know with certainty what impact this will have on FUNAE's work but conversations with them are ongoing and we hope to arrange follow up visits to meet with FUNAE and EDM officials in Maputo in the coming months. In both cases our research is being used by these Mozambican state agencies in their attempts to develop and operationalise strategies that will help meet international commitments around extending sustainable energy access by 2030. 

The UK renewables company Videre Global have also requested copies of the project database and all our project outputs in developing their company strategy for entering the Mozambican market. The project PI has also been invited to participate in an UKTI trade delegation due to visit Mozambique in May 2016 in which Videre Global will be involved. The project PI has had a number of conversations and meetings with Videre about the current state of play around renewable energy in Mozambique and this has had a direct impact on the development of Videre's commercial strategy for the Mozambican market. 

We have also been working closely with the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (in Dutch: Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving - abbr. PBL). This is a research institute that advises the Dutch government on environmental policy and regional planning issues. PBL have recently been modelling different scenarios for energy futures in sub-Saharan Africa. Project Co-I's Harriet Bulkeley and Peter Newell attended and contributed to a PBL workshop in the Netherlands in September 2015 co-organised with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The workshop explored the roles of different actors in Africa's energy transition and we presented results from our research. In this sense our research has had (via PBL) an impact on the development of the Dutch government's international environmental policy in relation to Southern Africa and we feel that this is a very promising avenue for further developing the impact of our research.

We have also been working closely with three UK government agencies (Department of Energy and Climate Change, Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) to share our research findings and policy recommendations as they relate to Southern Africa and our two case study countries in particular but it is too early to say with certainty specifically what impact this has had on the work of these agencies. 

Finally the UK based NGO 'Practical Action' (who acted as a consultant partner on our project) have been using our research findings (specifically those relating to Mozambique) to develop their country strategy and to enhance their policy dialogue with the Mozambican government. Again it is too early to say with certainty what the impact of this will be in the medium to longer term. Practical Action have also produced a short film and a series of technical briefing papers that draw on our research which will in due course be hosted on their website. Again in the longer term we anticipate that this will impact on the work of the organisation as a whole but specifically on their work around enhancing sustainable energy access in Africa. 

Further updates on the development of these different pathways to impact will be provided in due course.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>51FCD62B-81FB-4AF4-8B99-3CA601CC09C1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project developed a new theoretical framework to systematically compare the roles that China, India and Brazil are playing in facilitating the transition to low carbon energy systems in Southern Africa by bringing together insights from diverse literatures on socio-technical transitions and the political economy of development. This consequently enabled us to develop a more dynamic understanding of the multiple drivers of renewable energy investments from the 'rising powers which, in the case of China, include excess domestic capacity, the domination of domestic markets by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the 'pull' of favourable policy environments in Southern Africa and the finance and support of agencies linked to government. This framework was informed by a database on 150 renewable energy projects in Southern Africa which explored the relationship between variables such as the roles of 'rising power' countries in different types of renewable energy projects, the scale of projects and levels of grid connectivity and the nature of financing and type of technology. 

We found that the 'rising powers' are not the determining or dominant actors in any low carbon development sector in either country and that attributing involvement or project ownership in renewable energy to any one 'rising power' can be problematic. Low carbon development in both countries encompasses a mix of stakeholders from the public and private, international and national, and political and economic spheres. Companies from 'rising power' economies are often bound up in wider networks of construction companies, renewable energy development companies, technology providers and national and international investment coalitions as renewable energy project finance and development is highly complex and shaped by global and transnational supply chains for technology. 

There are embryonic attempts in both Mozambique and South Africa to diversify the energy mix as well as increased interest on the part of 'rising powers' in investing in renewable technologies and infrastructures but there are concerns in both contexts as to who will benefit from the new investment. Progress with renewable energies in both countries has been inconsistent and often socially and spatially variable whilst remaining somewhat marginal to a fossil fuel based 'business as usual' trajectory. There is, however, no single regime or system in each county's energy transition. Instead there are multiple and fragmented regimes across which different forms of energy transition are unfolding. Low carbon transition remains low on the agendas of most actors in both countries and concerns about the need for cheap and secure energy (for export or domestic consumption), energy access, new technology markets and the need to satisfy local political priorities are more prominent. 

Problematically for policy, we found a mismatch between the way low carbon transitions are assumed to be emerging in the design of global policy instruments around technology, finance and carbon markets and the reality of how transitions are unfolding in Southern Africa where the key drivers of change lie beyond technology transfer or carbon markets, but do imply a key role for the state in generating and steering forms of public and private finance for its development needs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Project findings provide important insights for government and private sector organisations (both in the UK and in Southern Africa) regarding the appropriate technologies and business models which can provide the basis for meeting the energy service needs of communities and ensuring a low carbon transition in Southern Africa. In the UK, the research might be taken forward by government departments (principally DfiD, DECC and the FCO) with whom we have been in contact and UK businesses seeking to develop policy or investment strategies for Southern African energy systems. 

They are also useful for government and business actors in South Africa and Mozambique to inform thinking about how best to attract low carbon investments in ways which align with national development objectives. These include the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources or the National Fund for Rural Electrification (in Mozambique) or the Department of Energy (in South Africa) along with the national electricity utilities such as Electricidade de Mo&amp;ccedil;ambique (EdM) and Eskom (South Africa) given their central role in rural electrification strategies. Our research would provide these agencies with an indication of the potential synergies and conflicts between strategies for ensuring affordable energy services and for developing low carbon energy systems. 

Finally the findings will likely be taken forward by a number of national and international civil society organisations concerned with achieving affordable, accessible low carbon energy services, including international organisations such as Practical Action (a collaborating partner on the project).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8E06DD2E-B332-4CED-8B1B-830B2432D75F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and
