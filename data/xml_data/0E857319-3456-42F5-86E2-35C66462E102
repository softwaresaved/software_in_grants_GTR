approach</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L000776/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Research on 'key employees' and their effects on the firm is found across many academic disciplines, but remains fragmented and intellectually diffused, especially when discussing it within an industry specific management and mitigation research context. People risk may arise from the actions or behaviours of a person, or persons, due to inadequate/insufficient methods, processes, systems or controls to the detriment of strategic objectives. The consideration of people as an underlying cause of risk (now termed 'people risk') is deeply rooted in people being the most important asset in the firm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, in particular industries failures by 'key employees' (pilots, air traffic controllers, financial market traders, surgeons, train drivers, maritime captains) can have catastrophic economic, societal, and environmental consequences, thus creating a situation where employees can also be the most volatile liability in the firm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Through a number of one-day seminars 'Lessons in People Risk Management' aims to bring together academics, researchers, industry practitioners, government agencies and post graduate students from both domestic and international bodies to share experiences and generate new knowledge and perspectives about the management of 'people risk' within their own industries.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The fragmented nature of research and output in the area of 'people risk' has led to a silo based mentality to its management, this is reflected not only in academic research clusters but also within private bodies, organisations and regulators which suggest a lack of collective visibility and voice. The potential benefits of gathering multiple stakeholders across various backgrounds with the common theme of 'people risk' research in a seminar series will have synergistic academic, economic and societal impacts far beyond anything that exists for this purpose already. Moreover, the research interests and needs of discipline-based researchers, organisations, practitioners and relevant policy communities can be vastly different. The topics, participants and outputs of the seminar programme are designed to counter this fragmentation and better integrate knowledge and advocacy.

With this in mind the following constituencies will benefit:
1. UK national and local government agencies, including health, financial services, maritime, aviation, automotive:
The seminar series will enhance national government agencies such as National Rail, National Air Traffic Services, National Health Service and Financial Services Authority (all of which have expressed interest in participating), in the field through greater awareness of opportunities for cross-pollination of mitigation strategies and policies for 'people risk' which the seminar series will foster. The seminar series will also create a point of reference for research expertise in the area for UK non-academic government parties so as to influence evidence based policy making.

2. International agencies such as the US Department of Transport, European Central Bank, European Maritime Safety Agency, Bank for International Settlements, European Railway Agency
Given the international scope and nature of many of the industries detailed in the seminar series greater integration of knowledge and practice can have far reaching implications beyond UK national borders. Furthermore, the international locations involved in the seminar series itself will also support cross-border support for research and collaborations in policy development.

3. Industry practitioners
A process of reflective practice is common amongst practitioners of risk management, regardless of industry. Formal sources of knowledge on good practice is again diffuse, as such research on practices, processes and contexts can improve potential impacts by prompting reflective practice. This will have far reaching economic and societal impacts, for example had the lessons learnt from the internal failures of control in the UBS $2bn rogue trading incident been reflectively implemented in maritime policy could the Costa Concordia naval accident been averted. It is these questions that the seminar series seeks to explore, which has seen practitioner based agencies such as the Institute of Risk Management and the Chartered Institute of Securities and Investment support the seminar series concept wholeheartedly.

4. Funders of risk management research
Funding agencies will be able to access greater guidance on criteria of good practice by which to assess applications both from outputs of the seminar series and through the existence of a national network, particularly as the embryonic nature of this area of risk management research is set to grow considerably in the near future.

The following Learned Societies have been identified as collaborators/supporters of the programme, and each will be presented with progress and outcomes of the seminar series:
British Academy
Institute of Chartered Accountants England and Wales (&amp;amp; Scotland)
British Psychological Society
National Institute for Health Research
Marie Curie Actions Programme
Health Foundation
The Leverhulme Trust
Association of Medical Research Charities
Lighthill Risk Network

The inclusion of industry representatives as key stakeholders within the seminar series created multiples opportunities for the academic research presented to be translated into information that could be considered more applicable to their operational needs. Examples of this can be seen in the debates that took place in our final seminar at 'The Willis Building' London in which the application of aviation checklists and cockpit process was considered within the investment banking 'People Risk' exposures of one of our industry based delegates. 

In order to ensure we maximised our potential for impact out with the academic universe we held two seminars outside of university property (International Financial Services Centre Dublin and Willis Building London). This ensured that we minimised the opportunity costs attending our seminars whilst allowing them to interact with academic research in an environment that they are more familiar with.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2249CBAB-E2F5-4791-8B5A-43786D449319</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The 'Lessons in People Risk Management' seminar series aimed to bring together academics, researchers, industry practitioners, government agencies and post graduate students from both domestic and international bodies to share experiences and generate new knowledge and perspectives about the management of 'People Risk' within their own industries. There was no identifiable research network that connects research in this area in the UK, or internationally for that matter. The series achieved this through a number of one-day seminars held in England, Scotland, Germany, Slovenia, and the Republic of Ireland, whilst focusing upon the following central research questions:

1. What are the new discourses driving the management of 'people risk', are they the same across sectors, are they aware of the existence of each other, and how do they complement/conflict with each other? 
2. Are particular 'people risk' management techniques and practices preferred?
3. What are the consequences of multi-disciplinary implementation of techniques and practices for the management of 'people risk'?
4. What is the multi-disciplinary evidence for the fundamental underlying reasons for the occurrence of 'people risk'?
5. How far can academic disciplines within and between sectors learn from each other and what can they learn?

Within the seminar series, through both research presented, debates with delegates, an online discussion it became apparent that different industries encountered almost all the same fundamental problems with 'people risk'. Intriguingly, these similarities did not guarantee knowledge exchange or learning between industry representatives or academic disciplines, particularly in the application of methodologies to measure and assess 'people risk'. For example, Steven Shorrock (EUROCONTROL) presented an overview of the information gaps that lie between industry practice and academic research. This presentation and the subsequent debates that were generated around it led to the development of a new network of policy makers (WHO, Institute of Risk Management, European Food Safety Authority), practitioners (Google, M&amp;amp;G Investments, Eurocontrol,) and academics who are keen to ensure that the new generation of academics are much more closely aligned with industry. Anecdotal evidence throughout the seminar series and online discussion highlighted a lack of opportunities for Early Career Risk Researchers (ECRR) to engage with industry. In an attempt to ensure these information gaps are reduced the network (led by the PI Cormac Bryce) submitted a British Academy Rising Stars Engagement Award (2016) aimed specifically to address these issues with ECRR engagement. Further evidence of the success of the seminar series can be evidenced in the use of the online videos and research material internationally as learning resources for both the academic and non-academic communities. 

The overarching intention of this project has always been to create an environment for the effective sharing of inter-disciplinary experience, research, and knowledge between those who may not necessarily engage on the topic of 'people risk' frequently (academics, PhD students, journal editors, funders, policymakers, regulators, public/private bodies). With this in mind the research team and the members of subsequent networks, and partnerships that have been created because of it consider the project to have been a resounding success.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The development of a virtual centre of expertise (dedicated website, social media, media outreach, learning resources) and network of engaged participants has allowed for the crossover of research into practice. This has been evidenced by a number of seminar speakers being invited to present their findings after seminars to industry representative's within their company offices. The outcomes of this research project have been further strengthened from an academic perspective by the recent acquisition of a special issue in the Journal of Risk Research in the winter of 2016 dedicated to topics under consideration within the seminar series. It is the intention of the team to ensure we have a blend of papers within the special edition including commentaries by prominent industry stakeholders, eight to ten research papers including PhD student's contributions, and an editorial summarising the edition and the outcomes of the seminar series more generally. The team has been very careful to ensure PhD student participation within the seminar series with bursaries for each of the seminars being received very well by the postgraduate cohort. This has been reinforced by the application for additional funding to bridge the gap between early career risk researchers and industry practice.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>97898453-AD6A-4C51-94BD-3B677397FB03</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Energy,Financial Services, and Management
