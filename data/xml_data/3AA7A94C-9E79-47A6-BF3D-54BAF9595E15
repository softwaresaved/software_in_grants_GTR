Prison Visitation and Recidivism in the UK.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K002023/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>In the aftermath of the 2011 UK riots, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke described the rioters as a 'feral underclass, cut off from the mainstream', and blamed the riots on the 'broken penal system - one whose record in preventing reoffending has been straightforwardly dreadful'.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reoffending or recidivism is key to the operation of the repetitive cycle of incarceration, reentry,re-offending and re-incarceration, and represents a major policy challenge. In the UK, 75 per cent of ex-inmates reoffend within nine years of release, and 39.3 per cent within the first twelve months.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Clarke's solution as set out in the government's &amp;quot;Breaking the Cycle&amp;quot; Green Paper is 'payment by results'; a 'radical and decentralising reform' with 'freedom to innovate' new interventions, opening 'the market to new providers from the private, voluntary and community sectors'.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project draws attention to prison visitation as an aspect of imprisonment which has already been demonstrated to improve the outcomes of released prisoners, but whose specific functionality is at present poorly understood. Through parallel methodologies, this project investigates the relationship between visitation and recidivism.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The timely focus of this project on the highly topical issue of reoffending will make a demonstrable contribution to society and the economy. Coinciding with active government consultation on and development of policy towards reoffending, it will assist in increasing; 

(1) the effectiveness of public services and policy, by improvement of the effectiveness and sustainability of public, private and third sector organisations around prisoner rehabilitation;

(2) enhancement of social welfare, social cohesion and quality of life, by reducing recidivism and therefore delivering the social benefits associated with fewer victims of crime; 

(3) the economic competitiveness of the UK, by helping reduce the estimated &amp;pound;7-10billion annual cost of reoffending to the UK economy (through reduced demand on the criminal justice system, fewer court cases, reduced legal aid spending, fewer Community Orders, fewer Suspended Sentences and fewer Custodial Sentences; reductions in acquisitive crime which could benefit businesses; and reduced violent crime which could deliver financial savings to other government departments such as the Department of Health).

This economic and societal impact will be Instrumental (influencing the development of policy, practice and service provision and altering behaviour towards recidivism); and Conceptual (contributing to the understanding of policy issues and reframing current debates around this issue). 

The research is timed to coincide with the development of relevant policy issues. The UK Coalition Government's Ministry of Justice published the Green Paper 'Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders' in December 2010, and the 'Breaking the Cycle: Government Response' to consultation in May 2011, and to complement the drive to identify effective interventions to reduce recidivism by the end of the Spending Review period 2014/15. 

Beneficiaries will be the UK Ministry of Justice, National Offender Managment Service and HMP Hewell, as well as organisations working with prisoners' families and providing interventions aimed at reducing recidivism, such as 'Partners of Prisoners' and 'Action for Prisoners' Families' (members of which are part of an Advisory Group to the project). These organisations will be direct users of this research in developing their core areas of activity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288952</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Northern Ireland Prison Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Northern Ireland Prison Service</gtr:description><gtr:id>90CCE8F7-48F7-479F-85C5-F37C2C33950A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>to be determined</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Enabling research access to prisons in Northern Ireland, and to headquarters of the NIPS.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>1) the co-production of research to address the strategic priorities of the NIPS in relation to visitation and reoffending, i.e. qualitative work around prisoner/staff/visitor experiences of visitation at prison sites in Northern Ireland.

For example, the PI reviews for the Ministry of Justice Analytical Services, and we have advised the Ministry of Justice in relation to their proposals for a new online booking service for prison visits.

Through ESRC Impact Acceleration Awards at the University of Birmingham, we have provided applied academic advice for the Northern Ireland Prisons Service, in relation to family contact and visitation, with a view to assisting them with reducing reoffending.

Further direct advice on improving the effectiveness of prison visitation has been provided to the National Offender Management Service in relation to: the design of new prisons in England and Wales to 2020; the provision of an electronic visits booking service for prisons in England and Wales; and the design and operation of visiting spaces for the HMP Holme House and Kirklevington Grange Reform Prisons, and HMP Berwyn.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F693747-D444-472D-9A42-1132E4F8E16F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant investigated the relationship between prison visitation and reoffending, specifically, looking at the characteristics of visitation that encourage its apparent effect on reducing reoffending post-custody. As part of the research a portfolio of research methodologies was developed to investigate both the statistical relationship between visitation and reoffending, and qualitative measures to explore the effects of the socio-spatial context of visitation. 
A significant new research dataset was generated, comprising: statistical information collected from prisoners at the case study prison who were approaching release, and in-depth interviews with prisoners, visitors and prison staff which focused on experiences of prison visitation. The purpose of the quantitative dataset is to enable the relationship between prison visitation and reoffending (i.e. the effect that visitation has on reoffending rates post-custody) to be established. The purpose of the qualitative dataset is to enhance understanding of the lived experience of visitation from the perspective of prisoners and their visitors, and the prison personnel who manage the visits process.
Issues of research access to the intended case study prison caused an unavoidable delay in commencing data generation, which meant that the data-matching of statistical data to the Police National Computer (enabled via a data sharing agreement between the University of Birmingham and the Ministry of Justice) will now take place after the end date of the funded project. However, the qualitative data has already contributed to significant research impact activities, notably with the Northern Ireland Prison Service, and at a number of individual prisons in the UK from whose senior management teams advice has been requested. 
As a direct result of the project, a new research collaboration was established, between the University of Birmingham and the Northern Ireland Prison Service. A secondment of a PostDoctoral Research Assistant employed on the project to the NIPS was funded through an ESRC Impact Acceleration Award at the University of Birmingham. This new collaboration led to the generation of a new dataset pertaining to visitation within the NI Prison system, and to direct advice to the NIPS in relation to their strategic aim to transform custody in that context.
The success of the research project depended on the cross-disciplinary research team. Although the co-I (in Psychology) had to withdraw from the project to take an academic position overseas, the collaboration between human geography and criminology was extremely productive, and led directly to interdisciplinary publications and research dissemination, as well as to significant career advancement for the two Early Career Researchers appointed in succession to the PostDoctoral Research Assistant position.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings are disseminated via a range of presentations (both at academic conferences and to practitioner groups) publications already published, accepted or under review in a range of journals, as well as a major new edited collection, Handbook on Prison and The Family invited by Palgrave for their Criminology Series on the basis of the conduct of this research project. 
This handbook advances scholarship by providing a comprehensive view of the most current research in this area, with chapters written by scholars both established and early-career, from numerous and diverse disciplines; ranging from law, nursing, criminology, psychology, human geography, and education studies. Further, contributions will span various methodological and epistemological approaches with important contributions from Non-Governmental organisations working in this area at a national and supra-national level. As well as highlighting the rarely-heard voices of such professionals who work with this group, what also makes this handbook distinctive is the consideration of members of prisoners' families often 'missing' from a literature which tends to focus on the female partners and children of prisoners; for example, the inclusion of work on the male partners of female prisoners and mothers of prisoners. 
It is anticipated that this handbook will make a significant contribution to knowledge about who prisoners' families are and what this status means in practice. Importantly it will also recognise the autonomy and value of prisoners' families as a research subject in their own right, not just as an adjunct to the prisoner. This multi-faceted approach will ensure that the handbook does justice to the complexities around who constitutes this nebulous and often hidden group and their most pressing issues. In this respect, it could be deemed an introductory text in a broad sense however, contributions will draw on high quality, often empirical research, which will go beyond mere description and engage critically with the topic. 
Academic findings have already informed advice provided to the Northern Ireland Prison Service, and to the senior management teams of individual prisons in the UK, and to the National Offender Management Service.
Evidence arising from the project has also been provided to the Farmer Review.
