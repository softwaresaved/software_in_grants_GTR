Yet whilst the situations in which these officials use firearms, and the effects of this use, are relatively well documented and understood, this is not the case with 'less lethal' weapons and 'less lethal' force. (For the purposes of this project, less lethal force, or LLF, includes the use of restraints, empty hand techniques and less lethal weapons. The latter are weapons, such as the electric-shock Taser, pepper spray or batons, intended to subdue or incapacitate rather than cause serious harm or death). 

There is a recognition amongst academics and practitioners alike that this needs to change. Internationally, the current UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions has expressed the need for more research into LLF, as has the UN Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture. Nationally, a recent article in Forensic Science and Medical Pathology called for research into, and better reporting of, less lethal force in the UK, as did the Experts' Meeting on Taser the PI convened in 2015 with ESRC funds. The National Police Chief's Council (NPCC) and College of Policing have stressed the pressing need for research into LLF, and the Home Secretary has called for more information on police use of less lethal force and has launched a review into Use of Force Reporting (the 'Reporting Review'). 

At least three key topics around less lethal weapons remain under-researched, and this project will tackle all three directly. First we lack a basic understanding of when, why, on whom, and how often, less lethal weapons are used - and whether certain groups of people (those of a particular gender, ethnic minority, mental health status or geographical origin) are more or less likely to have less lethal force used on them. This project will see the PI work closely with the National Police Chief's Council, the Home Office and UK police forces, utilizing datasets previously unavailable to academic researchers to answer such questions. Such issues are also relevant internationally, as shown by recent debates on police less lethal force in countries as varied as Armenia, Hungary and New Zealand. 

Second, whilst these weapons are associated with saving lives, they have also been associated with serious injuries and fatalities. In the UK alone, several high profile deaths-including that of Ian Tomlinson and Jordan Begley-have occurred following police use of less lethal weapons. There are key questions around how so called less lethal force can impact the right to life, and their association with fatalities worldwide. Building on my PhD work focusing on injuries associated with Taser, this project will see the PI work with the UN Special Rapporteur to research the impact less lethal force has on the right to life in the UK and globally. 

Third, if it is important to attend to the situations in which force is used, it is also important to look at how such force is monitored and governed. This requires working with police and government to help understand what data on less lethal force should be gathered and analyzed, and working with the independent oversight bodies that monitor places of detention (including police custody) to ensure that they have the necessary research to enable them to document the LLF used by state authorities. The UN Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture has highlighted the need for research to assist them in addressing and monitoring less lethal weapons and other physical infrastructure found in places of detention. The PI will work with key decision makers on these issues; with the UK government on reporting, and with oversight bodies via the SPT and its network of over 40 national bodies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries are split into UK &amp;amp; international for clarity,though in reality they are closely connected.

UK beneficiaries: 
1) Individuals (100s of thousands) who have been or will be subjected to or affected by less lethal force (LLF), lawyers &amp;amp; UK NGOs Amnesty International &amp;amp; Omega Research Foundation. The latter has been involved in the development of the proposal, via a meeting to discuss bid content, and I have interviewed the former to understand their concerns. NGOs will benefit from a better understanding of circumstances in which LLF is used and why rates of Taser use vary - topics they lack capacity to research but note need more work. The research on UK LLF, the first of its kind, will deepen understanding of issues &amp;amp; good practice in the UK by providing new evidence, ensuring they are able to make informed decisions about where advocacy is needed. They will also benefit from meetings with civil society, academics &amp;amp; the civil service which will provide a safe space for them to exchange knowledge and benefit from research findings. 

2) UK civil servants (incl. the NPCC, Home Office) will benefit via the PI's participation in the Use of Force Reporting Review, included at their request. Specifically they will benefit from i) research capacity &amp;amp; ii) insights into best practice from a social science perspective, including the need to capture certain variables.
 
3) UK police decision-makers &amp;amp; police officers will benefit from the PI's work on the reporting review, a crucial step towards the potential creation of a nationwide reporting system. The research the PI conducts on this system and/or on in-house force data will help answer crucial questions about LLF in the UK. Depending on findings it is anticipated to lead to changes in training (eg changes to techniques), police practice (eg deployment) &amp;amp; will promote evidence based policing. 

Global beneficiaries:
4) The UN Special Rapporteur &amp;amp; team, who have been involved in this proposal by suggesting the work on LLF and right to life, will benefit through co-produced research in an area of long-standing concern. They will also benefit from the provision of an evidence base around the impact of LLF on the right to life which will help them push their recent call to the UN Human Rights Council for an expert body on this subject.

5) The UN Subcommittee on Torture Prevention (SPT), who have been involved in this proposal by suggesting the inclusion of co-produced research into standards for the use of non-human actors (including LLF) in detention &amp;amp; a manual on their documentation. Specifically, this will assist the SPT to i) conduct their own visits to places of detention &amp;amp; ii) to advise their network of over 40 monitoring bodies on their own visits, filling a gap in detention monitoring worldwide and helping to ensure rights of detainees.

6) Individuals who have been or will be subjected to or affected by LLF &amp;amp; legal representatives, NGOs &amp;amp; campaigners (Campaign Zero, Amnesty, Assoc. for Prevention of Torture), will benefit 3 ways. First they will gain insights into i) issues &amp;amp; good practice around LLF based on the UK experience, which will be applicable more broadly &amp;amp; ii) the connection between less lethal weapons and the right to life, both of which will help strengthen the evidence base for advocacy in their own countries. Second, they will use the manual in their own work, helping them report more effectively on the (ab)use of LLF. Third their advocacy on the creation of an international body on LLF will be strengthened by the PI's work.

7) Civil servants &amp;amp; police forces globally (incl. in Canada, USA, Netherlands, where the PI is linked) will benefit from a better understanding of issues &amp;amp; good practice around LLF in the UK &amp;amp; its implications. This, combined with an understanding of how LLF impacts the right to life &amp;amp; standards for LLF in detention will help them make decisions around which LLF to introduce and their regulation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157689</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N016564/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
