If harnessed on earth, it could provide limitless low-carbon energy. The basic fuel - the Deuterium and Tritium (D&amp;amp;T) forms of heavy hydrogen, are either readily available in sea-water, or can be 'bred' from the abundant element Lithium (the element in a mobile phone battery). The primary nuclear waste products are harmless - the main being helium (an alpha particle), an inert gas found in party balloons. This all sounds too good to be true - and in a sense it is - because getting the reaction to occur is incredibly difficult - because pushing the D and T close together such that the strong force causes them to bind takes a lot of energy (they repel as they are positively charged nuclei). Getting them to move fast enough so that when by chance they have a head-on collision and get close enough to fuse corresponds to heating them to 100 million K. Confining such a hot plasma for long enough for the collisions to occur is no mean feat. There are two approaches: the first uses a magnetic bottle to keep a low density gas away from the walls of a container. As the density is low, collisions take several seconds - this is the magnetic fusion approach. The second idea uses lasers irradiating a small spherical balloon containing the heavy hydrogen. The laser heats the outside of the balloon from different directions, creating a hot plasma that expands into the vacuum, and then, like a spherical rocket, the shell moves towards the centre, compressing the heavy hydrogen to high temperatures and densities 100s of times denser than ordinary liquid. No magnetic fields are needed, because owing to the high density, the collisions are very rapid, and although the compressed miniature sun will expand again (and blow up more quickly if fusion takes place), the reaction occurs faster than the explosion itself - the material is confined by its own inertia. This is called inertial confinement fusion. In current studies at the National Ignition Facility in California, this goal is close to being realised. However, at present there are still problems to be overcome. One of the major ones is that the shell does not compress uniformly, and it is known that if the implosion is not close to being perfectly spherical, then any ripples will grow, breaking up the wall of the shell before the peak of the implosion. The shell of the balloon then mixes into the fuel, and starts to 'glow' due to the high temperatures, and cools the system, preventing fusion. Therefore, two interlinked problems need to be tackled - firstly, we need to find out how much of the shell is mixing into the heavy hydrogen core - and secondly we need to work out how to prevent this happening (either by making better targets, or illuminating the sphere more uniformly). This research grant addresses the first measurement problem. For various physics reasons the shell of the balloon contains some heavy elements (particularly Germanium) which, if they mix into the hot core, 'light-up' and emit characteristic X-ray lines. From a study of the absolute and relative brightness of these lines, it is possible to gain information on the temperature of the material, and of the density, and also, of the amount of the shell that has mixed into the core. Some of this work has already been performed by our US colleagues. However, at present the technique is not quite accurate enough to say if the amount that has mixed in is really enough to extinguish the reaction. The Oxford and York groups in the UK here put forward several new ideas to improve the theory and experimental technique to a point where we believe we will be able to say if the mix level is acceptable. These ideas are based on a new high resolution x-ray instrument, novel spectroscopic theory looking at the brightness of X-rays from different elements, and by performing sophisticated full 3 dimensional simulations of the emission process.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research outlined in this proposal has potential impact in both the short and the long-term. In the short-term, the impact should be to aid all those workers, both government and academic, working in the field of inertial confinement fusion, as the work plays an important part in the overall goal of achieving fusion in the laboratory. It is also the case that the techniques and methods developed, of high resolution X-ray spectroscopy in high energy density matter, will be of direct relevance to our UK colleagues working at AWE, performing research of application to the UK's Nuclear Deterrent. Additionally, the project will have impact in the training and development of skills in laser-plasma interactions in general, and ICF in particular. This project will utilise the multi-terrawatt National Ignition Facility (NIF) - the world's most powerful laser, and the only laser system in the world capable of producing fusion gain. The Oxford based postdoc, and York-based student working on this project will thus gain a unique set of skills. At present no UK young researcher has experience of a single NIF shot - a situation that cannot continue if the UK is to have a credible stance towards ICF and Inertial Fusion Energy. We believe that the UK needs to invest in the training of the next generation of scientists who will be the users of such laser sources, and the developers of IFE if fusion proves viable. We note that during the timescale of this project there is every expectation that NIF will indeed achieve ignition and fusion energy gain. While the consequences of this are hard to judge in advance, the high-power laser community in the UK and Europe are fully expecting a strong push for laser fusion energy to follow. This has been given recent impetus by the memorandum of understanding signed by the UK between AWE and LLNL to facilitate technical exchanges which could lead to the design, development and deployment of power plants based on laser fusion energy. Having young researchers directly trained in the use of the technology such as NIF will undoubtedly increase the UK's impact in this new field. Furthermore, the proposal is in keeping with the RCUK's policy as set out in the document &amp;quot;A 20-year Vision for the UK Contribution to Fusion as an Energy Source &amp;quot;. This policy states that the role for the UK in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) over the next 20 years is strongly tied to what happens at the NIF, and that the UK's approach would be most effective if this were to develop into a global collaboration to develop a plan to exploit NIF ignition towards fusion energy. Finally, the fullest impact of this work, global in nature, would reveal itself if fusion is indeed realised, and can one day be made into a viable energy source. The ramifications of such a step forward in energy technology are difficult to overstate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>469037</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5C58FFBA-D42E-4E4F-894F-B26AEF9511AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public lecture to help promote the Exhibition at the Oxford Museum of the History of Science.

This material can stop the fusion reaction. Therefore diagnosing how much material mixes in is important to improve performance. By measuring the spectrum of x-rays emitted by the material mixed in the core we can determine how much mixing took place. The refinement of our models also shows that we can glean a lot of information about the temperature and density conditions prevalent in the system - all of which impact on the overall performance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As we understand mix better, targets could be designed to prevent it.
