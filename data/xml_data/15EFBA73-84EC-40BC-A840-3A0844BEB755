consumption for Brazil in the context of climate change mitigation strategies</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N002504/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The collaborative research project combines the qualitative and quantitative research capabilities of the University of Cambridge, the Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina, and the Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo to analyse the linkages between energy, food and water consumption for Brazil, in the context of climate change mitigation strategies.

This project concerns developing a mid- to long-term research programme for the study of technically and legally feasible configurations of the Brazilian energy and agriculture sector in close collaboration between the UK and Brazilian partners. This project will revolve around the use of the technology and decision diffusion model methodology Future Technology Transformations (FTT), under development in Cambridge by a team of 4 researchers led Dr. J.-F. Mercure, along with the global macroeconometric model E3ME (www.e3me.com). This capacity will be linked to an internationally leading research team headed by Prof. Vinuales on political and legal analysis of energy and sustainable development policy. Among subjects of interest will be freshwater and land use changes in relation to the energy and agricultural sectors, using both the FTT modules for the energy and agricultural sectors (FTT:Power, FTT:Agriculture). The targeted analysis will include local and international food demand, trade, as well as changes in employment generated by the development of low-carbon innovations and the diffusion of new technology in both the energy and agriculture sectors. While FTT is operated by the University of Cambridge, E3ME is maintained, operated and developed by Cambridge Econometrics Ltd, who will be in charge of training the Brazilian researchers in the use of the platform E3ME-FTT.

Through detailed analysis of the legal and governance contexts and their cross-sectoral impacts, the project will examine actual and prospective mitigation policies for Brazil, facilitated through close collaboration with local experts, most notably from the PUC-SP, with insights into the local challenges and opportunities. The active collaboration and the development of local analysis capabilities will provide support for capacity-building and knowledge-sharing. Enhanced understanding of the interactions between environmental and societal actions in analysed policies for Brazil could strengthen the generic basis for integration of climate action in the broader development agenda of the country.

A significant part of this networking project aims at building new research capacity, through the exchange of computational tools and training, to researchers from Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina and Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo, who are actively involved in engaging local policy-makers. They will learn how to use the computational platforms E3ME-FTT developed in Cambridge to study specific locally relevant issues of energy, food and water linkages for Brazil, and help devise insight relevant for policy-making. Meanwhile, the Brazilian partners will provide invaluable contextual knowledge on locally relevant issues such that the research has relevance for policy-making, which could impact livelihoods in rural areas and low-income communities.

The activities of this networking project can be divided into six main categories:
(1.) Coordination Meetings (2.) International Conference (3.) Training (4.) Publications (5.) Network (6.) Public Awareness
The expected result of this networking project is to design a strong and coherent consortium of researchers covering all relevant aspects of the Energy-Water-Food nexus in the context of climate change mitigation policy in Brazil: sustainable development (economics, energy, agriculture) modelling and case studies, environmental policy and law, and a strong connection to networks in Brazil in order to ensure sustained impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The activities of this networking project will be divided into six main categories, of which the contribution to impact is summarised as follows:

(1.) Coordination Meetings: Three meetings will be held between the participating universities to monitor the progression of project objectives, one in Brazil and two in Cambridge. For one of the meetings in Cambridge, policy makers from the EU related to Brazil will be invited to participate, in order to use their expertise as a valuable input for the project, as well as to maximise the impact of it, providing policy relevant outcome. For the meeting in Brazil, several authorities, policy makers and key decision-makers from the private sector will be invited to participate as well. This will serve as a backbone to the project's intended extensive networking and link-building activities across the range of existing and potential stakeholders.

(2.) International Conference: An additional international conference will be organised by the University of Cambridge, the Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina and the PUC-SP with the main objective of discussing about the current situation in Brazil regarding energy, food and water usage, availability and linkages. The conference will take place in Brazil and it be divided in the following areas:
- Theme 1: Brazil and its current energy, food and water use and availability. 
- Theme 2: Technological change of the Brazilian energy sector, and its impact on land use changes, food, water and greenhouse gas emissions.
- Theme 3: Policy responses to energy, food and water conflicting demand.
- Theme 4: Engagement with policymakers to ensure policy relevance in Brazil. 
Key decision-makers and academics working on these areas will be invited to participate in the conference. Important links are expected to be developed, with the purpose of creating a long-term network between the research centres in the UK and Brazil and local policy-makers.

(3.) Training: The University of Cambridge in partnership with Cambridge Econometrics will train the Brazilian researchers in the use of the modelling platform E3ME-FTT. This will result in sustained built analytical capacity that, with the help of the network built during the project, will enable to analyse complex environmental policy issues in Brazil beyond the end of this project's duration.

(4.) Publications: Following the international conference and the meetings, a set of publications will be presented to disseminate and promote the knowledge and information related to climate change mitigation strategies and sustainable management of energy, food and water in Brazil analysed in this project.

(5.) Network: The collaboration between Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina, the PUC-SP and the University of Cambridge established with this project will enable a research network to be formed. This will involve Brazilian researchers going to Cambridge to study the modelling platforms and methods, and, vice versa, Cambridge researchers going to Santa Catarina and Sao Paulo to study the implementation of renewable energies systems and energy efficiency projects in rural areas focus on the promotion of regional and rural development. 

(6.) Public Awareness: In order to increase the awareness about the importance of the efficient use of energy, food and water resources, multimedia content will be produced and distributed. The target audience for this information will be policy makers, local authorities, universities and public schools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>46372</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Radboud University Nijmegen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>BRIDGE team, Newton Fund project</gtr:description><gtr:id>FA21252F-1B76-43C8-B8AF-EAFC042C481B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project started with a Kick-off meeting at the end of April 2016.

We have used this collaboration as a base to form a consortium for applying for Horizon 2020 funding of ?5M and 20 partners across the world. Our proposal passed the first stage, and the full proposal was submitted in Sept. 2014, and scored highly on the second round. Following this, we were successful with a Newton Fund/ESRC bid for &amp;pound;800, in collaboration with partners in Brazil, for application of this model to the Brazilian Energy-Water-Food nexus. This project will start in the spring 2016. 
We submitted a paper on stranded fossil fuel assets, which is currently under review in the journal Nature.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Cambridge Econometrics contributes a global macroeconometric model E3ME, used to calculate the demand for energy and emissions intensive services, which are simulated by our models of technology.
The Open University contributes emulators of the climate system (PLASIM-ENTSem), of the carbon cycle (GENIEem) and of land use (LPJem). These enable to evaluate climate change as a result of emissions trajectories calculated using the combined models E3ME-FTT. 
Cambridge University contributes expertise in international law, governance and policy, and methods for strategic policy-making.
The combination of these components enables to evaluate impacts assessments from the policies to their environmental impacts with the evolution of the global economy. It is arguably the most advanced IAM that currently exists, the only one simulation-based. The method is described in our recent collaborative publication Mercure et al. 2016.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Three institutions (U. Cambridge, Cambridge Econometrics, the Open University and Radboud University) agreed to join their expertise to build a new beyond the state of the art Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) for evaluating the impacts of environmental policies and advising policy-making. In this, I (Radboud U.) contribute computational models of technology diffusion in transport and the electricity sector, the Future Technology Transformations system (FTT:Power and FTT:Transport), as well as decision-making in agriculture and bioenergy. This will simulate the diffusion of new technologies and account for fuel use greenhouse gas emissions from those technologies.

However, the activities that we have carried out are likely to result in significant impact beyond academic research. The most important of these will most likely be related to engagement of non-academic spheres of Brazilian society. The second will likely be related to capacity building in Brazil for policy analysis. The third will relate to a strengthened collaboration between the UK and Brazil for the development of the science-policy interface in order to identify potential future issues and opportunities in relation to the Energy-Water-Food nexus.

The primary impact relates to engagement in Brazil, which we carried out with a relatively large conference, organised in Florianololis at the end of August 2015, to which many academics, policy-makers, students and members of the public participated. The EWF nexus visibly engages highly all spheres of population in Brazil, on which a debate is emerging. Indeed, Brazil faces many challenges in this regard. Thus our efforts at structuring the debate in scientific and policy-engagement terms has been well received. We have met with various regional policy-makers to discuss climate change, water, energy and agricultural issues. We were awarded with the traditional Florianopolis Hercilio Luz Bridge trophy by Florianopolis municipality in recognition of our efforts at starting a science-policy dialogue. We will carry this dialogue forward through the BRIDGE project.

The second impact related to our training activities with Brazilians on UK methods, models and software to use for policy analysis in Brazil. This was successful and gave a good foundation to our capacity building efforts, which will be carried forward further through the BRIDGE project.

Finally, the collaboration between the UK and Brazil was taken forward significantly by developing a strong collaboration, which will now be established for the long term. This platform will enable us, through the BRIDGE project, to engage firmly with policy-makers, academics and the public, in matters relating to environmental policy, climate change, economics and the EWF nexus.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DF8BCDF8-8D9A-4E26-8B7D-3E1B2B0E93F8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Under this networking grant, we have developed a consortium of scientists and academics that enabled to carry out research on the Energy-Water-Food (EWF) Nexus in Brazil and beyond. The primary objective of this project was to first develop the consortium for research in order to develop more extensive research projects and grant applications. The second was to carry out capacity-building and engagement activities in Brazil, and third, to carry out some preliminary research in the area of the EWF nexus in Brazil.

The first objective was met more than satisfactorily, as the emerging consortium has been highly successful with a further, extensive, grant proposal, under the Newton Fund, to study the EWF nexus as a research project over three years, built upon this networking grant LINKS2015. The successful bid, as a continuation of LINKS2015, has been called BRIDGE (Building Resilience In a Dynamic Global Economy: Complexity across scales in the Brazilian Food-Water-Energy Nexus), involves four institutions and has a total value of over &amp;pound;800k, funds managed by the ESRC (Project no ES/N013174/1, starting date not determined yet). Based on this we consider the LINKS2015 project successful.

The second objective was one of capacity building in Brazil, both for academics and non-academics, which we have successfully carried out with a conference (in Brazil) and two training events for Brazilians (one in Brazil, one in the UK) using UK modelling and policy analysis tools. This has resulted in a highly consolidated team. One meeting is left to carry out, planned to take place shortly, in which the project will be concluded with further engagement in Brazil, coinciding with the kick-off meeting of the new BRIDGE project.

The third objective was to carry out research in relation to the policy analysis that we wished to carry out beyond LINKS. This has been successful with the elaboration, by the group, of a new approach for managing the science-policy interface, by using dynamical models and highly robust uncertainty analysis, as proposed in the BRIDGE project. The BRIDGE methodology was formalised in a high impact publication in the journal Global Environmental Change (Mercure et al. 2016). Further publications are underway in collaboration between the UK and Brazilian groups, which will likely be published after the project ends.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings in our methodology publication (Mercure 2016) will likely be taken forward by the climate change modelling and policy analysis community, as well as by our own consortium during the BRIDGE project, in order to improve significantly the amount of policy-relevant insight that can be derived from dynamical models with uncertainty analysis, as opposed to current methods. Recent developments in the climate change mitigation and environmental policy analysis fields indicate how current methods, including for example cost-benefit analysis and equilibrium economic methods, can be limiting for analyses that involve dynamic change. For example, current methods preclude studying issues of green growth arising from investment in low-carbon or efficiency improving technology. This current bottleneck can be released using the methodology that we propose, as we hope to demonstrate in our new collaborative BRIDGE project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5C865A68-82DC-480C-94CF-D060D7BDBF1E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/601D0B64-83DE-4354-A994-23DB6B7BF3F5"><gtr:id>601D0B64-83DE-4354-A994-23DB6B7BF3F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modelling complex systems of heterogeneous agents to better design sustainability transitions policy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Global Environmental Change</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/08d73f38084e701464b7eac7ce603b3a"><gtr:id>08d73f38084e701464b7eac7ce603b3a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mercure J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N002504/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AECBB1F8-45A7-48B4-9FBB-31FE4206AA69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban &amp; Land Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
