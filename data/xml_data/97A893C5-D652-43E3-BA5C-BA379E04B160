The ambition is to share case studies, findings and improve knowledge of best practice regarding how best to build empathic processes. 

Crime, conflict and ineffective delivery of justice detract from the quality of individual/collective life, disrupting social cohesion. One response has been RJ. This brings those harmed by crime or conflict, and those responsible for the harm, into direct communication, enabling all affected to engage in empathetic processes that play a part in repairing harm to find a positive way forward. RJ lets victims tell offenders the real impact of their crime, get answers, receive an apology and get on with their lives. It also lets offenders understand and take responsibility. RJ has some elements in common with co-creation and participatory approaches employed in design, as well as those delivered via performance studies within the criminal justice system by members of the Arts Alliance. How all these different specialists use 'empathetic processes' is the crux and deserves further exploration. The workshops will provide a context that promotes new connections/understandings about empathetic processes by practitioners currently working with diverse communities. In sharing existing insights from different practice-based styles of engagement, the network's workshops will build community capacity and help subject specialists and the communities they engage with better understand the issue of empathy. In particular, how creative strategies may be used in relationships to help deliver conflict management or to aid engagement with building empathy in groups who had previously not shown remorse, for example. Furthermore, sharing information about what have been called 'proxy processes' (traditionally understood as a process whereby some members of a decision-making body delegate their voting power to other members of the same body to vote in their absence) delivered by arts practitioners working within criminal justice system in the UK will occur. Such processes appear to play a significant role in creating empathic opportunities that help kick-start healing, and subsequent engagement with RJ by victims and offenders

Sharing good practice is needed because there are real obstacles to implementing RJ, including fear of offenders in being involved in the first place, resistance and suspicion by one or more of the parties involved (offenders, victims, practitioners, other community members with a vested interest) and a lack of the skills to offer empathetic tools or even access to proxy processes. Given that empathy and how to establish and apply it, is often the unspoken question of RJ, the workshops will address how to engage participants in empathetic processes. Design usefully engages with building empathy through role-playing, drawing on tools and techniques from theatre to engage users as partners in participatory design activity. Design and performance go beyond the creation of products and into the field of social innovation, including strategic processes of engagement with hard to reach groups or communities. Cardboard Citizens, Clean Break and the Geese Theatre Company are exemplar theatre organisations that teach empathetic processes to prisoners and have much tacit knowledge to share with other creatives. 

Different creative communities work using a variety of diverse interventions to reduce alienation, build empathy and/or catalyse effective community connections, but rarely do they have opportunities to share understandings which will be the central focus of this network. It is needed because what works to improve empathetic engagement will also contribute to improving social cohesion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will deliver new opportunities to build empathy in hard to reach groups, which will ultimately:

1. Substantially reduce some offender repeat offending;
2. Increase offences brought to justice (compared to Traditional Criminal Justice - TCJ)
3. Reduce crime victims' post-traumatic stress symptoms &amp;amp; related costs
4. Increase satisfaction (with justice) for both victims &amp;amp; offenders compared to TCJ
5. Reduce crime victims' desire for violent revenge against their offenders
6. Reduce the costs of criminal justice, when used as diversion from TCJ; &amp;amp;
7. Reduce recidivism more than prison (adults) does or as well as prison (youths) does. Adapted from Sherman and Strang (2007)

The impact of performance upon victims and perpetrators of crime is also significant. Theatre groups such as Cardboard Citizens, Clean Break, the Geese Theatre Company, Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, Shakespeare Behind Bars and the Performing Arts Learning and Teaching Innovation Network (PALATINE) have already shown that their work develops empathy in the roles and experiences of others by:

1. Building confidence and communication skills
2. Developing personal, social, artistic and professional skills such a trust and team work that impact on their lives and their engagement with wider society, including in some cases, the reduction of recidivism.

Similarly, there is significant evidence of design processes, methods and tools generating empathy for users. Using design probes, focus groups, observation and shadowing, video ethnography and immersive role-play, designers gain empathic understanding of the impact of their design actions upon users and others that come into contact with their design outputs.

Overall tools from performance and design may enhance RJ practitioner delivery. Also performance/design may better understand problems posed by RJ and respond. New ideas e.g. short drama courses aimed at RJ professionals or new design-led action research based interventions (linked to future partnerships and funding bids) could potentially develop. New methods and approaches may also contribute to the development of curricula/research methods amongst academic partners (particularly within design), development of engagement workshops amongst crime prevention partners, and development of new creative approaches amongst dramatic partners. In addition to uni-disciplinary impacts there will also be trans-disciplinary benefits linked to future collaboration within RJ, design and performance practices that are yet to be realised.

Finding new ways of deploying empathy - both engaging all classes of participants in RJ and in boosting the delivery of justice, crime reduction and community safety once the initial engagement has been secured - promises to realise and scale up the direct gains indicated by the systematic review of evaluative evidence quoted above. Beyond these gains, there are more speculative ones relating to how social cohesiveness can be supported by (and can support in its turn) a wider state of community safety and perception of fair and satisfying justice. Benefits and cost savings from processes of RJ are of interest to government, and in particular demand, to help mend 'Broken Britain'. 

Whilst the real impact of using creative strategies to further the aims and objectives of RJ may take some time to payback in demonstrable ways, we will apply ongoing impact evaluation throughout the project to understand/evidence impact in regards to levels of connectivity and outcomes of engagement within the network. Surveys of network members will provide qualitative evaluation too.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36192</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A Window Galleries exhibition at Central Saint Martins (14th January - 19th February 2016) titled 'London Graffiti and Street Art Dilemmas' invited audience feedback and empathetic engagement with the dilemmas graffiti brings to community audiences. 

The role of un-commissioned forms of creative practice in our cities and neighbourhoods is currently being reviewed. Increasingly, diverse populations appear to value street art and other ideas for colourful or playful cities. But where and when is the line drawn to decide that such art is no longer 'creative' or 'positive', but instead 'offensive' and 'detrimental' to a given community or environment? Do we leave such decisions wholly to the police, local councils or property management teams, or could the artists and communities affected, have not just a voice, but some collective control too? The purpose of the exhibition was to build empathy for different graffiti perspectives and find new ways to prototype ideas and promote dialogue. 

Lorraine Gamman and Marcus Willcocks of Design Against Crime Research Centre at Central Saint Martins collaborated with artist Steve Russell to create this experimental series of storyboards.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E9CACC2D-F46F-43EB-80EC-BFCE874150BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>tbc</gtr:impact><gtr:title>London Graffiti and Street Art Dilemmas exhibition</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://graffitidialogues.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hong Kong Design Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hong Kong Design Institute</gtr:description><gtr:id>E43C5EC6-797C-4BC2-8983-49A808AF8596</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gamman produced the reflective paper 'Open Mind: Shake Up Design by Taboo' which discussed her presentation at the Open Design Forum (Nov 2014) on empathy and taboo.

Barack Obama has famously written about an empathy &amp;quot;deficit&amp;quot; and the need for the human race to have more empathy for each other as well as the planet and similarly the economist Jeremy Rifkin has made the case for the need to build empathy. How do empathy &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; (including social games) expand or reinforce the human capacity for empathy, and what are the devices/strategies they utilize to make empathic connections and what is their value to participatory design research? Workshop participants discussed either an empathy `thing&amp;quot; to deconstruct or to attend as a critical friend who would engage in the deconstruction process.

Surprisingly, in the audience feedback forms, some of the participants requested that we offer practical designed engagement with 'empathic tools' or performance opportunities. Therefore, a fourth event, a Human Graffiti Library, was curated at Central Saint Martins on 15 December 2015 which involved event attendees (Readers) 'borrowing' people with different graffiti experiences and specialisms (Books) with the aim to initiate discussion and build empathy.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://extendingempathy.com/eventsarchive/events-archive</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Empathy and the Revolution of Human Relationships - talk by Roman Krznaric</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E1FECAD2-7C14-412C-AF8E-D664F41522A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Empathy and the Revolution of Human Relationships' - a public talk by cultural thinker and writer on the art of living and social change, Roman Krznaric was held on 28 Apr 2016, Central Saint Martins, Kings Cross, London to further promote UAL student engagement with the subject of empathy.

The outcome of this presentation was that Gamman co-created the 'Empathic Enterprise' brief which ran at UAL and MIT (from Feb - June 2016).

1. That there is real synergy between RJ, design and theatre/performance practitioners regarding the potential of techniques and processes developed for empathic encounters. We discovered &amp;quot;context is everything&amp;quot; when trying to build empathy and or designing empathic encounters also that those engaging with social innovation or working with communities need to better understand the role of emotion (affective as well as cognitive empathy) in terms of their own practice regarding community engagement strategies. Ultimately, all the Empathy workshops and events that took place discovered that building Empathy requires interaction, not just film, theatre or VR, experiences (which are also important as is reading literature), but that human interaction needs mutually democratic opportunities to share stories, and to facilitate the sort of participatory engagements that make it possible to build empathy. Either through designed processes that allow empathic encounters to happen or from other activities that enable Empathy between people to emerge or to be extended. 
 
2. To effectively communicate with diverse audiences and better share tools, techniques, case studies, definitions and ideas about what constitute &amp;quot;empathy&amp;quot; these methods must be experienced. Pragmatic and participatory empathic engagement strategies, as well as academic presentations, are needed to maximize impact. Overall our Network events attracted circa 1000 participants and whilst the first three workshop of academic presentations by key experts in the field (from Participatory Design, Performance/Theatre and Restorative Justice from 4 international 3 European countries as well as UK ) received good feedback. And also led to further engagement by groups such as the DESIS network (who particularly related empathy issues to migration); and the Empathy Museum, and The Positive Deviance Network, nevertheless some audience members requested more participatory engagement opportunities .Two further funded participatory empathic engagement Network events were held including &amp;quot;A Human Graffiti Library&amp;quot; experience and a DRS &amp;quot;Empathy Things&amp;quot; catalysation seminar - both received positive feedback.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Filming seminars and locating them on (http://extendingempathy.com/eventsarchive) has also enabled further international engagement, the &amp;quot;Culture of Empathy Network&amp;quot; have further disseminated the empathy talks and encourage Network participants to engage with their forums (including their Empathy Training Group and Empathy Design Group.) We anticipate further use of these resources in the future. 
 
The PI of the Network was invited to curate (after the Network funding expired) an &amp;quot;Open Design for Empathy &amp;quot;stream in Hong Kong which took place in November 2016 attracting over 20 paper submissions. She was also invited and became a member of the Empathy Museum board. Both activities have created opportunities for the research findings to be applied further afield and in diverse contexts as well as opening up future collaborative potential. Colleague Adam Thorpe and Network design participating are discussing with PI Gamman curating further design led Empathy events and are exploring putting together a book of essays from key participants about &amp;quot;Empathy Things - about designing FOR empathy&amp;quot;, and contemplating further funding opportunities with Network partners, although Brexit has rather dashed some plans.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C93FFCED-8B1A-4A08-A8B3-E0E64D2FC2C8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://extendingempathy.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F45851B2-2222-4E47-977B-72829D952DB1"><gtr:id>F45851B2-2222-4E47-977B-72829D952DB1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Offenders No More: New Offender Rehabilitation Theory and Practice</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1b6bef78f8348c211b0da99bcd6017d3"><gtr:id>1b6bef78f8348c211b0da99bcd6017d3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gamman L and Thorpe A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-63483-681-4</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/80B62B94-33D1-4812-8C10-330F4F402DD1"><gtr:id>80B62B94-33D1-4812-8C10-330F4F402DD1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Open Mind: Shake Up Design by Taboo</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f4f3443934cfe7f84115e492053dde9d"><gtr:id>f4f3443934cfe7f84115e492053dde9d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gamman L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L01355X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB55E3F-FFEA-4BE8-9850-37FB373F4D31</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4DC83A15-ACD4-4667-BA6F-2DB8EFCF166F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theories Of Theatre</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
