&lt;p>The core idea of this project is that though the agent's behaviour is partly governed by &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; preferences (expressing the agent's welfare); the agent may make errors. Errors can be conceptualised as the failure on the part of the agent to apply preference maximisation (ie to be rational) over the entire set of physically available alternatives (and hence to act in a globally optimal way). In other words, the agent may fail to consider some courses of action physically available to him: for example, they may not be salient, or be excluded from assessment on psychological, ideological, moral or social grounds (before their &amp;quot;utility&amp;quot; is even considered).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will show that this framework subsumes a large number of existing models of bounded rationality, and proposes to develop a formal probabilistic general model that captures this idea. Further, a number of more specific and policy relevant models will be analysed, in particular to answer questions regarding the so called &amp;quot;dependency culture&amp;quot; and the design and welfare evaluation of schemes inspired by the nudge approach.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect our research to be of interest to both other scholars in academia as well as policy-makers. We discuss the impact for academic beneficiaries in the relevant section of this application. As for policy-makers, obviously using the wrong model as a framework for analysis and policy guidance can lead to consequences that are very different from the ones originally envisaged. Boundedly rational behaviour can lead economic actors to respond to incentives differently from standard utility maximising agents, and either neutralise the desired policy outcomes, or lead to unwanted consequences. For this reasons we believe our results will be useful for policy-makers. The ideal end user of our research in this respect is an economist working for the Government Economic Service (GES), and our objective in this respect is to inform such operators of the new developments and provide the tools to bring a new perspective to real policy making. Possible positive consequences would be to increase the effectiveness of public services and policy. Indeed, the British government is reactive to relevant input from academic research: the establishment of the Behavioural Insight Unit of the Cabinet Office by the current government shows that there is an appreciation of behavioural issues in policy circles. We would hope that the insights from our research will in time find their way in government reports and policy documents. 

We will be seeking to circulate our outputs among the economists working in the GES exploiting the PI's link with them as a previous Academic Assessors for the GES Economic boards (part of the GES hiring process). Professionals in the GES are an important target audience in terms of the non academic impact of the proposed research, since they advise ministers and senior officials and help shape the details of various economic policies. In addition, we will seek to establish links with the Behavioural Insight Team of the Cabinet Office. In tailoring our approach to these end users we will be seeking the advice of one of our colleagues, Prof. David Ulph, who used to work as an economist for that Government department.

The way we think the results of our research may benefit policy makers is by informing policy on the different ways boundedly rational agents may respond to incentives, which, as we highlighted in the case for support, may be very different from the standard rational agent paradigm. Indeed, we expect to be able to formulate policy implications of the models developed in the second and third strands of our research directly into the resulting research papers. As for engagement with potential users outside the economic profession (e.g. in the legal, consumer research and marketing profession), both PI and co-PI have some experience in disseminating technical material to audiences of interested audiences with no or little economic background (e.g. the non technical survey &amp;quot;Arbitration and Mediation: an Economic Perspective&amp;quot;, by Paola Manzini and Marco Mariotti, written for the legal publication European Business Organization Law Review), and we plan to write at least one non-technical and accessible paper to explain the main open problems and summarise our main findings.

Of course, all materials generated in the course of the grant (including both academic and non academic working papers) will be publicly available via a dedicated website.

The nature of the project is such that we do not envisage the commercial exploitation of our results.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>404604</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talks to Max Plank Institute, Berlin</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54CD7692-4014-4619-8C62-1E7BF2A4DAD4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visit and two seminars to the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (part of Max Plank Institute for Human Cognition) in May 2015 for dissemination of the result - this is an interdisciplinary centre directed by an eminent psychologist, Professor Gerd Gigerenzer, who has a life long interest in bounded rationality.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk to Department of Work and Pensions</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2FC999AB-7488-4465-89A7-DFFDA7ADA74F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar given to the Department of Work and Pensions, Caxton House, London, Thursday, 31 May, 2-3pm in May 2012 (invited by them following a previous contact with members of the Behaviour Insight Team, at the time part of the Cabinet Office). The team of our contact was writing a position paper on whether the DWP should develop its capability for behavioural modelling. The behavioural models they were aware of assume that individuals act rationally and so these models appear less suited to model, e.g. benefit take-up rates, since an rational individual in these models would always take up any benefit they are entitled to.
Marco Mariotti and I presented our results, however after our interaction it emerged that they needed something more immediately applicable to estimation of econometrics models, which of course could not be available at that time: this activity was carried out after knowing the grant had been awarded, but before its start, as the opportunity arose.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at the Network for integrated Behavioral Sciences Workshop, University of East Anglia, 4-6 April 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>467E6ACB-55CB-4D42-AE22-77279E9406F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Both Manzini and Mariotti were invited as plenary speakers to the event above.

In spite of its recent publication, this output has so far produced impact in education, having been included in the syllabi of taught modules in various universities in the US (including Ivy League ones, specifically Brown and Columbia) and Continental Europe, both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, including for example:

It is far too early to ascertain whether undergraduate students have made any use of the results of our research, but as far as postgraduate students go, we find evidence that presence in education courses has resulted in some Graduate students (as opposed to established Scholars), both at PGT and PGR level from prestigious international universities centering their dissertation around modification of our work. This will hopefully extend and expand the educational impact to future generations of economists.

Psychologists and marketing scientists emphasise that this is unrealistic, as cognitive bounds often make agents miss some of the available options: e.g. investors ignore foreign shares and patients only assess a handful of hospitals. 

The first contribution of the research funded by this project has been to combine the psychological insight with rigorous economic techniques to build a more realistic model of choice behavior. In particular, our premise is that agent's cognitive abilities are limited, and so is their attention. Consequently, though they may be able to express a clear preference between any two alternatives, they may fail to spot the best ones (e.g. because of limited attention), ending up with suboptimal outcomes.

We have succeeded in formalising these ideas in such a way that we can:
- Test, at least in principle, whether observed choice behavior fits the (unobserved) choice procedure that we postulate decision makers to follow, and
- Provided the above test is passed, we are able to retrieve uniquely both the unobserved preference and the cognitive (attention) components that drive decisions.
 
These results are discussed in the output &amp;quot;Stochastic Choice and Consideration Sets&amp;quot;, published in Econometrica.

A second important contribution of this research has been to provide pointers for scholars in other areas of economic investigation. More precisely, the &amp;quot;limited attention tests&amp;quot; referred to above rely on the availability of a very rich set of observations, which is seldom available to a researcher. Yet, since our model above postulates that the source of errors (i.e. randomness) in choice stems from attention failure and not from preference variability, it suggests new avenues for empirical scholars to follow in defining the estimation strategies in various applied problems. While most of the existing empirical literature focusses on strategies to estimate demand parameters when agents may fail to consider all of the available alternatives, our framework provides a theoretical setup that can be adapted to underpin these models and provide them with microfoundations, either reinforcing existing results, or pointing to alternative empirical strategies.

The third contribution of our research has been to look at the welfare implications for policy decisions when agents may be boundedly rational. In such circumstances observed behaviours generally cannot be described by the standard economic approach, as they are often self-conflicting, e.g. indicating different priorities for Council Tax spending depending on which other, unchosen options are presented in a survey.

How is a policy maker to pick a policy to implement if he observes such inconsistent choices? In the paper &amp;quot;Welfare economics and bounded rationality: The case for model-based approaches&amp;quot;, published in the Journal of Economic Methodology we contrast a model- less and a model-based approach to welfare economics. We expand at length on the reasons why a model is a better instrument for a policy maker, but in a nutshell we can summarise them as: a model clarifies the reasons for inconsistent choices, thereby furnishing the policymaker with additional information.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In economics we see two potential academic routes for our results to be used by others within economics. One is via increased research capability through training (in this respect, we take the fact that our &amp;quot;Stochastic choice and consideration sets&amp;quot; output already features in the syllabus of a graduate course at Brown University as an encouraging sign); the other is through the use of it that we hope our more applied colleagues will make in the estimation. In this respect, we ourselves are in the process of establishing research links with empirical colleagues to help drive this research avenue forward to consider specific applications.

With reference to non academic uses, this is more indirect as we need the empirical results first to drive suggestions for policy adjustments. However we believe that Healthcare and Retail may be relevant sectors where this research can be taken forward by others, due to the work on &amp;quot;consideration sets&amp;quot; being pursued in those area (in particular hospital choice and automobile markets).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1791C0AF-A381-4D8B-B469-7067815AAFE9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7570BD30-BA88-4A45-BBB1-B47957525671"><gtr:id>7570BD30-BA88-4A45-BBB1-B47957525671</gtr:id><gtr:title>Welfare economics and bounded rationality: the case for model-based approaches</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Economic Methodology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3e1ee9b7542088f79f6c848a2f350bde"><gtr:id>3e1ee9b7542088f79f6c848a2f350bde</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Manzini P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4A668494-64FB-4484-B9EC-F8B3ACE3BE47"><gtr:id>4A668494-64FB-4484-B9EC-F8B3ACE3BE47</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inferring Cognitive Heterogeneity from Aggregate Choices</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bff0308e66f61b00449c008e8b7dd384"><gtr:id>bff0308e66f61b00449c008e8b7dd384</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dardanoni V, Manzini P, Mariotti M, Tyson CJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/02972A0E-F3ED-47BB-AB59-33398AE50517"><gtr:id>02972A0E-F3ED-47BB-AB59-33398AE50517</gtr:id><gtr:title>Imperfect Attention and Menu Evaluation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fa1368fe7657f4360316d5a5748c2ceb"><gtr:id>fa1368fe7657f4360316d5a5748c2ceb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Manzini P and Mariotti M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J012513/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
