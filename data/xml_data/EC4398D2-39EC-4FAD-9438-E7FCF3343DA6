Music publishing is an old established industry that has adapted to successive technological and institutional changes, especially copyright law, by adopting different strategies and business models. While producing essentially the same product - namely services for access to composed music - it moved from one form of exploitation to another: from selling sheet music to securing performances, to licensing sound recordings, to syndication through radio and TV broadcasting, to advertising licensing, and to the assembly and exploitation of back catalogue. How it has survived and what historical and economic factors can explain those adaptations make for an exemplary case study to understand the future of creative industries in the digital age.
The research focuses on the economic history of the publishing industry over a period of time of two centuries. Its objective is to understand the process of adaptation to many-sided changes (technological, institutional and economic). The purpose is to shed light on how to react to the opportunities and threats posed by digitisation and what combination of market-based strategies and public policies seems appropriate to achieve sustained growth.
Our research method consists of selecting a number of long lasting works/titles and tracing their product cycle according to certain key variables. The sample includes a large number of works that have been exploited over a long period of time in different technological and institutional contexts and across different jurisdictions. The research traces the product cycle of each musical work by using a series of parameters, such as form of publication, changes of ownership, marketing strategies, performance history, business model, and so on. It then tries to explain the changes in the forms of exploitation by applying a multivariate analysis which takes into account a series of factors, like costs and revenues, impact of technological change, complementarity and substitutability between product forms (eg. live performance vs. sound recording), and the impact of legislative change (eg. extension of copyright terms). The research aims at responding to a straightforward question: What factors explain the economic survival of the music publishing industry across technological, economic and institutional changes?
The project addresses this question by adopting an inter-disciplinary approach which combines cultural economics and copyright law specialists with particular expertise in the historical development of the music industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The major academic impact of the project will be to open a series of new perspectives on the economic history of copyright. The shift to study the music publishing industry's survival strategies will show how significantly important for the development of creative industries has been the adaptation to new challenges and different ways to exploit music. In other words, the project will re-frame - broaden and deepen - the current intellectual property debate.
The project is also expected to have a significant impact beyond the academic community. Music industry is a crucial element of today's UK cultural industry, and of UK economy in general. To understand the long-run dynamics and 'survival strategies' adopted across two centuries will indirectly help identify pathways beyond the current 'digital crisis' of the UK music industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146472</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Video animation and text for CopyrightUser.org, the online resource aimed at making UK copyright law accessible to creators, media professionals, entrepreneurs, students, and members of the public.

- the economics of publishing in a given period or sector, and its effects on the circulation of knowledge;

- the political, cultural, or philosophical underpinnings of public access to knowledge;

- the strategies developed by authors or publishers to protect their intellectual property;

- the perceived boundaries between legitimate and piratical publications;

- the consequences of specific laws or institutional arrangements for the circulation of knowledge in different domains;

- the use of historical examples in arguments about copyright and the public domain;

Our research added to this in two ways: by analysing the switch in business models from sales to rights management from an economic point of view and by exploring the legal aspects of the change to collectivisation of royalty collection. These changes were triggered by the advent of mass media - sound recording, radio etc - to which copyright law responded with the 1911 Copyright Act - and music publishers began to collect royalties from mechanical and performing rights. In terms of business models, a major change was in the adoption of royalty contracts, replacing the previous buy-out of copyright deals that had been the norm, particularly for song-writers, from the beginnings of music publishing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Working Paper on Product Cycles in Music Publishing is intended as a resource (and a warning) for future researchers. More broadly, however, the underlying motive for the research is that historical experience of changes in technologies and copyright has resonance for our own times. We analysed the period in music publishing, namely, the turn of the 20th century, during which fundamental (exogenous) technological changes took place that profoundly affected the industry but which were beyond their control. There is a clear parallel with the impact of digitisation on other creative industries taking place now. Our research clearly showed that changes to business models were fundamental in the survival of music publishing as an industry. Those changes were in the changes to contracts with creators on the one hand and in collectivization of rights management on the other. As remuneration rights are a current topic in copyright for the creative industries, our research provides a solid basis for discussing them.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C718586D-02CA-4F3E-A896-851F569903DA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://microsites.bournemouth.ac.uk/cippm/2014/06/13/evolution-of-the-music-publishing-industry/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Copyrightuser.org</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4176CE33-E125-4CBB-A939-D73793C79480</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participation of Ruth Towse and Maurizio Borghi in the advisory committee of the educational tool &amp;quot;Copyright user&amp;quot; has made copyright more accessible to users.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://copyrightuser.org</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>IP Kat</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CD5BF429-D767-42FB-B244-D79B1DB6F389</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/cmon-cmon-music-publishing.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>List of song titles, publishers and prices made available in digital form by the Music Collections at the British Library.
