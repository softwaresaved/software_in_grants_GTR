The city of Bath hides a little known gem of history named Fairfield House, where an Ethiopian Emperor - who was said to descend from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba - lived with his royal family, government advisers and Ethiopian Orthodox priests, in quiet exile from 1936 - 1941. At Fairfield the Emperor had an onsite greenhouse converted into an Ethiopian Orthodox church. When the Emperor returned to Ethiopia, he gave the house to the city as a gift to be used by its elder citizens. Sounding like a story from fairy-tales, this research network project will use the basis of this very real moment in Bath's history, and explore related topics from the perspective of how it translates to the lives of today's Black and White residents living in a similar, but also changed, Bath landscape, (a landscape that the Emperor said reminded him of his Ethiopian home). To achieve this intercultural and multilayered dialogue, the project will employ a diverse range of innovative creative methods and approaches to engage audiences in debate and new forms of thinking. These approaches, such as; theatre, photography, pop-up museums, and 'safe spaces' to bring seemingly opposing groups together to find common ground, will be innovative in generating new knowledge from under-researched groups, (most specifically Ethiopian and Rastafari communities), and also by revisiting familiar ideas from new critical perspectives.

The project has invited five guest curators to bring to a public audience themes, voices and debates seldom heard in open arenas, and engage history in a seamless way to discuss issues of the day, and creating new understandings in the process. The curators will present a range of themed seasons, followed by a published book which captures the whole experience for further study.

The seasons of this project will engage in debates relating to;

- Reluctant Sites Of Memory 
- Collective Security
- Rastafari and Ethiopian Politics
- Documenting Presence
- Liberated Spaces

'Ethiopian Echoes on the British Landscape' will be a unique experience for the city of Bath to not only imagine a new narrative, (different from stories of the Romans, Georgians, and Jane Austen), but to embrace a true story many of its residents didn't realise it already possesses.

The University of the West of England will work with Fairfield House as its key partner, which for the past 20 years has been resident home of the Bath Ethnic Minority Senior Citizens Association (BEMSCA), who will also be a central collaborating organisation.

Using multidisciplinary creative arts and social science approaches, the project will explore this central question:

- 'What can Anglo-Ethiopian relations, in context of the Fairfield House story, tell us about post-colonial discourses and diversity debates concerning the African diaspora in contemporary British society?'

By addressing this central key question across these five seasons of activity, this project will create a number of new dynamic networks that will facilitate the exploration of previously under-researched ideas and connections that will generate new knowledge in the fields of heritage studies, history, and post-colonial discourses, and the role of the creative arts in stimulating dialogue and creating shared value. This project will work with groups and facilitators both external to and within academia, and will create innovative bridges across formal and informal learning spaces. This project will also help position Fairfield House and the city of Bath as a site of intercultural dialogue, and play a significant role in bringing to the surface largely undocumented voices on highly topical and pertinent issues relating to the important debates regarding the dynamics of the African diaspora in contemporary Britain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>SENIOR CITIZENS who use Fairfield House for their day care, and members of the wider Bath community in their older years. Older people will be engaged in a rich range of interactive activities, events and conversations that will stimulate them in ways that will both exercise their cognitive and creative abilities, (in accordance with the theme of 'Priority 8 -Improved services for older people' in the Bath &amp;amp; North East Somerset Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2015-2019, page 26). These activities will draw on their expertise and skills to contribute towards new knowledge, positioning them as valued members of society, which in itself also contributes towards a sense of wellbeing and belonging.

ETHIOPIAN COMMUNITY - members of both the secular Ethiopian community, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, view Fairfield as an important site of significance and pilgrimage. This project will provide the opportunity for history to be shared and 'new' histories unearthed, and for their community to come together and explore new ideas regarding their history and presence between themselves and in dialogue with others. 

RASTAFARI COMMUNITY - The views and practices of the Rastafari community are significantly under-researched, and where they are, largely misrepresented. This project will enable Rastafari members to explore and document their views on their own terms, facilitated by members of their own community. This project will also go some way to redressing the balance of common misunderstandings about the Rastafari way of life, and help position their influential role in various pan-Africanist campaigns, and also the significant Rastafari presence working in voluntary sector organisations in the UK, which has largely been unrecognised and undocumented. A further direct aim of the impact of those participating from the Rastafari community will be to help establish in Fairfield an archive and database of related research, to be a resource usable by other scholars. This is an initiative that Rastafari members of the committee have wanted to implement for some time, though needed additional support and guidance to make that happen. This project will work with that group to begin this process.

LOCAL RESIDENTS - As all of the events of this project are free, and most open to the general public, general Bathonians, tourists and others who attend sessions will gain direct impact from learning new angles to history they were previously unaware of. This project will also work with local schools, working with the children on aspects of Ethiopian culture and Rastafari religious beliefs. The project will bring together different groups and individuals, creating new dialogues and understanding. This aspect will also directly impact Fairfield, who want to be seen as an accessible space to all, and need mechanisms to reach audiences that would not otherwise be inclined to visit. Likewise the city of Bath in general will benefit, as the tourist trade will have a new offer for visitors of regular events at Fairfield, and new market opportunities opening up.

NATIONAL and INTERNATIONAL - Fairfield already attracts visitors from across the UK at least once a month, when the house is used by the Rastafari community for 'Sabbath' days. This project will engage with existing visitors to Fairfield at a much deeper level than before, and provide two-way dialogues of understanding of greater depth insights for both research facilitators and participants. The house is also visited by people who have heard about it and are generally curious, who have relevant stories of their own to tell. Often there is no suitable mechanism to record these stories, and this project will work with Fairfield staff towards a suitable methodology to document these occurrences, having a direct impact on the site's knowledge base, working towards a Fairfield House archive.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24186</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P007031/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF8321C4-0BDE-4E78-8A6D-3F3FA99A9138</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
