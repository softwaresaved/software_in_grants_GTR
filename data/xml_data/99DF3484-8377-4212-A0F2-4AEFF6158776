Paediatric cataract presents the major preventable cause of visual impairment and blindness in childhood. 
The only treatment for Paediatric cataract is surgery. Unfortunately, cataract surgery in children results in the postsurgical complication of Paediatric Posterior Capsular Opacification (PPCO) which is virtually inevitable, occurring in almost 100% of cases. PPCO is characterized by the rapid formation of Visual Axis Opacification (VAO) which is seen as cloudy areas on the posterior lens capsule. This leads to rapid secondary vision damage. Several additional surgical procedures have been devised to either minimize or eliminate VAO, including removal of the posterior capsule and anterior vitreous body in order to remove cell growth substrates and thus cell proliferations. Unfortunately, even these procedures seldom facilitate a permanently clear visual axis and the incidence of PPCO remains at 80-100%. 
PPCO is caused by the aggressive proliferation and migration of lens epithelial cells (LECs) left in the capsule bag after surgery. Theoretically, since these residual cells are responsible for the opacification, their removal at the time of surgery should reduce or remove the risk of proliferation of cells and PPCO. 
At present, the only effective treatment of PCO is Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, which involves clearing the visual axis by creating a central opening in the opacified posterior capsule. Although this procedure is easy and quick, there are complications, including retinal detachment, damage to the intraocular lens (IOL), cystoid macular edema and more. Unlike adults, children are too young to cooperate with this procedure. 
Research laboratories worldwide attempting to eliminate the problem are focusing on several strategies, including improving surgical techniques, IOL materials and IOL designs, use of therapeutic agents, and combination therapy. Recent improvements in surgical techniques and IOL materials and designs have served mainly to DELAY THE ONSET of PCO rather than ELIMINATE the problem. The use of cytotoxic agents carries the risk of toxic effects on surrounding ocular tissues. there is therefore an urgent need to develop a routine clinical procedure to stop the problem. 
We have developed a potential treatment to SELECTIVELY remove these LECs during cataract surgery by exposing LECS to an osmotic shock whilst blocking their ability to protect themselves from this shock. This procedure leads to shrinkage and detachment of these cells, allowing them to be rinsed away from the lens bag during surgery. We are fortunate that our treatment can selectively target unwanted LECs, thereby not DAMAGING surrounding eye tissues. The results so far have been extremely promising, however, prior to clinical trials we need to test the proposed therapy in a full in vivo trial and optimise some key parameters that cannot be performed in in vitro studies. 
If successful, this research will provide significant benefits to both children and adult cataract patients, consequently offering enormous clinical and economic advantages. The research will also simplify current paediatric cataract operating procedures and prevent the serious complications that can be caused by extra surgical procedures. The ultimate goal of cataract surgery, besides the restoration of distance visual acuity, is the restoration of accommodation. A few new accommodating IOLs have the potential of restoring accommodation following cataract surgery. However, two main difficulties have hampered the success of these IOL strategies. PCO is one of them and this work will therefore facilitate further development of these new technologies which are currently rendered not feasiab</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Paediatric Posterior Cataract Opacification (PPCO) remains the most common complication of pediatric cataract surgery and occurs in almost every operation. It is caused by rapid and aggressive proliferation and migration of residual Lens Epithelial Cells (LECs) left in the capsule bag after cataract surgery. 
 Theoretically, since these residual cells are responsible for the opacification, their removal at the time of surgery should reduce or remove the risk of aggressive proliferation of cells and PPCO. A simple cell removal procedure has been developed by use of hyperosmolar irrigation solutions that cause cell shrinkage and detachment from the lens capsule bag. However, this procedure must overcome cellular Regulatory Volume Increase (RVI) defense mechanisms that protect against shrinkage. 
We have previously shown that the RVI mechanism in LECs can be selectively disabled by using a combination of hyperosmolar shock and inhibitors of the Na/K/2Cl cotransporters. Thus selective shrinkage and detachment would completely remove LECs as a potential treatment for the prevention of PPCO. 
 Preliminary results have been extremely promising and we are therefore ready to move to the next stage of full animal trials to assess long-term in vivo efficacy and chronic adverse effects (if any) of the treatment protocol, and to optimize some key parameters to a level suitable for clinical implementation. More specifically we need:
 1. To conduct a full rabbit trial to assess long-term in vivo efficacy and chronic adverse effects (if any) of the therapy.
 2. To refine the treatment procedure to a level suitable for clinical trials, for example, to shorten the treatment duration, develop a suitable application technique to introduce the therapeutic solution into capsular bag and to confirm the impact of a cell-free-capsule on its elasticity and clarity.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We believe that the proposed treatment offers enormous economic and social benefits: 

1. Blindness has profound human and economic consequences in all societies due to loss of independence, self-esteem and economic productivity among those affected and their families[1-6]. There are also additional costs involved in providing special needs education for children and rehabilitation services for those with irreversible loss of vision[7]. 
 Loss of vision in children influences their education, employment and social life. More significantly, children who are blind have to overcome a lifetime of emotional, social and economic difficulties which affect the child, the family and society [8]. Childhood blindness is second only to adult cataract as a cause of blind-person years. Approximately 70 million blind-person years are caused by childhood blindness of which about 10 million blind-person years (14%) is due to childhood cataract. Timely recognition and intervention can eliminate blind-years due to childhood cataract, as the condition is treatable [4]. 
 Childhood blindness is estimated to lead to a loss in earning capacity of US$6,000-27,000 million [9]. By extrapolation, assuming a global growth rate of 3%, the economic loss over 10 years for childhood cataract would be in the order of US$1,000-6,000 million. Estimates in India [10], assuming a blind child has on average 33 years of blindness, and that 14% of childhood blindness is due to cataracts, calculate a lifetime loss of earning capacity of US$3,500 million to childhood cataract. The cost of a cataract intervention in India is of the order of US$100-200, depending on facilities. The cost of treating the 40,000 blind children from cataract in India would be US$4-8 million. 
 The only treatment for cataract is cataract surgery. Unfortunately, cataract surgery in children results in the postsurgical complication of PPCO, which is virtually inevitable, at an unacceptably high level of 80-100% [11-14]. Furthermore, for adults, the World Health Report estimates that there are at least 110 million eyes with cataract causing severe visual impairment and this number is steadily increasing due to population growth and increasing life expectancy. PCO rates for adult eyes of 11.8% after 1 year and 28.4% after 5 years were reported [15-17]. 
 The clinical and economic significance of both paediatric and adult cataract and its surgical complication of PCO is therefore an important public health problem; there is therefore an urgent need to develop a suitable therapy. This work provides a potential therapy for this public problem and will potentially bring benefits to both child and adult cataract patients worldwide. 

2. Impact on surgeons and physicians involved in cataract surgery for both children and adults. The research will simplify current paediatric cataract operating procedures and prevent the serious complications that can be caused by extra surgical procedures.
