Impact on Health: A Longitudinal Analysis</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N011791/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Survey research of ethnic minorities in the 1960s brought the reality of ethnic and racial discrimination to the forefront of the national debate, playing a key role in anti-discrimination legislation in 1968. Despite legislation, ethnic and racial discrimination and harassment continues to be a feature of British Society, although this has declined against some groups and intensified against others. Not only does this violate the principle of a fair and equal society, it also has palpable adverse impacts on health, particularly mental health. The last comprehensive evidence of harassment was collected in 1994 and since then there is little statistical evidence about the prevalence of harassment and its impact on the health of ethnic minorities in Britain. 

This research uses a new, large-scale data source, Understanding Society, on minorities in Britain to investigate the current prevalence and type of ethnic harassment and its relationship to mental health and health behaviours such as smoking, drinking and physical activity. Since 2009, Understanding Society has been interviewing around 51,000 adults, including 10,000 ethnic minorities. The large sample size of the Understanding Society database allows us to look at who experiences harassment, where harassment is most likely, and what kind of harassment is most common. For instance, we will investigate how gender, age and education level intersect to produce particular vulnerabilities to both verbal and physical abuse as well as avoidance or feeling unsafe. We will determine in which locations people are more likely to experience harassment: in the street, on public transport, at the workplace? How might these differ in areas of low or high ethnic concentration? Because Understanding Society asks the same individuals about harassment repeatedly over time, we can examine not only one off experiences but also find to what extent people report persistent harassment. 

After establishing new benchmark estimates of harassment in the UK, we will go on to test for the impact of harassment on mental health and health behaviours. It is well known that those who experience harassment are more likely to have poor mental health, and that those stressed by harassment may turn to unhealthy coping behaviours such as drinking or tobacco use. However, it is difficult to establish causality, because individuals who experience harassment may also have personality traits or underlying proclivities which also lead them to have poor mental health or worse health behaviours. Fortunately, Understanding Society will enable us to establish time-order reasoning and to use statistical techniques which allow us to better establish causality in these relationships. Moreover, we can also investigate to which extent family relationships, friendships, presence of others of the same ethnic group in the neighbourhood and sense of belonging and identity protects minorities experiencing harassment from worsening mental health and health behaviours. Having repeated observations across time also enables us to examine whether any negative effects of harassment dissipate over time or if repeated experiences are more stressful than one off incidences. 

This research will have direct relevance to those who work with minority communities such as local governments and local services, as well as policy makers concerned with health and health equality. To make best use of the research we will meet frequently with a policy-orientated advisory group who will help refine our research questions and disseminate our findings to those governmental and third party organisations that will benefit from it, and develop a platform for research co-production to support a better, shared understanding.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will directly benefit all government departments concerned with racism, but in particular the current lead agencies, namely the Government Equalities Office, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Department of Communities &amp;amp; Local Government. We will provide the first representative estimates of the prevalence of different forms of ethnic and racial harassment, which can be used to benchmark progress in anti-discrimination and inclusion policies in the past 25 years. Establishing different probabilities of harassment across individuals of different characteristics and residing in different areas will enable targeted interventions towards those most vulnerable to harassment. Local level information will be of particular interest to the DCLG. 

The research will also directly benefit policy makers and third sector organisations concerned with health and ethnic inequalities and reducing and eliminating harassment and discrimination. More closely establishing the causal effects of harassment will inform health policy targeted towards minority communities of their particular challenges. Exploring variation in the effect of harassment on mental health, for instance through moderating effects such as age, sex, or social network composition, this research will identify potential sources of resilience to harassment. Disseminating new information on such sources of resilience will help inform policy makers of interventions that can protect those most vulnerable. These findings will also enable third party organisations serving minority communities, such as the Race Equality Forum, the Equality and Diversity Forum, the Migrant and Refugee Communities Forum, and the Quest for Economic Development (QED), to better target clients most in need. To ensure that our research reaches these targets, we have commitments from all of the third party organisations mentioned above (see also Pathways to Impact) to serve on our dedicated Advisory Group. The AG will be involved in co-production by participating in every stage of the project, its efforts culminating in the organisation of an open general dissemination workshop as well as a more targeted &amp;quot;closed conversation&amp;quot; event to distil the most important policy messages.

We anticipate that our research will achieve impact by informing the general public. Racial and ethnic harassment, discrimination and inequality are core topics in British political debates. It is thus important for the British public to be aware of current challenges facing minority members, and be well informed by quality estimates of the prevalence of the problem and its impact on health. 

In general, the findings of this project will contribute to the discussion surrounding the need for and implementation of anti-discriminatory and protective policies. 

Finally, gaining significant academic impact (described later in the proposal) will also be central to the anticipated public policy impact as government efforts towards bearing down on racial discrimination over several decades have been impeded by a lack of robust evidence on its prevalence and its patterns of impact, and on identifying risk groups and harassment &amp;quot;hot spots&amp;quot;. This knowledge is central to informing policy debate on priorities and accountabilities for intervention.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>138059</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Roundtable meeting of the EU Commission funded project: Growth, Equal Opportunities, Migration and Markets (GEMM)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>804661B2-3877-4895-AEA9-A34F8029D0D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussed research findings from the GEMM project on labour market inequality and ethnic discrimination in relationship to our research on ethnic inequality in mental health and harassment</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stand Up To Racism - Colchester</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EB1A8EA4-0575-46CA-92BE-1A65A54B8C87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alita Nandi and Renee Luthra presented research on ethnic and racial harassment at a rally for Stand Up To Racism - Colchester.

We also presented our initial results to students at the University of Essex in classroom activities. The students were very receptive to the findings, being able to relate to experiences of harassment in their own lives. The study also illustrated the importance of survey research in addition to police report data, an important part of being a critical consumer of information.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>489FB135-3DF9-435C-A584-6A36122A01BB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. During the period 2009-14, around one in ten ethnic minorities reported experiencing ethnic and racial harassment. This was higher for Chinese men and women, Pakistani men, Indian-Sikh men, Indian-Muslim men and Bangladeshi women and lower for women in most of the ethnic groups.
2. In most ethnic groups, twice as many people anticipated or feared harassment than actually experienced it. Women weremore likely than men to anticipate or fear harassment and less likely to report experiencing it.
3. The likelihood of experiencing ethnic and racial harassment is lower for those living with a higher proportion of their own ethnic group members after taking into account area level deprivation.
4. Those who experienced ethnic and racial harassment also reported worse mental health. This was also the case for those who did not experience it but anticipated or feared it. We also found that the mental health cost of harassment was lower higher number of friends. 
As we used data from a nationally representative large scale survey data and applied appropriate statistical methods, these results are applicable to the wider society.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are planning a What Works type event in May bringing together researchers (including us) working in the areas of harassment, prejudice and the health costs of harassment and key impact participants who work in these fields.
