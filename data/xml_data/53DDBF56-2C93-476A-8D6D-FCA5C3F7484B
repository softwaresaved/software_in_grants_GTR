During this period, Berliners were under significant pressure to define and cope with various challenges themselves, as gender relations, stable careers and social conventions all came under severe pressure. They faced the prospect of economic failure, isolation or personal crisis. Yet they were also offered blueprints recommending them to adjust flexibly to changing circumstances as well as to remain true to one's own self. In turn, the contemporary media as well as approaches and complaints by ordinary people reflect a popular quest for individual mobility, attention and care. This constituted an important claim towards public institutions and political leadership, which were increasingly expected to protect and support Berliners as individuals.\n\nA crucial argument of this book will be that all four political regimes in the period reacted to this individualised expectation and professed to fulfill it. This includes the 'Third Reich' as well as the German Democratic Republic, in spite of the commonplace but misleading labeling of both Nazi and Communist ideologies and systems as 'collectivistic'. The extent to which democracies and dictatorships were successful in fulfilling individualised expectations, or in suggesting that they fulfilled them, was the yardstick on which their popular support rested. In that sense, the history of individuality can shed light on the interpretation of Weimar Germany and its 'crisis', the reordering of society and culture in the 'Third Reich' and the conflict between 'West' and 'East' in the emerging Cold War. The book will thus be a major contribution to the historiography of twentieth-century Germany as well as a pioneer in the history of individuality in contemporary Europe, which would appeal to historically interested practitioners of sociology, German studies, urban studies, and cultural studies more generally. \n\nThe project is based on a careful analysis of the meanings ascribed to 'individuality' in the media as well as in the utterances and activities of Berliners from different walks of life. It thus combines an analysis of published discourse with a history of conflicts 'on the ground'. The research is underpinned by a theoretical understanding of 'individuality' as a complex field of utterances and activities around the status of the person rather than a single and stable notion. Sources include political speeches, newspaper articles on urban life and publications of diverse associations; documents of companies, schools and the police; suicide notes, diaries of both Jewish and non-Jewish Berliners, as well as letters of soldiers to their spouses. The book also aims to synthesise existing but more specialised treatments of the history of Berlin in the twentieth century from a fresh angle. Different topics such as traffic, welfare, political leadership and suicides are addressed because contemporaries often did not treat them as separate areas but related them to the larger question of the meanings, consequences, and future prospects of individuality in a metropolis that was at the frontline of crucial twentieth-century conflicts.\n\nWhile the Weimar, Nazi, post-war and Cold War periods in Berlin were very specific and thus seem remote, several of the problems discussed and dealt with at the time are still of relevance: how to form social relations that respect and enhance individuality; how to reconcile the quest for freedom and mobility with the expectation of the receipt of personalised support; and, as the exclusion of Berlin Jews demonstrates, how to avoid that the pursuit of individual interests comes at the expense of vulnerable minorities. This project is thus of more than academic relevance, and aims to speak to contemporary debates regarding the character and status of individuality.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-05-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/53495092-C410-4DF9-83DC-9095F927EA29"><gtr:id>53495092-C410-4DF9-83DC-9095F927EA29</gtr:id><gtr:title>Individuality and Modernity in Berlin: Self and Society from Weimar to the Wall</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7feeef522d8af08b8234325d9f49b78d"><gtr:id>7feeef522d8af08b8234325d9f49b78d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Foellmer MJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-107-03098-5</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H003541/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
