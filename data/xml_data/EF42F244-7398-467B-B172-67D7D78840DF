This timely project therefore asks the question: what is the contribution of the comic form to the cultural heritage of these global experiences &amp;amp; what different kinds of historical meaning emerge? \n\nThe project research &amp;amp; the two major exhibitions that go with it - one on World War One comics at the Belgian Comic Strip Museum, &amp;amp; one on Second World War comics at London's Cartoon Museum- will emphasise to the heritage industry the potential of comics as a cultural artefact.\n\nMany people have childhood memories of comic strips and of following war stories with familiar characters on a regular basis. The comic format has now expanded from strips and magazines aimed at children, to books aimed at adults, spawning a new 'genre' of factually based stories. In France, where comics are referred to as the '9th art', a sub-genre of historical comics was sparked off by the publication of a 5 volume series depicting the journeys of an 18th century slave girl from the stormy coasts of Europe to Africa and then to the New World, all impeccably documented. It was followed by 'Paroles d'Etoiles'-the words of the star-a series of radio interviews with verbatim personal testimonials that were printed first in book form, followed by a comic book, as memories of hidden Jewish children who had fled the Holocaust &amp;amp; were forced to assume false identities to survive. \n\nIn the UK world war stories faded into decline from the mid 1980s, whereas Francophone and Asian comics are still being produced today. So, a transnational comparative approach to WW1 &amp;amp; WW2 strips may reveal different aspects of each country's experience as either undefeated, or occupied lands and peoples. Comics can be for children's educative purposes, or have a political message focused upon adult audiences, or contain covert propaganda 'hidden' in children's comics, such as German 'rats' taking over Belgium in Chlorophylle (1979), originally printed in the 1950s, and a golden fascist smurf ranting Mussolini style in Schtroumpfissime (1978). \n\nResearchers are examining the kind of views that comics offer in specific aspects of world war history that usually receive less attention, such as the endangered heritage of The Great War that has become overshadowed by the popular emphasis on World War 2. Is there a unique form of insight into the harsh realities of trench warfare or in comic depictions of heroes, enemy and victims? The 'Red Baron' &amp;amp; 'I Flew with Braddock' are good examples of heroes whereas 'Charley's War' and 'C'&amp;eacute;tait la Guerre des Tranches' depict the brutal war machine. \n\nResearchers are also investigating the relationship between creators, publisher &amp;amp; reader &amp;amp; the mutual influence upon each other, demonstrated by the long term survival of certain popular characters &amp;amp; formats. In addition, the project looks at ethnic issues through depictions of the Asian theatre of war as well as American black heroes, featured in the newspaper personae of 'Sergeant Joe' (1943), modelled on the boxer Joe Louis, and of 'Speedo Jaxon'. The role of women either as caring mothers or uniformed workers is being scrutinised; researchers will look at the way eye witness accounts &amp;amp; personal testimony interact with elements of illustrative fantasy in order to represent events that are 'un-representable' such as the Holocaust and Hiroshima. \n\nThus this project will open up a new area of debate, drawing attention publically to the need to revisit old comics. The message is that these cultural artefacts can offer a popular record of attitudes, feelings &amp;amp; character types. Findings are likely to suggest that the range of cultural archives used by historians as sources should be widened to include some factualcomics &amp;amp; that future 'public history' (now determined by popular film &amp;amp; TV) should also include them</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>2 major exhibitions are planned, each featuring our 4 research themes as they relate to that war. \n\na) 1WW Centenary Exhibition in partnership with the Belgian Comic Strip Center during 2014-18 at their premises in the centre of Brussels, to include original drawings donated by archive suppliers Egmont &amp;amp; Titan publishers.\n\nb) 2WW 75th Anniversary in partnership with The Cartoon Museum, London, 2015, at their premises adjacent to the British Museum, to include original drawings from archive supplier DC Thomson. \n\n1. Beneficiaries:\n*commercial private sector- comic festival organisers, publishers, specialist comic archive vendors (shops and internet).\n\n*government agencies- councils &amp;amp; arts organisations such as the Brussels Tourist Office, the heritage industry connected with the world wars, e.g. D Day museums,1WW battlegrounds, war grave sites &amp;amp; other heritage locations.\n\n*charities &amp;amp; interest groups such as The British Legion &amp;amp; the various 'federations d'anciens combatants' in Francophone countries.\n\n*archive holders &amp;amp; libraries who can display posters &amp;amp; leaflets about the event, &amp;amp; use it to propagate information about their own comic holdings.\n\n*other comic museums: MoCCA in New York &amp;amp; The Basle Museum of Comic Art for ideas on the content, display techniques &amp;amp; the collaboration between curators and academic experts.\n\n*wider comic public: amateur collectors &amp;amp; enthusiasts, people interested in the heritage of comics, collectors of childhood memorabilia, comic 'buffs'.\n\n*members of the public interested in public history depictions of The Great War &amp;amp; World War.\n\n 2. Impact timescales:\n*Immediate for contact with archive holders- researchers will search for original drawings to be displayed in the exhibitions from day one.\n\n*2013 onwards for promotion of the exhibitions, including work by the Brussels Tourist Office.\n\n*2014-18: the 1WW exhibition itself, with a press launch at the Comic Strip Center. The displays will appear alongside a series of other events at different points in the 4 year calendar.\n\n*2014:the start of promotion of the 2WW London exhibition.\n\n*2015 for the 2WW exhibition itself in London. \n\n3. Users' benefit: \na) the general public interested in the world wars who attend the exhibitions. Amongst London's smaller museums, The Cartoon Museum is the most visited. The Brussels venue (Europe's biggest comic centre) receives 200,000 visitors a year, many of whom are families. \n\nb) people with an interest in childhood memorabilia &amp;amp; comics will also attend the exhibitions. \n\nc) other museum &amp;amp; heritage industry stakeholders who will gain ideas for the use of comics as cultural artefacts &amp;amp; graphic display, e.g. how to juxtapose examples of reality such as photo archives with comic representations on the same theme. \n\nd) the Brussels Tourist office supporting the 1WW exhibition will gain anglophone (UK, British empire &amp;amp; US) content that will enhance an important cultural event for promotion to international visitors, extending the event's PR reach. \n\ne) trans-national benefits are accrued as part of the working relations between 2 national museums, &amp;amp; publisher archive holders as project partners - an interesting model for other scholars &amp;amp; heritage stakeholders. \n\nf) vendors of old comics (shops &amp;amp; internet) can advertise in exhibition catalogues. \n\ng) festival organisers (e.g.Angoul&amp;ecirc;me annual comic festival, ComicFest in London, MoCCA in NY) , publishers of comics &amp;amp; comic books (we have already researched 32 in the US) will all be able to advertise in the exhibition catalogue &amp;amp; also gain creative ideas. \n\n4. Transferable skill: the team will gain-\n*additional experience of exhibitions &amp;amp; of working with non-academic stakeholders\n\n* design &amp;amp; display skills\n\n* journalistic skills for writing simple, short display captions, summaries &amp;amp; catalogue information\n\n* more technic</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>456372</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>conference paper</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3C043AFA-3F4E-455C-95E0-958B42B16744</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation entitled ' Social movement comic strips as citizen's journalism, humour and cultural record'.

+It has demonstrated how these sources can be used for the study of both world wars by historians and other academics. 

+ Findings have acted as an indicator of nuanced personal issues and ideas relating to the world wars.
+Findings provide a cultural record of Home Fronts in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, particularly relevant to women's history and labour history. 

+ As such, the findings cross national, geographical and theoretical boundaries and the project has drawn attention to texts generally ignored by scholars of history and comic art.

+The project monograph, 'Comics and the World Wars: A Cultural Record' develops a methodological approach to the analysis of comics as an historical, cultural record. This methodology has advanced scholarship by outlining a number of categories for the study of comics as historical sources:

Subjectivity

Metaphorical aptness

Dynamic record

Mentalities

Verisimilitude

+The project has revealed how sequential illustrated narratives act as an historical, cultural record by:

-Offering a barometer for contemporary popular thinking.

-Using humour as a coping mechanism and a way to criticise authority.

-Promoting certain forms of behaviour and discouraging others.

-Representing a deliberately inclusive educational strategy for reading and disseminating wartime content, particularly by the American government during the latter conflict.

+The study has also exhibited how comics reflect the collective needs of varying social organisations and groups and reveal political and commercial organisations' specific messages and ideology during periods of total war. 

+In particular the project has presented close-readings of more obscure artists such as W.K. Haselden, artists from the left-wing press in America and Australia, and soldier artists from trench newspapers. 

+ The above in-depth studies have provided insights into some of the mentalities of total war, and of everyday life.

+ The publication 'Comics, the Holocaust, and Hiroshima' has broken new ground by arguing that comics have a triple role as sources of cataclysm between 1939 and 1945 and as testimony to Holocaust awareness, childhood trauma and emotions. 

+ In short, this part of the grant project has posited comics as an agent to build on the scholarship of new cultural history, historiography, memory and trauma studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>+ Scholars can use, build upon and develop the methodology and findings published in both the monograph publication 'Comics and the World Wars: A Cultural Record' and the publication 'Comics, the Holocaust, and Hiroshima'. 

+ This publication has demonstrated a new methodology based on close readings, but cross-referenced with other historical sources and - specifically - within the framework of new cultural history. 

+ As such, comics produced at the time of the world wars provide an invaluable source of historical information that elucidates nuanced elements of the culture and society of which they are products.

+The study has made a pioneering contribution to the studies of print, labour, gender and new cultural history and the expanding field of humour studies. 

+ Its focus on home front and front-line comics has drawn attention to texts previously ignored by scholars of history and comic art. By arguing for the significance of these texts, such as 'Wanda the War Girl' in connection with gender, the study has opened the door for further research in each of these fields. 

+The study has also argued for comics as a rich source of insight into everyday lives and mentalities across the English-speaking world in times of warfare and added these texts to the repertoire of sources that inform commemorative activities in the twenty-first century.

+ Scholars also can build upon the numerous engagement activities that have resulted from this project, particularly those conference talks and round-table discussions that are available internationally via the web on Youtube, Tedtalks and the Library of Congress. (NB: The URL attached to this page is only one such instance of these engagement activities). 

As a consequence of this project the findings are currently in the process of being taken forward in connection with the activities of the Everyday Lives in War Engagement Centre and the Centre for Hidden Histories. 

+ Most importantly, this project has developed and demonstrated a methodological approach to the analysis of comics as an invaluable and underprivileged historical and cultural record.

+ It has also analysed for the first time, a range of sources previously unknown to scholarship such as the amateur, soldier illustrated comics printed within the trench publications of the First World War. Scholars working on the Centenary and other allied research are already showing awareness of the importance of these findings and considering potential connections with existing historiography.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6981196A-EA8D-4D97-92FB-8E34EF897894</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and
