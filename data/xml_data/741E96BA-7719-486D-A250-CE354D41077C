 &lt;li>Development of an SDMX Dataset Description for 2011 Census Aggregate Outputs&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Supply of Additional dimensional datasets for testing of the ONS API&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Development of InFuse to Consume and Test ONS Web Service and API&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Development of RDF Descriptions of the 2001 and 2011 Censuses&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Development of similarity structures and measures for comparison of 2001 Census and 2011 Census datasets&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Census datasets are unique and extremely valuable information resources. A considerable amount of decision making of national and international importance across all sectors is based to some degree upon evidence provided by research using census information.

If the project is successful in achieving its aims, it will provide mechanisms to make more comprehensive and integrated census information available in ways that make it easier to understand, find information of relevance and use it appropriately. This will extend across the academic community and beyond through influence on the 2011 Census, and will stimulate increased and more effective use of census information by existing and new user communities. More research of higher quality will be produced, which will improve decision making, and result in numerous beneficial societal, economic and other impacts.

The methods developed by the project have relevance far beyond census datasets as they offer a potential for development of unifying data infrastructure to enable combined and comparative use of a wide range of important UK and international aggregate datasets via a new generation of interfaces offering users advanced and tailored functionality, with obvious dramatic impacts. This is the future information environment being anticipated and worked towards by the international information dissemination community, and which the CDU intends to continue to play a pioneering role in realising.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>198550</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Office for National Statistics (ONS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Production of test datasets for ONS WDA API</gtr:description><gtr:id>B306688D-443D-4DDE-A66D-4F2BA551602E</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>On the basis of work done on the CAIRD3 project to dimentionalise data from the 2001 Census, further work was done in collaboration with ONS to produce test datasets containing 2001 data formatted to resemble data anticipated from the 2011 Census.

Improvements in quality and delivery of information from the 2011 Census The project has directly influenced some aspects of ONS policy and practice to improve their management and delivery of information from the 2011 Census. Examples include the use of simpler and more consistent categorisations of variables, retention of cell numbering within census table frameworks and data outputs, and the production of bulk outputs to a widely accepted text format, rather than an obscure SDMX variant as originally proposed by ONS. These improvements will benefit users of 2011 census information across all sectors including the academic/scientific sector, and achieve impacts in greater and better quality research and decision making based on its use. These impacts also extend to 2011 census outputs produced by the other UK census agencies through ONS' lead. InFuse 2011 The benefits of InFuse 2011 described previously now extend beyond the academic sector following its launch in July 2013 as a public service. This has extended the range of impacts that InFuse 2011 is able to achieve by making the 2011 census aggregate outputs easier to find, understand and use to everyone.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3DF197C7-5E79-4A98-AFC2-21FE4E861049</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceu</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The CAIRD3 project builds upon a history of successful and productive co-funded collaboration between the then Dissemination Unit (CDU) (now part of the UK Data Service) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
