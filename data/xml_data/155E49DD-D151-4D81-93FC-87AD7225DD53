The whole process of Vision itself begins with a small group of proteins (known as opsins) which perform the unique task of absorbing light and translating it into an electrical/biological signal. In the retina, it was traditionally assumed that these opsins were confined to the rod and cone cells, known collectively as photoreceptors. These photoreceptor cells are the functional equivalent of the pixels in the CCD array of a digital camera. It has more recently been discovered that there is actually a rich diversity of additional candidate opsins produced in alternative cells in the retina, however their function remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, these same light sensitive proteins are also found in the brain in places like the pineal organ. Collectively these observations indicate that the whole process of light detection is far more complex than originally thought. Here in the current program we propose a systematic study of these potentially light sensing proteins by looking at the whole diverse opsin photopigment family in the zebrafish, a common model organism. Initially, we will insert the DNA that codes for these proteins into host cells grown in culture conditions. In this way we can measure and compare their functional properties as well as studying how they might interact with one another. This will allow us to define which of these possible photopigments can confer photosensitivity in cells which normally do not respond to light. Finally, it is very hard to measure the real function of these light sensitive proteins in the retina or brain because they are only found in relatively few cells and as a result they are simply very hard to find. We will therefore use new techniques to genetically modify zebrafish, so as to generate animals where the cells that normally produce these photopigments are modified to glow with a fluorescent marker. These approaches will help us explore and understand the whole range of new light detection mechanisms present in the eye and brain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In this proposal we seek to place the family of zebrafish novel opsins into a functional context. It is clear that the retina of vertebrates contain a whole family of non-rod/non-cone photopigments. Structurally these proteins resemble the known opsin photopigments but their function remains largely unexplored. Thus we propose to transiently express vertebrate ancient (VA) opsin; melanopsin (Opn4); encephalopsin (Opn3); neuropsin (Opn5); and teleost multiple tissue (TMT) opsin in our established N2A cell expression system allowing us to characterise the photopigment and/or photoisomerase potential of each of these candidate photopigments. If any of the candidate opsins fails to express photopigment characteristics we will examine their expression in other host cell lines, or in the presence of promiscuous G-protein binding partners. We will express these proteins as 6xHis-tagged opsins allowing us to use them in proteomic pull down assays to probe binding partners associated with signalling cascades; an approach we have adopted in studies of human-OPN4. We will use laser capture microdissection to examine the expression profile and co-expression propensity of the native pigments in the zebrafish retina using Q-PCR and cross correlation analysis. We already have evidence that some of the novel opsins are co-expressed in a sub-population of retinal neurones. We will therefore examine the extent of synergistic interaction in co-expression studies. Finally, we will generate transgenic animals where expression of EGFP under the control of specific opsin promoter sequences. These reporter animals will then be utilized to study the light driven responses of opsin expressing cells in both retinal and pineal preparations, where EGFP fluorescence will be used to guide recording electrodes. This will allow us to study the photopigment potential of this gene family in the native retinal and pineal environment and provide a functional profile for each photopigment candidate.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>961472</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>BBSRC Interim Progress Report 

The Melanopsin Gene Family

Melanopsin (opn4) exists of opn4x and opn4m isoforms. In the zebrafish we have found the presence of 5 distinct melanopsin genes and assigned them to different chromosomes. These genes clades into 2 groups, each formed by duplication of ancestral opn4x and opn4m isoforms suggesting their duplication and subsequent modification occurred early in teleost evolution. Since their discovery, we have isolated and cloned the 5 opn4 genes and shown their expression in the eye and brain. We have also shown that all five genes form functional photopigments, with representatives gives spectral peaks of absorbance close to 470-490 nm. Work is currently underway to determine the tuning sites that mediate the spectral differences between each of the melanopsin photopigments.



Functional analysis has shown that these pigments are capable of activating a Gq signalling pathway (thought to be the native melanopsin G protein cascade). Further analysis shows that this class of opsin exhibit both monostability (binding of 11-cis retinal only) and bistability (binding of 11-cis and all-trans retinal), a result that is novel as it is assumed all melanopsins are similar to the invertebrate rhodopsins and as such bistable. Work is on-going to determine the structural and biochemical basis for monostability vs bistability via the use of chimaeras and potentially X-ray crystallography. Collectively, the expression of all 5 opn4 genes was detected in all major classes of retinal cell, including a subset of cone photoreceptors, suggesting that the fish eye is globally photosensitive and may have a role in local adaptation to light via a calcium signalling cascade. 



The retina is usually described a duplex as it contains rods and cones. Our lab has shown this is not the case and a subset of RGCs are also photosensitive. The global photosensitive nature of the fish eye demonstrates that the 'duplex retina' nomenclature is in correct (overturning over 100 years of retinal research) and it is in fact a 'a multiplex retina'.



Many of the results of the melanopsin study are now published in in full (Davies et al., Functional diversity of melanopsins and their global expression in the teleost retina. 2011, Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences DOI: 10.1007/s00018-011-0785-4). Serial in situ sections have revealed expression of the melanopsins in the fish brain in areas not previously thought to be directly photosensitive (e.g. the optic tectum). The work is near completion and will be written up as a paper shortly.




Teleost Multiple Tissue (TMT) opsins

We have shown that the teleost tmt gene is in fact present in the zebrafish genome as 6 distinct genes, formed from the duplication of 3 major classes. These genes are also found in other teleosts, and akin to the melanopsins, these data suggest that multiple duplication of opsin genes occurred early in teleost evolution. 



In situ analysis shows they are all expressed in the eye, but also the brain, heart, and many other tissues. Functionally, they do not appear to activate a Gq or Gs signalling pathway. Nonetheless, they are able to form pigments that spectrally are UV sensitive (the first non-visual opsin in fish to be shown to be spectrally tuned to UV wavelengths). Also, these pigments are UV sensitive with both 11-cis and all-trans retinal and as such as bistable. Work is on-going to determine the molecule basis for this UV sensitivity, which appears to be completely different form the mechanism used by UV sensitive visual pigments. Genomic analysis shows that these tmt genes have orthologues that are found in most vertebrates, including monotreme and marsupial mammals.



Novel Classes of Zebrafish Opsins

This project has resulted in the discovery of a number of completely new and novel opsin classes that appear to be most closely related to the opn5 group and tentatively termed opn6, opn7 opn8 and opn9. Genomic analysis shows that these genes have distinct genome structures and orthologues are found in most vertebrates, including monotreme mammals. Work is on-going to determine their expression profile and functional characteristics, including the generation of a number of antibodies for ICC analysis of protein location. Spectrally, this group of pigments exhibit very different biochemistries (e.g. monostability vs bistability; monophasic vs biphasic; UV vs green light sensitivity). This analysis is near completion and a comprehensive paper is currently under preparation.



Summary 

With six months now remaining, our project has now reached an important phase in publishing principal findings. Our work has been presented at major international meetings including: The Gordon Research Conference (Circadian, 2011), the Rank Prize Trust (2011) and the European Biological Rhythms Society (2011). Our first full paper characterising the diverse family of five distinct melanopsin (opn4) genes in zebrafish has been published this year (Davies et al., Functional diversity of melanopsins and their global expression in the teleost retina. 2011, Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences DOI: 10.1007/s00018-011-0785-4) and several major papers are in an advanced stage of preparation. We are close to completing a comprehensive opsin profile of a remarkable family of 43 non-visual opsins in the zebrafish genome. We are currently examining the tissue expression profile of the entire opsin family using high-throughput nanostring technology to provide the first opsinomic g protein profile.
