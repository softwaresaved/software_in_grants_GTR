When visuals are used to represent information the specific choice of representation will greatly influence the insights that can be gained from the displayed information and, as a consequence, greatly affect our decision-making. 
Appropriate use of visuals and exploitation of their effectiveness therefore plays a majour role at any level of the society.

Visualization has been shown very effective in understanding large, complex data, and thus has become an indispensable tool for many areas of research and practice.
With the current era of data deluge, also known as Big Data, the creation of highly expressive visual encoding of information is therefore critical to be able to support the process of analysis, exploration, and presentation of data for knowledge discovery and decision making. 

Development of new and improved visualization methods for managing content and structure of large dataset is therefore a topical research focus; one needed to effectively make sense and maximize utilization of such vast amounts of data, there is a need of new sets of tools beyond conventional techniques, tools capable of leveraging the power of standard data analysis techniques such as data mining and statistical analysis.

In this project we propose glyph based visual encoding as a possible solution to tackle the challenge of Big Data analysis. 
Glyph-based visualization is a common form of visual design where a data set is depicted by a collection of visual objects referred to as glyphs, representations conceptually similar to icons or signs.
Glyph-based visualization is still an under-explored field with great potentials, therefore, we aim at developing a comprehensive framework for the classification and deployment of glyph-based visual designs in the context of large datasets (e.g. Big Data). Fundamental to our research will be the application of graphics and perception rules to the process of associating data, and information they carry, to visual encodings and visual encodings to analytical tasks.
Visual perception plays an important role in the area of visualization, appropriate application of perception principles can significantly improve both the quality and the quantity of information being displayed, and directly impact a viewer's efficiency and effectiveness while performing analytical tasks such as: target search, pattern recognition, anomalies or recurring event detection.
 
In the data deluge of the modern era, interdisciplinary collaboration is also an absolute necessity for identification, extraction and visualization of pertinent data. By creating context sensitive tools, it is possible to significantly expedite the analytical process with solutions optimized for individuals knowledge base and expertise. For this reason we aim to validate and refine results at each step of our work with real case studies scenarios. We will be focusing in particular to datasets generated by Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) simulations. Lattice QCD simulations are pivotal to solve fundamental problems in high energy and nuclear physics such as the understanding of internal structure of nucleons, determine the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, such as those that existed immediately after the &amp;quot;Big Bang&amp;quot; and are reproduced today in relativistic simulation experiments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Studies show that visual stimuli such as images are processed by the brain 60,000 faster than text.

With the current era of data deluge the creation of highly expressive visual encoding of information is critical to be able to gain insight from the vast amount of information available. For current analytical tools this represent a challenge.
Given the broad spectrum of what is now known as the Big Data challenge, opportunities for deploying effective data visualization solutions continue to grow. Based on the aims of the project we envisage several beneficiaries:

1. Researchers and Practitioners involved in Big Data analytics.

The proposed research aims at advancing data visualization techniques to help scientists and other professionals involved in data-analysis related tasks to identify trends, patterns and relationships in the data they are working with. We aim at creating a novel visualization paradigm especially tailored to applications involving large, complex data sets and analytical processes that require a high degree of expressiveness from the visual encoding.

2. Researchers in other disciplines areas such as medicine and natural sciences. 

The strong theoretical framework represent a contribution which goes beyond the scope of the project. The set of guidelines and the final taxonomy will constitute a solid base upon which several research fields can build their own application-oriented visual layout. The proposal current main recipients are researchers in Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), however any research field dealing with large multidimensional and multivariate datasets could benefit from the project's same theoretical results. 

3. Students and general public.
The project main objective is to develop novel solutions to support the analysis of extremely large datasets (e.g. Big Data). The knowledge acquired throughout the project could easily become integral part of training courses on Big Data analytics. 
The development of a prototype may attract interest from data analytics companies, and become a commercializable solution.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98790</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop: C4PGV Creation, Curation, Critique and Conditioning of Principles and Guidelines in Visualization</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4980FE12-3E5F-4438-A502-201AF156B7FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop was co-located with with IEEE VIS 2016, on Oct 23th, in Baltimore, MD, USA. Through this channel we were able to capture a large and heterogeneous audience. 
The primary goals and outcome of the workshop workshop have been:
- presentation of new Visualization guidelines and principles
- fostering the discussions of principles and guidelines in an open, democratic, and evidence-based manner
- creation, curation (including examples of their uses and misuses), critique (including revision and improvement) and conditioning (i.e., education, training and deployment) of Principles and Guidelines in Visualization
- stimulate a dialogue on novel approaches and community effort for supporting and systemizing the Creation, Curation, Critique and Conditioning activities through a cost-effective and sustainable mechanism.

The workshop has created an ongoing debate and a community effort on the design of a common repository to support curation and critique of visualization design principles.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://c4pgv.swansea.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dagstuhl Seminar 15481, &quot;Evaluation in the Crowd: Crowdsourcing and Human-Centred Experiments&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6556FC48-90FE-4330-B4D3-55AC1798F077</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Forty international researchers and practitioners met for a 5 day workshop at Schloss Dagstuhl to discuss experiences and methodological considerations when using crowdsourcing platforms to run human-centred experiments.
