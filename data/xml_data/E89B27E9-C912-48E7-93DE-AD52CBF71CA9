Originally all cells (blastomeres) within the embryo are the same and have equal potential to form any of the cell types in the future foetus. From around the 8-cell stage, a process of differentiation begins and blastomeres gradually become committed to one of the first three cell lineages: the trophectoderm (TE) and the primitive endoderm (PrE), which both contribute to the placenta, and the pluripotent epiblast (EPI), which gives rise to the foetus. At the blastocyst stage, the TE consists of a single layer of cells ('epithelium') enclosing both a fluid-filled cavity and an adjacent inner cell mass (ICM). By the late blastocyst stage, the PrE appears as a noticeable layer of cells on the surface of the ICM lining the cavity, with deeper cells comprising the epiblast. TE and PrE form extra-embryonic tissues required for nutrient exchange and for the induction of the body axis of the embryo. Both ICM and EPI are sources of continually self-renewing embryonic stem cells, which can be induced to differentiate into specific cell types such as cardiac, neural or endocrine lineages in culture and thus offer enormous prospects in the field of regenerative medicine. Therefore, extending our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying cell lineage specification and cellular reprogramming during normal development is not only crucial for understanding mammalian development but also for the advance of cell-based therapies of such diseases as diabetes or Parkinson's disease. Preimplantation mouse embryos provide an excellent model for studying lineage specification in a three-dimensional context. The development of TE and ICM has been extensively studied and it was shown that cell polarity and the associated asymmetric (differentiative) divisions of the 8-cell stage and 16-cell stage blastomeres are critical to differentiation of these two lineages. Thus far, however, segregation of PrE and EPI has received comparatively little attention. The work proposed here aims to understand the role of cell polarity and polarity proteins during PrE vs. EPI specification. We plan to investigate the process of epithelialisation during PrE formation and to test whether interfering with a cell's ability to polarise can influence its contribution to PrE or EPI. Our research will help to extend our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying lineage specification during normal development. Furthermore, it will help to define the optimal environments for maintaining cell-type stability and inducing effective differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Primitive endoderm (PrE) is the second tissue to differentiate from a pluripotent cell population during mammalian development. It emerges as a conspicuous epithelial-like layer on the surface of the inner cell mass lining the cavity. Deeper cells comprise the pluripotent epiblast (EPI), which gives rise to the embryo proper. In this grant proposal we plan to study the process of epithelium formation during PrE differentiation and to determine the roles of cell polarity and polarity proteins in EPI vs. PrE cell fate decisions. First, we will characterise epithelialisation during PrE formation by describing the dynamic localisation of polarity proteins (aPKC, Par3, Jam-1, E-cadherin) and their relation to tight-junction proteins (such as occludin or ZO-2), PrE- and EPI-specific markers (Gata4, Gata6, Nanog) and other proteins known to play a role in PrE formation (Lpr2, Dab2, Col-IV). We will then interfere with the function of the polarity protein aPKC and assess its effect on PrE formation. We will block aPKC activity globally using inhibiting drugs or within a clonal sub-population of cells by single-cell injection at the late morula stage of either mRNA for a dominant negative form of aPKC or dsRNA against aPKC. The effects of increased aPKC signalling will be studied by overexpressing an active form of aPKC containing a membrane localisation signal. We will monitor the effects of interfering with aPKC on cell behaviour by confocal microscopy and real-time imaging. Finally, we will overexpress and knock-down (RNAi) PrE- and EPI-specific markers (Gata4, Gata6, Nanog) and we will assess the effects of this interference on PrE epithelialisation. Combining gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments using a novel panel of reporter strains (allowing us to visualise PrE and EPI cells within the ICM) will help to generate high resolution data describing cell behaviour and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying fate decisions during normal development.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>409219</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>participation in public engagement event: Wellcome to the matrix 2010</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D50E51B3-1882-4C0E-A48D-0D9A1B29B833</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organise demonstration of confocal images and time-lapse movies picturing developing mouse embryos.

 First, we confirmed the presence of polarity proteins in early embryos at the stages when PrE and EPI are formed. Using immunochemistry (the technique used to localise proteins in the cells), we found that the polarity protein known as atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) is enriched in PrE precursors before they are sorted to their appropriate position. This enrichment is specific to PrE cells since blocking PrE formation by interfering with FGF/ERK signalling removes any differences in aPKC distribution between ICM cells. Next we established that blocking aPKC activity impairs the organisation of the PrE as a polarised layer and affects the survival of PrE precursors. aPKC inhibition also perturbs the nuclear localisation of GATA4, a marker of mature PrE cells, which in turn affects the process of epithelialisation and formation of mature PrE. We found that down-regulation of Gata4 causes a phenotype similar to aPKC inhibition and impairs sorting of PrE and EPI precursors. Our results suggest that aPKC plays an important role in segregation of PrE from the embryonic lineage (EPI). 
We also found that another polarity-related protein, E-cadherin, is differentially distributed in PrE and EPI cells at the end of the process of lineage formation. E-cadherin is uniformly distributed on the membrane of EPI cells, whereas in PrE cells it is excluded from the part of the membrane facing the blastocyst cavity. Previously published data suggested that differences in cell adhesion may contribute to sorting of PrE and EPI. As E-cadherin is one of the most important proteins that regulate cell adhesion in early embryos, we decided to test whether interfering with E-cadherin function can disrupt the process of PrE and EPI segregation. We found that even after cell adhesion was altered PrE and EPI precursors were able to form separate layers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We presented our data on several conferences and
