&lt;p>The study begins from the starting point that identity matters. Political symbols play an important role in encouraging mass arousal and quiescence. The recent riots over the flying of the Union flag in Belfast highlight the potency of identity triggers. The role that identity will play in the forthcoming referenda in Scotland and Catalonia is heavily debated. The question of identity is also central to the ongoing debate about UK membership of the European Union. However, identity is complex and is not easily captured in standard surveys which ask, for example, how 'Scottish', 'Portuguese', 'Bavarian' or European an individual feels. Identity has an implicit as well as an explicit dimension. Using an innovative neuropolitics approach the project aims to enrich current understandings of identity and the role it plays in multi-level polities like the European Union.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Public Impact of the Project:

The ESRC Implicit Triggers pilot project (RES-000-22-4348, PI Laura Cram (with Co-Investigators Stratos Patrikios and James Mitchell) upon which this proposal builds, generated considerable user and media interest. Following an approach from the BBC, the implicit triggers team launched a highly successful collaboration with the BBC using the experimental survey methods to be further developed in this project. The BBC experiment demonstrated the differential effect of implicit exposure to the various UK flags on participants' political attitudes. Over 10,500 members of the UK public took part in a survey experiment developed by the researchers and publicised on the BBC website. The subsequent BBC coverage on the Daily Politics and Sunday Politics programmes was widely disseminated by viewers on Youtube, Facebook and Twitter as well as being covered in the traditional print press. A similar degree of public and media interest in the proposed project is anticipated, but on a cross-national scale. The Principal investigator's media contacts have already indicated that the extension of the Implicit Triggers project into the field of cognitive neuroscience will be of likely further media interest. 

The Policy Impact of the Project:
The display of national flags and symbols is highly controversial. The recent riots over the flying of the Union flag in Belfast highlight the potency of identity triggers. The role that identity will play in the forthcoming referenda in Scotland and Catalonia is heavily debated. The question of identity is also central to the ongoing debate about UK membership of the European Union. On the EU flag, the Head of the European Parliament's Information Office commented, in response to the results of the Implicit Triggers project: 'You cannot imagine how much time is spent arguing about the EU flag here at Europe House'. The breadth of the policy relevance of this type of research was evidenced by the affiliations of the attendees at the user engagement events held for the Implicit Triggers project. Attendees included representatives from the European Commission, DG Regio, DG Comms and the Citizens' Europe Unit, Eurodesk, the European Movement and the Scottish government. The extended disciplinary and geographic reach of the current project will extend further the range of user bodies to which the research will be of direct policy relevance.

The proposed research on the impact of implicit identity triggers, in different national and multi-national contexts, is also likely to be of specific interest to those involved, for example, in electoral campaigns. Reviewers of the implicit triggers research outputs have noted, for example, that the research has clear implications for those designing 'how to vote cards' given to people on their way to a polling station to cast their vote, or for those responsible for designing campaign posters used in the lead up to elections. The project will moreover help to illuminate the hitherto little explored intersection of identity, emotion and reasoning among, for example, voters and decision makers.

Impact on the Academy: 
Part of the remit of Laura Cram's post is to develop the field of Neuropolitical research in the University. This underlines the University's strong commitment to the promotion of transformative social science research in this field. Already an established Professor with a PhD in political science, Cram elected to develop her own skill-set and the Neuropolitics agenda by undertaking additional MSc training in neuroimaging at Edinburgh University. Edinburgh, with its existing strengths in pol sci, human cognitive neuropsych and integrated neuroscience, cognitive science, experimental and behavioural economics and neuroimaging, provides the ideal environment to support Professor Cram in the development and critique of neuropolitics as a growing field and in the training of young researchers in this field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200128</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Behavioural Insights Team presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E029AA74-A5B8-48E0-8713-CD55869C07B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk provoked discussion about potential future collaborations

This is now a permanent infrastructure for continued neuropolitical research innovation at the interface between the social, natural and psychological sciences. We have had considerable media exposure for our neuropolitics research (BBC Radio 4, BBC Scotland, World Service, BBC 5 Live, BBC Wales) and direct interest in our work from campaign organisations and policy makers. Our research has also generated considerable public and media interest. Our facebook page has over 600 followers. We have also developed a dedicated web site http://www.pol.ed.ac.uk/neuropoliticsresearch. We collaborated on a BBC Documentary on psychology of campaigning Mind Games, 15 July 2014 http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04fgqzd. Our research was presented to the Behavioural Insights Team in the Cabinet Office, 1 April 2015. We have been invited to give talks to PwC staff and clients, to the business organisation London First as well as to provide a training session for Scottish Parliament staff. We have been approached by CORE mediation to investigate how our neuropolitical approach might feed into the mediation training process. We have had a number of meetings with civil servants in the Scottish executive, interested in our methods and in our approaches to understanding public attitudes. This ESRC project led directly to an approach from CrowdEmotion http://www.crowdemotion.co.uk to collaborate. We have subsequently conducted a collaborative emotion coding experiment with these industry partners on the EU referendum campaign (subsequently funded by the ESRC). This collaboration with CrowdEmotion will extend significantly as we gear up for further studies on the forthcoming Scottish elections and the EU referendum.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9AA13B67-FD3B-4DFC-9106-B1574A3695BD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We demonstrate in our study that identity matters in practice in relation to strategic decision-making. We also find evidence of physiological indicators of collective identity effects. We used a series of behavioural, hormonal (salivary Testosterone and Alpha Amylase) and neural measures (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging). In a study run in Catalonia and Scotland, we find evidence that the identity of the partner in an economic ultimatum game impacts on the amount of money that participants were willing to offer or to accept, on their responses to low monetary offers from their partners, and on their subsequent behaviours in the game. We also find that physiological measures of salivary Testosterone and Alpha Amylase have predictive capacity in relation to participants' some aspects of strategic behavior in an economic ultimatum game. We also demonstrate that the effect of the observed hormonal shifts on participants' behaviour is moderated by the partnering of a responder with their self-identified primary territorial in-group (for example a Scot partnered with a Scot, rather than with an English partner, or a Catalonian with a Catalonian, rather than with someone who views themselves as primarily European). The specific responses observed differ across cultures between Spain and the UK, but in both cases indicate a role for territorial identity markers in shaping decision behaviours. 

At a neural level we conducted a stag-hunt experiment in an fMRI scanner, to investigate the impact of partner identity on cooperation and trust. Findings support theories of multiple identities. Differential brain activation in response to cooperation and defection in the stag hunt game was found when Scots players believed themselves to be partnered with English and European identifiers but not with UK identifiers. We also a conducted a pain-empathy fMRI study, examining the impact of implicit exposure to the national flag on an individuals empathy for others. During an fMRI sequence, participants viewed a series of videos of individuals experiencing shoulder pain and were asked to rate both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness. Individuals in each video were presented as either the same nationality as participants or a different nationality. An implicit prime was also displayed, which was either the participants' national flag or a scrambled control flag. Symbols of nationality, even when presented implicitly, had a significant effect on brain activation in response to viewing others in pain, over and above explicit nationality markers.

The extent to which 'heart' or 'head' rules in strategic and political decision-making is heavily debated in both popular and academic circles. This dominated the debate in the context of the Scottish referendum and this is likely to be repeated in UK membership of the EU membership, for example. The issue of the role played by territorial/national identity has been closely associated with this debate. Our experimental manipulation of the interaction between contextual territorial identity cues, physiological responses and strategic decision-making provides a novel approach to addressing these questions. We have also produced a research design that can be adapted for application to other multi-level polities and in comparative context.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>At the academic level, the PI is developing a further fMRI protocol examining the impact of territorial identity on the experience of social exclusion. She has also begun to collaborate with colleagues in informatics and psychiatry, to explore how these interdisciplinary approaches to collective identities can be developed further and used by others. At a policy level, the PI has given a presentation to the Behavioural Insights Team, linked to the Cabinet Office, exploring how the methods and techniques employed by the applicant might be applied practically in their policy work. Interest in the research from business leaders has been high. The PI has been invited: to give a presentation to Price Waterhouse Cooper (pwc UK) and invited clients, on the potential of the methods developed for analysis of political campaigns and public relations strategies, but also on the potential for wider application - for example in the advertising field; and to address a round table of senior business leaders organized by London First, to discuss the insights from this. Given the forthcoming UK referendum on EU membership, interest in these novel approaches to understanding citizen attitudes and behaviours in multi-level polities will be of considerable interest at the political level.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4E1163DE-F418-4FD1-8674-12BC571C6699</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D796549E-8F3A-4A1C-971F-BC6DC2A5C40A"><gtr:id>D796549E-8F3A-4A1C-971F-BC6DC2A5C40A</gtr:id><gtr:title>European identity revisited: new approaches and recent empirical evidence</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/002a54ef91746f0864408e1ce676cd9d"><gtr:id>002a54ef91746f0864408e1ce676cd9d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LAURA CRAM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-138-88636-0</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B11DBB9D-C43C-49A3-986B-4B87BEF84DC0"><gtr:id>B11DBB9D-C43C-49A3-986B-4B87BEF84DC0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Research Methods in European Union Studies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/02f647ecff0a15a65873468b00d5e32e"><gtr:id>02f647ecff0a15a65873468b00d5e32e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cram L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/31273646-1E1C-4C3C-9DA4-D6F801C56CD3"><gtr:id>31273646-1E1C-4C3C-9DA4-D6F801C56CD3</gtr:id><gtr:title>What I Do, Not What I Say?
