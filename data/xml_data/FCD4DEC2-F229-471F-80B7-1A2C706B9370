&lt;p>Many organisations, from large national charities to small local voluntary groups, work to improve circumstances for people with sight loss.

 &lt;li>Collaboration and Networking: a network establishing sustainability by developing ongoing collaboration and cooperation beyond this project.&lt;/li>

People with sight loss - in general
Local and national sight loss organisations will be acting on evidence that is routed in the experiences of blind and partially sighted respondents. The sight loss sector will become more engaged with data about the health and financial wellbeing of people with sight loss. Improved performance of sight loss organisations (more efficient, less wasteful of resource, more relevant and better informed) will enable them to better equip people with sight loss to engage with and influence local issues that are important to them. 

People with sight loss - specific
A proportion of the members of staff taking part in both the professional and workforce development will have personal experience of sight loss, as does one member of the core team. Thus all products and governance will be accessible to allow full participation. Furthermore, one unemployed person with sight loss will gain a paid job, work-related training, and a combination of skills that will enable him/her, should they want to, to continue to contribute valuable skills relevant to the future performance of the sector. 

Local organisations working in the sight loss sector 
Will benefit from being better informed about the profile and the needs of their client group, having greater authority for lobbying because they are armed with good quality evidence, better prepared to demonstrate need in applications for service funding, and having a more engaged and better connected workforce.

National organisations working in the sight loss sector
Will gain financial efficiency from being able to bring some social research work in-house, informed targeting and better specfication for any work commisioned externally, and greater connections with others using sight loss research and data.

The sight loss sector as a whole
Will gain from improved connections between organisations operating at local, regional and national levels.

NatCen Social Research 
Gains in terms of developed familarity with secondary analysis resources and a greater understanding of the research needs of the sight loss sector and third sector organisations more widely, at local and national level. Also in terms of ensuring research outputs are accessible and usable by the range of sight loss sector organisations. 

Other research providers
Academics and other research providers benefit from better specified research tenders, a developed understanding of the research needs of third sector organisations, and developed connections with others working in related fields.

Other third sector organisations
This project explicitly seeks to develop models of working that have direct relevance to promoting knowledge exchange and social research utilisation in sectors working to support other client groups.

Public sector and NHS commisioners
Will benefit from better evidenced funding applications for public services that more accuractely reflect the needs and preferances of people with sight loss.

Wider public
Campaign and awareness advertising will be better informed with authorative evidence based on existing UK research. Money donated by the public to support sight loss charities will therefore be better targetted.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>55354</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Visionary</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership between the Knowledge Exchange Network project team and Visionary</gtr:description><gtr:id>99ADF8AC-739F-469A-934D-DD56E316C794</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Informal ongoing data support provided by national representatives to local organisations; and national representaives have learnt about local data needs.

The model of disseminating knowledge gained from research through local events is one we continued to use for sharing the results the RNIB My Voice survey. We did seven events across England to reach individuals in local roles within the sight sector. Pocklington were partners in a number of these. 

The digital 'Knowledge Hub' continues to share research and data with people in the sight loss sector and beyond and gets a large number of hits each month. The Knowledge Hub continues to be the route by which people access the Sight Loss Data Tool, which has now had more than 10,000 downloads. The 'Knowledge Exchange Network' is still up and running and we share monthly updates with an email group of over a thousand people and regular post to the KEN linked-in group.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0A294D56-CFBA-4965-95E3-47F8A0AE072A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This Knowledge Exchange grant has supported an extraordinary year of collaboration, bringing together a now close-knit project team of sight loss research professionals from different organisations (including RNIB and Pocklington Trust) with methodologists from NatCen Social Research. We are continuing to work together.

Together we have raised the profile of and carried out training in applying data and research on sight loss with: a) professionals working in national and umbrella sight loss organisations; b) professionals working in local sight loss organisations; c) generalist researchers; and d) a blind trainee.

We have achieved this through several strands of linked work:
i. A programme of day-long regional workshop/conferences aimed at people working at the local level, in addition to other professional development events. 
ii. Two sets of five day social research training programmes, conducted over a six-month period, with people working at the national level.
iii. Development and continuation - sustainable because integrated into Pocklington Trust and RNIB's own communication infrastructure - of a LinkedIn group providing ongoing advice and support, and an email circulation group (now with more than 7,000 registered recipients) of people who regularly receive sight loss Research News.

Through our work on this knowledge exchange grant we have learnt about the research and support needs across the range of groups of people that we were working with (at local, regional, national level; without and outside of the sight loss sector) - this has informed how we accessibly pitch and most usefully target ongoing work in this area. 

One key transferable finding for future public engagement and knowledge exchange activity has been the key importance of engaging at the LOCAL level. This came back strongly in our evaluation survey and depth interview work with participants from the regional seminars. They particularly appreciated the opportunity to develop local networks, meeting people working in related fields and in neighbouring organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- We have further work in the sight loss sector to do: promoting availability of and findings from analyses of the latest waves of key longituidnal survey datasets (including the Life Opportunities Survey, Understanding Society and the Millennium Cohort Study); updating the Sight Loss Data Tool; training more central sector professionals and conducting further professional development events; ongoing maintenance of the network; and applying learning to the support of another blind or partially sighted trainee. 
- We are also continuing to promote sight loss as an area of substantive research for generalist social researchers to address, and a topic that survey researchers should include good questions on when survey samples are sufficiently large to support this focus in analysis.
- But a key application will be to apply the model developed to other sectors, in particular working with other organisations with a research remit in different areas of the disability sector, such as hearing impairment. Supporting this was a focus of our recent workshop at the SRA annual conference.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3E2675B6-F02B-4E4A-AADE-295F4F8DE27B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.pocklington-trust.org.uk/researchandknowledge/Sightlossguidanceandinformationforprofessionals/ken</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evaluation feedback from participants</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F4D144DD-FCE7-42DE-BC98-55F2A0B2788E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This grant has involved a significant training programme for national sight loss sector professionals and regional workshops for many local sight loss sector professionals, sustained with ongoing data support, networks, and access to data tool.

The Sight Loss Data Tool is a key resource for the sight loss sector and has been used by over 3,000 individuals since it was launched in 2013. 
Stuart Clayton, the Chief Executive of Galloway's, provided the following feedback after using the Sight Loss Data Tool: 

&amp;quot;I have used the data to influence the Lancashire LEHN in the development of the sight loss pathway, the Health and Wellbeing Boards regarding the general prevalence of sight loss and in Sefton we included data in our bid to the CCG small grants programme and as a consequence we were awarded &amp;pound;40k for the development of a new early intervention project.

&amp;quot;The sight loss data tool has enabled me to speak with confidence about the prevalence of sight loss and the associated costs at recent CCG AGM's and in turn this has raised the profile of sight loss in Lancashire and Sefton. The RNIB sight loss data tool is an excellent capacity builder for organisations such as Galloway's to raise the profile of sight loss in a challenging and ever changing environment.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Sight Loss Data Tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.rnib.org.uk/knowledge-and-research-hub-key-information-and-statistics/sight-loss-data-tool</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002000/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2093C2F8-C10A-40EE-A71D-387F3BA92968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Kinship Health &amp; relatedness</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>189E1F60-BF95-405D-A6F0-62BBD78E2DD5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Survey &amp; Monitoring</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
