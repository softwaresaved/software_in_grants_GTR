Findings from these projects will be disseminated and publicised to all local authorities in the UK, promoting a new mode of service delivery for enhancing health and wellbeing in complex living environments .

 Project participants will be within the oversight and services of local authorities and councils will be helping to broker the activity within their provider frameworks. The arts practices comprise a cultural product called 'Performing Place' which has been developed and tested in previous practical research projects with vulnerable groups affiliated with, and engaged via, arts organisations. Building on that project, in this new development we have consulted on priority areas within local councils who have identified a future need for such work. Two practical projects will be planned, one in Camden and one in Oldham, working between Arts leaders and other departments, Mental Health in Camden and Stronger Communities in Oldham. Both the planning and delivery period will include working with local council representatives, key workers and leading artist/facilitator practitioners with the new end users. 

 In Camden we will work in at least one Council-owned area of the Supported Living Programme, in buildings that house those with need of 'stepping stone' support to live more independently and whose cultural engagement may also be at the lower end of the spectrum within the Borough (which is an indicator of health and wellbeing). We will run 15 weekly sessions based in the residences, engaging adults with their current and potential 'place'. 

 In Oldham, we will work in the ward of Clarksfield with long-term residents and comparatively newly arrived Roma residents, assuaging disharmonies arising from different cultural understandings within the same local community. This work will follow a different model of Performing Place practice - a week's intensive engagement rather than weekly, workshops (as in Camden) - and will take place over a week in the summer of 2016. 

 In the planning and delivery of the projects, we will work with specialist lead facilitators following and adapting models used in the previous project, 'Challenging concepts of &amp;quot;liquid&amp;quot; place through performing practices in community contexts', 2011-2014 (Challenging Place). Such activities will include a range of improvisation and performance-related activities that are shaped from everyday operations and behaviours. None of the participants are likely to be performers but the activities are non-threatening, accessible and shaped to raise levels of cultural engagement where there may be existing barriers. This is an important part of Performing Place, that it can be accessed by participants without particular skill or experience in performance. (See http://www.performingplaces.org/placepracsitesotw.html for example.) 

 The impact and engagement of these two follow-on projects will be formally documented in line with local authority reporting and disseminated via simple web pages on the existing site, three symposia and a 32-page document (with executive summary). This document will be sent to the 400+ local authorities in the UK with the intention that such practice be promoted and assimilated for use in other priority areas. Two symposia will take place in London and Manchester with representatives from all nearby local authority councils invited, as well as nationally. A third symposium will take place for the 33 members of London Arts Forum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement project will increase the effectiveness and impact of public services and influence policy by demonstrating an enhancement to the quality of life of participants through their creative engagement. Impact can be summarised in the following areas:

- Programme beneficiaries. 
Each of the two sets of participants is expected to benefit directly from the practical projects, reporting changes in attitude to place, aspirations and wellbeing. In Camden, residents will be those previously unable to live on their own (such as those with mental health issues, learning difficulties or lack of confidence) and in Supported Living. Many will have been homeless. Performing Place activities are designed as non-threatening 'extensions' to the everyday where performative activities will be guided by skilled artist facilitators to increase independence in new or existing places. Findings from the previous project suggest that such activities will develop new place attachments. In Clarksfield, Oldham, impact will be supported by local community leading figures from different cultures in Oldham. Participants from approximately five streets in Clarksfield will take part in a week-long performing place project which will be promoted to the surrounding areas to increase public engagement and footfall for wider safer neighbourhood impact and profile-raising. Within this project a range of activities will take place that invite residents to re-envision their physical locality, subverting it, enriching it in people's minds through 'performing' it and, subsequently, creating a 'plural' neighbourhood where different cultural behaviours are accepted by longer term residents.

- Local authorities
We are looking to establish a blueprint and advocate a step-change in public service delivery frameworks and how the two councils may consider Performing Place in partnership with other areas of the public agenda priority areas (e.g. regeneration, health and wellbeing). This is with a longer term view to placing it at strategic planning and commissioning level. As a key to service enhancement and individual and community ownership, we anticipate Performing Place becoming a useful contributor to achieving local authority targets as will be evidenced in Camden and Oldham. With the dissemination of a final report document nationally, and following the summative symposia in London and Manchester, we are committed to extending this work further.

- Arts practitioners.
PI Mackey will work alongside arts facilitators who have experience in her Performing Place activities and facilitating work with participants from the previous projects. Together, they will 'train' further facilitator practitioners to work in this way, utilising documentation gathered from the previous projects in Challenging Place. Those with experience will benefit from passing on skills as well as further experimentation opportunities. Those new to some of the techniques and thinking will learn new ideas and how to work with these in less familiar (and challenging) public contexts. It is anticipated that this network of practitioners will be extended in future projects.

- Service Providers
It is expected that service providers will be exposed to the performing place cultural offer in the short space of the project. This will promote the longer-term use and function of specialised arts interventions as a way of supporting holistic council efficiencies (e.g. decreasing the period needed for adults to remain in supported living projects will be explicit). It is anticipated that voluntary and community sector key workers will actively pursue such projects in consultation with their authority, as well as network about the impact and the benefits of the work with the participants, thus leading to expanded opportunities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77375</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In Oldham, a week-long participatory, interactive performance narrative took place in one neighbourhood (Clarksfield) experiencing population change, with longer-established residents and new migrants. EARTHED project had contact with around 1000 participants; with a longer gestation period followed by one week of intensive project. The project intended to make use of, expand and develop performing place practices where physical places are subverted, shifted, given profile and reframed through a range of different kinds of performance-related events. Such activities re-engage people with their locality and environment, easing and improving people's feelings in their location. A narrative was developed to frame the week's intensive arts project. Two visitors and their baby - beings from another planet - were teleported down from their spacecraft into Clarksfield as part of a scheduled stop in their space journeying. They were tourists, seeking knowledge and experience of Clarksfield as well as finding fuel for their spacecraft. Fuel was gathered - or 'sucked' - from positive energy to be found in people and the area. At the end of the week, they would return to their spacecraft from a launch pad to travel home.
This narrative served several functions:
? Welcoming 'aliens' to Clarksfield - a key metaphor for a source of tensions in Clarksfield. These 'aliens' represented a new stranger presence in Clarksfield, potentially bringing others in Clarksfield together to welcome new people;
? inviting positive responses to the area as 'fuel' was collected;
? seeing the place of Clarksfield afresh through 'alien' eyes;
? changing the landscape as the aliens innocently placed themselves in it or 'decorated' it differently - thus refreshing it for residents;
? offering a focus - a spectacle - for families and neighbours to talk about and engage with;
? providing a source for arts and creative work within outreach workshops in schools and community halls.

Timeline:
The final EARTHED project (5 days intensive, 6th to 10th September, 2016) comprised:
? a range of workshops in two Clarksfield primary schools,
? post-school family and over 60s' workshops at a local church hall and elsewhere,
? a series of 'pop-up' street performance activities comprising walkabouts and community interactions all over Clarksfield,
? a finale in a small park at Clarksfield (a mini-festival to bid farewell to the alien characters).</gtr:description><gtr:id>C127E974-4B1E-4FD0-A901-6E8A683C7829</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It was estimated that around 1000 people were involved with EARTHED, approximately 20% of the Clarksfield population. (Researchers recognise there was repetition in some of the numbers below where engagement is suggested of over 1100 people.) Business Intelligence's evaluation of EARTHED focuses on the effect of the project. A number of research techniques were used by the evaluation team including observation of the week, surveys, evaluation forms, a post-project focus group (n10) and interviews with artists, core team and support team. A statistical evaluation of the impact of the project was di cult; capturing most people's views was
not possible in the midst of building a fictional narrative. Business Intelligence's evaluation takes account of all these research methods including the week-long observations by two researchers. An extract from the most statistic-based form of evaluation is included here.
An evaluation form was designed and distributed at the final event at Beckett Meadows once the final event had ended, electronically via the Oldham Council consultation portal as well as being shared wherever possible by groups involved in the various activities. What follows is a summary of the key findings from the evaluation (n41).
? 67% of respondents felt that the project had made them think more positively about the Clarksfield area.
? 92% of respondents indicated that they either loved or liked the project.
- 34% respondents stated that the project had brought them together with people of different ages.
? 29% respondents stated that the project had brought
them together with people of different ethnic backgrounds. Interestingly, this number was observed as much higher in the workshops and at the final event by the project team.
? 88% of respondents attended the final event with their children and/or friends
? 83% of respondents to the evaluation form indicated that they had stayed for longer than 30 minutes. Interestingly, no respondents stated that their attendance had been fluid, although this was clearly observed by researchers.
? 65% of respondents indicated that they had experienced the alien characters on one or more occasions.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>EARTHED an intensive week of workshops and residency in Clarksfield, Oldham</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://performingplaces.org/local.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The focus of Performing Local Places in Camden was to work with clients who lived in St Mungo's 24-hour supported accommodation. The project also worked with a number of clients from other St Mungo's residences in the area, where clients were living more independently and were supported by staff only during normal working hours.

Performing Local Places was to work specifically with clients living at St Mungo's Adamson Road supported living accommodation (comprising six flats, an office and communal space) to begin to think about 'moving on'. At the time of the intervention, there were 21 clients living at Adamson Road in five shared and one self-contained flat. Many of the clients had moved there after spending a period of time in hospital due to a mental health diagnosis. Clients living in the flats can access 24-hour support and are supported by key workers. Clients meet their key worker at monthly sessions and informally at least once a week. There are a number of group activities available that are run by St Mungo's staff and volunteers, including walking, gardening and peer support groups, art and dance therapy. 

17 Place sessions took place at Adamson Road and its surrounding streets and open spaces. Numbers of participants varied. One week, there was only one resident present, for example. There was a core group of four or five participants, and this remained fairly consistent from half- way through until the end of the project.

The initial plan was to work with clients from these residences over 17 weeks to create a body of performance-based work in the local area and beyond. Initial sessions consisted of 'making' activities where clients created simple improvised objects from tissue paper and similar materials, and placed them around the activities room where the project was taking place. Later sessions developed these 'making' activities, asking clients to create 'places' or 'scapes', often based around clients' positive memories. In the second half of the project, the focus shifted to getting clients outside to engage with the local area including leaving behind traces of the group's presence. These traces often consisted of trails made of ordinary everyday items such as flour, cake sprinkles, plastic daisies and paper tags with messages handwritten by clients. Other external activities included tying imitation autumn leaves in a nearby tree-lined walkway, creating a small 'performance space' in a nearby church garden and building a temporary 'party' site on a triangle of pavement. These activities often took on elements of performance. In one session, for example, the group re-created one client's positive memory of a tea party with scones through an improvisational activity where everyone took on a character. Facilitators helped clients think about the significance of these outings into the local area through reflection sessions before and after. All clients have experienced mental illness and some may have experienced homelessness; some having also experienced abuse. Many clients have experienced having very little control over where they live or for how long. Clients may have negative associations with the area around Adamson Road because of the circumstances that led them to living there. Practices that intentionally involve working with small and ordinary physical features of a location, such as brick walls or plants to create experiences that may be positively memorable, may be particularly well-suited to helping clients come to terms with their current environment. Within sessions, facilitators and clients worked together on a number of activities. These were not discrete activities, but worked in reciprocal, non-linear ways, with ideas and images arising in one activity, inspiring the content of later activities and always focused on 'place'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9C5DA55E-83E5-4B44-AD3D-536995A1232F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was evidence that some clients felt that the project had helped them in this form of 'moving on'.
I think I tried to feel more settled here but things haven't changed for me really since [names significant negative event]. I'm trying not to dwell on feelings about [signi cant negative event]. A lot of my time is taken up by things like that when I'm not in the [Performing Place] group so it's another reason why I like to be involved in the groups, which is kind of moving on. [. . .] So yes, I've sort of moved on. I've accepted that I live here now. I've accepted that . . . [Client 01]

This sense of 'moving on' as a form of personal development was also felt by participants who had very recently moved out into independent living.
Well, for me, it means, like, where I'm at the moment with my new at I'm thinking about what I can do to decorate the place, make it look like mine, you know? So I have quite a good selection of ideas, and I think what it's done is take, like, not a stagnant brain literally, but, like, a stagnant imagination and it's brought it back to life. Because I was always very creative but I, sort of, got out of the habit of it, so now I'm, you know, being creative again. So that's my moving on, is going back to my roots and, you know, getting all my art stu out again and doing all of that kind of stuff, yes. (Client 02)

Outcomes observed included changes in the way clients feel about being resident at St Mungo's; acceptance of situation, improved sense of wellbeing and a new sense of having
a place within local community (like being able to give back). There was a new sense of connectedness among the clients who took part. They became physically more comfortable with each other, and felt more able to support each other.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>PLACE practices with adults with mental illness in Camden</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://performingplaces.org/local.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Camden Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Camden Council - working with St Mungo's Housing Association employed by Camden Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>29F4502D-9737-4FF8-B200-AB11935151FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>St Mungo's has funded 12 more sessions under Finding Your Place, beginning January 2017, in response to the residents appeal for the sessions to be continued.

The initial project aim of helping residents think about physically 'moving on' from 24-hour supported accommodation to more independent forms of supported living proved to be too ambitious for the particular set of residents who were most engaged with the project. Interviews with staff and residents from St Mungo's, however, revealed different understandings of what 'moving on' could mean, including residents coming to accept some aspects of what has happened to them, thus providing the platform from which some residents may be able to build a meaningful life.

It took principles and practices from earlier award-winning work (Challenging Place) and invited councils to identify cross-cutting priorities that might benefit from such practices. Performing place practices were thus rolled out into new contexts and with new variations of practice.

Findings from each of the evaluation reports suggest that the two projects in Performing Local Places succeeded in their aims. 
Participants increased their attachment to place and concomitant benefits accrued. Each project was limited and each evaluation indicates that further work would be of additional benefit to the participants. (This has already been put in place in Camden. Further sessions with the residents were funded by St Mungo's.)

Performing place as a cultural practice was disseminated through two symposia; Greater London and Greater Manchester council staff with strategic and commissioning authority were invited. To increase understanding of the value of the work, the Performing Local Places report has been sent to all local authorities in the UK.

Arising from Performing Local Places as a whole project, overall recommendations are that:
&amp;gt; Place attachment is recognised as an important means to wellbeing by all local authorities.
&amp;gt; Enhancing place attachment is assumed as able to meet mainstream council agendas.
&amp;gt; Performing place is understood as an innovative and lateral arts practice that facilitates and achieves place attachment. This is in line with the opening quote in this document: 'innovative new schemes across the UK are paving the way to improved outcomes for people and communities, and better value for money for commissioners'. (Slay and Ellis-Petersen, 2016: 5).
&amp;gt; Experienced, highly creative, trained practitioners are employed for this work. Such practitioners will combine expert levels of performance-related facilitation for a wide range of participants with a air for unusual and lateral creative ideas. They will be able to inspire and attract others to work with them, whether local authority figures or specialist artists, and they will have been 'trained' in performing place practices.
&amp;gt; In planning projects, sufficient time and resources are allocated to the following:
- organisation and administration of projects;
- planning project ideas over a regular and continuous period of time with re ection periods to muse on ideas before implementing them;
- experimentation with new practices;
- outreach work of longevity, depth and rigour;
- enthusing, collaborating and discussing with relevant figures in councils and organisations who are supporting the work;
- inviting and promoting attendance by these figures at key moments;
- phasing Performing Place practices in certain contexts, allowing for reflection between stages of the work;
- documenting during the process and seeking permissions for use of images (as appropriate);
- debriefing;
- disseminating project work confidently;
- sharing and reflecting on affective moments.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1E2C618C-0739-4144-A988-92315DA0B2F9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In Oldham, Business Intelligence found that EARTHED created:
Positive forms of engagement
&amp;gt; It was clear that the mixture of outreach work conducted by the team including work in schools, with parents, local residents and community groups successfully enabled the project to engage with a wide range of Clarks eld residents.
&amp;gt; Response to the project has been positive from all involved, with participants increasingly owning the fictional narrative as the week progressed. Those involved in the workshops were seen to be actively participating in the activities.

Broad reach with repeated participant interest
&amp;gt; Researchers estimated that the various workshops and the final event attracted around 1000 individuals in total. A number of children attending the final event had also been present at school workshops. Based on these figures around one in five local residents played some part in the week's activities. Many more are likely to have heard about them from children, neighbours and others.

A clear catalyst for future engagement building good memories of place
&amp;gt; The event was welcomed by those involved. It was recognised by the project team and commissioner
that a one-week long series of events may not provoke long-term change but may act as a catalyst for future engagement within the Clarks eld community. It was 'an event' that attracted the community, and the memory of such an event was part of the project's intentions.

Increased feeling of being in place
&amp;gt; The nature of the week's events meant that the same faces became recognisable to members of the research team as the week wore on. Some of the changes in
the observed behaviours of these individuals such as increased coincidence and increased feeling of being in place are an indicator of the programme's success.

In London, McPin Foundation found that A Game of Trails:
Changed the meaning of 'moving on'
&amp;gt; The initial project aim of helping clients think about physically 'moving on' from 24-hour supported accommodation to more independent forms of supported living proved to be too ambitious for the particular set of clients who were most engaged with
the project. Interviews with staff and clients from St Mungo's, however, revealed different understandings of what 'moving on' could mean, including clients coming
to accept some aspects of what has happened to them, thus providing the platform from which some clients may be able to build a meaningful life.

Improved sense of wellbeing
&amp;gt; Clients reported several outcomes related to wellbeing, including improved mood and being more relaxed as a result of taking part in the sessions. Some clients also reported gaining confidence as a result of engaging with the project.

Created a new sense of connectedness among clients
&amp;gt; Participating in the project allowed clients to create relationships with others living in the house that they did not engage with previously. The core group of participants felt more con dent to talk to and support each other and spent time with each other outside of the project. Some clients attributed this development specifically to the nature of the arts activities.

Changed in the way clients feel about being resident at St Mungo's
&amp;gt; Taking part in the project made several of the clients feel more settled and more comfortable with living in
St Mungo's supported accommodation. For clients who had only been at St Mungo's a short time, it helped ease their transition from inpatient services to supported accommodation.

Created a new sense of having a place within local community
&amp;gt; Engaging with the project allowed clients to establish
a sense of place and feel more connected to the local community. Clients reported having built new positive associations with the local area and developed a feeling that they could have a place within the local community.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Recommendations from the Business Intelligence report on EARTHED suggest:
&amp;gt; It is clear that the project has acted as a catalyst to open doors to discussion and opportunities for future work in the Clarksfield area. It is recommended that Oldham Council build on the success of the project in this neighbourhood.
&amp;gt; Arts projects built into whole communities, working to council priorities, is a transferable concept. An upcoming symposium to advocate this work, together with a project in Camden, London, to a wider audience of council staff from the Greater Manchester area, is already in place. 
&amp;gt; Further dissemination is recommended. Engaging 20% of an entire community is exceptional.
&amp;gt; Harnessing the creative talent and enthusiasm of the project team for further such projects in and around Oldham is highly recommended.
&amp;gt; Statistically evaluating the impact of such arts work on the direct community is problematic. Additional methods are worth considering for the future.
&amp;gt; Working with a community to assess the impact of change through an arts event benefits from having prior knowledge of the residents' perceptions,
&amp;gt; Arts teams planning projects are advantaged by having a clear understanding of an area. Ideally, the statistics and information above would be known prior to a project.
&amp;gt; Flair in the original creative thinking behind the project was vital to its innovative approach and success.
&amp;gt; Outreach work was critical. Ample time to develop access to local connectors is needed.
&amp;gt; The high quality of the project work on offer was important for its success. Participants bought into the narrative and accepted it.
&amp;gt; Having unusual, spontaneous performance activities (i.e. the Aliens' walkabouts or pop-up theatre) together with planned workshops provided a rounded interrelated event that spread across the area in different ways, and engaged a large amount of Clarksfield residents.
&amp;gt; The trajectory towards a final event as a highlight of the week was important to build excitement, allow closure of the project and o er a heightened focus.

Recommendations from the McPin Foundation report on A Game of Trails suggest:
&amp;gt; Where colleagues share a history of practice (in this instance, in performing place practices), it is easier to take on challenging new environments.
&amp;gt; Outreach work was essential to encourage participation.
&amp;gt; A strongly supportive manager from St Mungo's was critical to the success of planning the project.
&amp;gt; Tenacity, commitment, collaboration and a sharing of processes and thoughts amongst the Performing Local Places team was important for maintaining a positive approach.
&amp;gt; The high quality of the project work on o er was important for its success including the ability to adapt and build from participants' ideas in lateral and unusual ways.
&amp;gt; Ambitious goals are not always achievable; recognising when these need to be shifted is essential.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>16B72DE5-67F8-43EA-B674-EACD1234C9CB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.performingplaces.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N007816/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA5B898B-8204-4E59-97AB-DA2B10124EED</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; Theatre - Other</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB55E3F-FFEA-4BE8-9850-37FB373F4D31</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
