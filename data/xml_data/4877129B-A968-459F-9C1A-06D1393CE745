disorders</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J020893/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Evidence collected from eyewitnesses is crucial for the success of a criminal investigation. Information from witnesses governs the initial direction of an investigation (providing lines of enquiry and identifying possible suspects), and the strength of evidence has been associated with guilty suspects confessing to their crimes. However, little is known about the capabilities of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) when providing witness information. Given their vulnerabilities in terms of cognitive, social and emotional difficulties, these children are at high risk of victimisation, violence and abuse. Therefore, fair and appropriate access to justice for children with ASD is an issue of paramount importance. 

The population of children and adults with ASD is very large, with prevalence rates of approximately one in 100 (Baird et al., 2006). We already know that individuals with ASD display a characteristic pattern of memory difficulties (e.g., having trouble recalling personally experienced events and recognising faces) and social communication impairments (e.g., lack of eye contact and problems with holding conversations) that call into question their abilities as criminal witnesses. Yet the few studies that have been conducted on this topic have shown that, although individuals with ASD recall less information about a witnessed event than typical groups, the information that they do provide can be just as accurate. 

Even less is known about the strengths and weaknesses of individuals with ASD across all the different stages of a criminal investigation. During the proposed research, several novel questions will be addressed: How does this group fare throughout the investigative process (e.g., during initial questioning, in an investigative interview, when identifying perpetrators, and during cross-examination)? What can be done to improve the amount of information that children with ASD recall, without a subsequent decrease in the accuracy of this information? How do the general public (who may be evaluating the evidence of individuals with ASD within a jury) perceive witnesses with ASD? And what factors (e.g., mood state, anxiety, suggestibility, basic memory abilities) are associated with the performance of children with ASD in a witness context? 

This research will represent the first in depth investigation of witness characteristics in children with ASD and will fill an important gap in our knowledge of this disorder. The work will address the need for basic theoretical research to increase our understanding of the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of children with ASD, but it will also provide answers to an important and pressing real-world issue - how do we ensure that children with ASD obtain fair and appropriate access to justice? The project has been designed to impact directly on policy by providing a basis for the development of guidelines and interventions to improve the performance of children with ASD in the Criminal Justice System (in collaboration with the National Autistic Society, UK).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will bring together theory and practice concerning access to justice for children with ASD, whilst at all times adopting an approach of high-level user engagement. 

ASD affects 1 in 100 individuals (Baird, et al., 2006) and has an estimated cost to the UK economy of over 28 billion pounds a year (Knapp, Romeo, &amp;amp; Beecham, 2009). Research aimed at reducing the difficulties experienced by this group is therefore a major public policy issue and could have a significant impact on reducing the economic burden of the disorder. 

The findings of the proposed research will be disseminated to a wide audience, including academics and researchers, criminal justice professionals (e.g., police officers, barristers, intermediaries), clinicians, and parents/carers of children with ASD. This will be achieved through a range of activities, including the publication of academic and non-academic research papers, presenting the work at academic and practitioner/user conferences, and hosting seminars for academics and practitioners/users. Of particular note, we will collaborate with the National Autistic Society to develop evidence-based guidelines on 'Access to justice in children with ASD' for criminal justice professionals. These important guidelines will be widely advertised (e.g., by disseminating the guidelines to professional organisations, and hosting the recommendations on the National Autistic Society website). We will actively seek input, advice and guidance on the findings of the project (as well as the associated guidelines and resources that we seek to produce) from relevant user groups. Adopting a dialectic approach, we aim to incorporate feedback and advice concerning aspects of the project into our non-academic and academic outputs. We envisage the results and guidelines will be widely cited within professional practice, as well as being of interest to academics conducting further work in this area. 

An important sustainable resource to be developed from this project will be a website dedicated to access to justice in children with ASD. This will host information for user groups and academics, and will include a range of resources developed as part of the project (e.g., best practice guidelines for witnesses with ASD, information on memory for events in ASD, publications arising from the project). Details about the project and associated outcomes will also be presented on the website of the National Autistic Society and other ASD websites, to reach a larger, more targeted audience.

We envisage that there will be significant media interest in this research, given recent high profile cases of individuals with ASD in legal settings (e.g., Gary McKinnon). We will therefore work with ESRC to prepare press releases concerning relevant aspects of the research that showcase the key findings and their impact on society. 

This work will also have an impact on future research on access to justice, by providing a framework by which to explore this topic in individuals with intellectual disabilities and/or other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Down syndrome). 

In summary, our impact work will involve a wide range of activities that will be relevant to a range of academic and non-academic groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>294083</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Metropolitan Police Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the Metropolitan Police</gtr:description><gtr:id>70046090-4FBC-4875-B905-C75B7EA57300</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A draft publication on juror perceptions of child witnesses. 

Two large-scale awareness raising impact events on autism and policing - these events were specifically designed for police officers in order to raise awareness about: autism; how to interview those with autism; and how to use Registered Intermediaries to assist with investigations. Immediately following the second event, one attending delegate was nominated as the Islington Police lead on autism. 

The new National Autistic Society guidelines on autism and policing (forthcoming).</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners in the Metropolitan Police Service organised for three members of our research team to attend Investigative Interviewing training at a police training centre in 2013. They also created the identification line-ups used in the research. Further, a Superintendent worked directly with us on one of our juror perception studies. 

Our partners at the Metropolitan Police helped us design and run two large-scale awareness raising impact events on autism and policing. They also undertook the advertising and registration process for these events and ensured that the widest possible range of officers from different commands were in attendance (total number of officers attending across the two events was about 250). 

One of our key impact outcomes was to help revise the existing National Autistic Society guide ('Autism: a guide for criminal justice professionals'). We did this in collaboration with our partners at the Metropolitan Police Service, co-writing the new guide with the National Autistic Society ('Autism: a guide for police officers). Our colleagues at the Met highlighted what worked well for them in the previous guide and what required improvement. They also commented on drafts of the final document and will liaise with us shortly to ensure the widest possible dissemination of the final version of the guide within the Metropolitan Police Service. This guide is due for publication later in 2017.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Recognising the significance of our research findings for police practice, we contacted the Head of Investigative Training at the Metropolitan Police Service to jointly deliver two separate awareness raising impact events designed specifically for police officers (for the Met and five other national police forces). These events were focused on raising awareness about autism as a disorder, how to interview individuals with autism, and the role that Registered Intermediaries can play in assisting with police interviews and other phases of a criminal investigation. Experts on autism, police officers with specialist knowledge of how to interview witnesses/suspects with autism, and a team of experienced, practicing Registered Intermediaries gave lectures and workshops to large audiences of police officers. We also invited our contacts from this department to work with us to develop new National Autistic Society guidelines for interviewing individuals with autism ('Autism: a guide for police officers').</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London (UCL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Academic collaboration - University College London</gtr:description><gtr:id>FDB901A2-59F1-42E6-857C-F6575DE2CD76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A publication is being prepared and will follow in 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Setting up of a new, linked research project on autism and family law, utilising our expertise from our research on autism and criminal law.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Dr Crane has worked with colleagues at UCL (in the Faculty of Laws and Centre for Research in Autism and Education) to set up and run a preliminary project exploring experiences of autism and family law.

That event was so successful and oversubscribed that we decided to run the event again, with some minor modifications, and the current entry reports on this second impact event. [The first event had covered three key areas related to autism and policing and the content for this second event remained unchanged: (1) raising awareness of autism as a disorder and how to identify those who may have autism; (2) how to interview witnesses/suspects with autism; and (3) how to use Registered Intermediaries to help with police interviews - using tailored communication aids and strategies.] The key modifications for this second impact event were: (1) to broaden the reach of the original event to forces beyond the Metropolitan Police (Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey, West Midlands, Staffordshire); (2) to focus on 'trainers' within each of these police forces to enable broader dissemination the information; and (3) to increase the length of the event from a half-day to one full day. 

120 delegates (uniform and CID) with ranks from Constable to Superintendent attended, including the Staff Officer to one of the Assistant Commissioners in the Met. There were representatives from many commands including counter-terrorism, murder, sexual offenses, organised crime, Trident, and the Directorate of Professional Standards. We received excellent feedback from delegates that the event had raised awareness, confidence and knowledge in all key areas, and that the experts who spoke at the event were knowledgeable, approachable and informative. The research team made many contacts with police officers, and facilitated dialogue between Registered Intermediaries and police officers. One police officer reported that, immediately following this event, he was nominated as the Islington Police lead on autism.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Metropolitan Police Awareness Raising Event 'Autism and Policing'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07F4CB2F-7060-4F09-A72C-3B89DF41BE6A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This 'Autism and Policing' impact event was a large-scale half-day series of lectures and seminars designed for police officers, organised jointly by our research team and the Metropolitan Police Service.

Our findings. In the first empirical investigation of its kind, 6- to 11-year-old children (71 with autism, 201 who were typically developing, all with IQs over 69) viewed a staged event and subsequently took part in all the different stages of a criminal investigation: interviews; identification line-ups; and cross-examination. For typical children, support from an RI (compared to best-practice police interviews) nearly doubled the amount of information recalled about the event (without increasing errors). RI support also improved children's ability to identify the 'perpetrators' during video line-ups, and to resist challenges during cross-examination. For children with autism, the beneficial effects of RI support were not observed. However, encouragingly, the performance of children with autism was equivalent to typical children (i.e., no better or worse) when both groups were assessed with alternative interview techniques (best-practice police interviews, interviews with additional verbal prompts, interviews using a drawing technique to support recall). Further, when neither group was aided by an RI, children with autism did not make more errors than typical children at interview, were just as good at identifying 'perpetrators' in the line-ups, and were as resistant to cross-examination challenges (although all children were very vulnerable at cross-examination). These findings suggested that child witnesses with autism can be as reliable as typical children. 

We also determined, from a range of standardised cognitive assessments (attention, memory, language, IQ), the best predictors of interview performance. For both typical children and those with autism, age, memory ability, and to a lesser extent language ability, were related to the amount recalled at interview. 

In three further studies, mock jurors (260 jury eligible adults in total) rated the credibility of selected children's interviews/cross examinations. The presence of an RI did not affect credibility ratings for typical children; we additionally found that information given to juries about children with autism should be tailored specifically to the individual witness (i.e., providing generic information about autism was less helpful). 

Novel approaches. For cross-examination, a novel approach was developed arising from a new collaboration with an experienced barrister. Previous research used scripted questions (usually presented by research assistants) whereas we: (1) used qualified, experienced barristers; (2) developed a 'defence statement' protocol from which barristers cross-examined the children in a more realistic manner; and (3) used video conferencing facilities to replicate the 'live link' used in courtrooms. 

New directions. We were unable to test the full role that RIs play, as we focused on the preparation/implementation of the investigative interview, identification line-up and cross-examination. In actual criminal investigations, the RI role is wider and encompasses many issues, including whether a child can give evidence at all, particularly in traumatic circumstances. Further work should systematically evaluate other aspects of the RI role for child witnesses with autism, providing a more holistic assessment of their efficacy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academics can pursue whether other aspects of the registered intermediary role may help children with autism and typical children to perform better in interviews, identification line-ups and cross-examinations. 

Police officers, barristers, judges and registered intermediaries can take forward the message that registered intermediaries are extremely beneficial for typical children across all stages of the criminal justice process: in interviews, identification line-ups and cross-examinations. This is particularly important as there has been some resistance to the use of Registered Intermediaries for typical children. A further message for these professionals is that children with autism (with IQs over 69) can cope with the cognitive aspects of criminal justice procedures, but that age, memory and language abilities are important factors to keep in mind when assessing suitability. Whilst registered intermediaries may not have had a beneficial effect on the volume or accuracy of the material recalled by children with autism, they are still likely to be needed for these children, so that they can cope with giving evidence successfully in formal and unfamiliar police or court contexts, which most children with autism find highly anxiety-provoking.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AA43F53D-DD65-488C-B020-AC2DEC2AE8A9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.childwitnesses.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The Advocate's Gateway Toolkit 15 'Witnesses and defendants with autism: Memory and sensory issues'</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DF65313-20C8-4BF1-B7B8-37E2A6CB9A0D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our research team were invited to develop a working group and subsequently write a new toolkit for The Advocate's Gateway website on 'Witnesses and defendants with autism: memory and sensory issues' (Toolkit 15).
