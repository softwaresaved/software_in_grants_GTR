Where appropriate, we will work in collaboration with other relevant organisations that share a mutual interest in these urban issues.

The ESRC is therefore delighted to invite Expressions of Interest for a collaborative Knowledge Exchange Fellowship in partnership with the Foresight Future of Cities project.

The aim of this Fellowship is to work on behalf of the ESRC Urban Transformations portfolio to synthesise evidence, promote opportunities for research impacts and support various knowledge exchange activities. This will include identifying opportunities to enhance the links between the Foresight Future of Cities project, the wider network of cities' stakeholders and the urban academic research community. The fellow will be expected to work closely with the ESRC Urban Transformations Coordinator and Foresight Future of Cities Project Team.

Urban Transformations and Foresight Future of Cities Knowledge Exchange Research Fellow
The fellowship exists in order to exert influence over the ways in which urban scholarship influences practice. 
As such the scheme as conceived is about brokerage across numerous pathways to impact. 
A key issue on this front is the scale of the challenge of influencing perceptions from &amp;quot;both sides of the wall&amp;quot; of the academy about the usefulness and useability of scholarly work. I have taken every Knowledge Exchange opportunity available and am positioned at the leading edge of impactful policy-relevant urban research, presenting last year at the UK Knowledge Mobilisation Forum at NESTA. For social scientific impact to be meaningful we must move beyond &amp;quot;bolted on&amp;quot; &amp;quot;afterthought&amp;quot; type dissemination activities and be far more responsive to forms of collaboration in the whole life cycle of research activities, from ideas through to agreeing scholarly outputs. I have been very fortunate that the ESRC has consistently supported my KE activities. My PhD was an ESRC-sponsored CASE award with the Centre for Local Economic Strategies (CLES) I was awarded a Technology Strategy Board (TSB) post-doctoral research fellowship with the same think-tank. An ESRC scheme led me to an internship in 2008 within the Parliament and Constitution Centre (PCC) in the Parliament library in 2008. I have spoken about the role of the ESRC in KE across the research life career on various platforms. The research council is only one voice amongst an increasingly crowded space where many think-tanks and intermediary bodies have things to say about cities but one which can mobilise the collective talents of myriad scholars. Often more rigorous work lacks the media coverage of polished 'wonkcomms' irrespective of content and this is something I have discussed with research colleagues from within the urban scholarship community which has sometimes lacked a coherent voice within policy debates.

Opportune timing, welcome focus, scaling up of &amp;quot;best practices&amp;quot; from UT &amp;amp; FoC

The greatest opportunity of the fellowship is the propitious timing of the project. It is at this stage in the REF 2020 cycle that there is the highest potential for genuine behaviour change with the ways in which academics frame their urban research questions and the ways in which this can meaningfully scale up policy and practical application. The assembling under the umbrella of the UT portfolio contains a great generational mix whereby earlier career/future leaders type scholars can genuinely carve out space for a career predicated on meaningful impactful work. Further a serious focus on cities by the research council, and the potential for achieving the synergies across urban transformations and future of cities may create a genuine platform for working in quite a radically different way on societal challenge with those in positions of authority. Our work at the Heseltine Institute has been to seek to advance this way of working at the local level but the opportunity of the fellowship is to scale up successful practice. I am very well connected with those in the UK grappling with these issues within universities. I have been integrally involved in thinking about the ways in which universities as anchor institutions need to work differently across policy and practice boundaries. There is a great appetite for change.
