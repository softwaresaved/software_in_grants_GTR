Less well understood are the ways andmeans by which to do so. This one-year project explores the potential for, and value of, design-led research to addresssocietal challenges and to inform policy. It does this through establishing a 'Public Collaboration Lab' (PCL), a strategicresearch collaboration between local government (London Borough of Camden), the citizens they serve, and an HigherEducation institution (University of the Arts London).

The project will use social innovation approaches to engage citizens and other societal actors in the co-design and co-delivery of some aspects of public services. These 'public and collaborative' approaches to service delivery (servicesdelivered with and by citizens and other agencies) seek to mobilise citizens as 'active collaborative people' rather than'passive individual people', 'service participants' rather than 'service users' and recognise citizens as both 'people withneeds' and 'people as assets in meeting their own and each other's needs'. However, despite the growing interest in therole, objectives and impact of design in strategic public sector contexts, there is also an acknowledged gap inunderstanding design's contribution to such situations. This project is designed to address that gap.

Two interrelated action research activities will be delivered in parallel. The first will deliver a citizen-centred exploration ofexactly how such collaboration plays out in specific service contexts. For the pilot we propose to take the reform of LondonBorough of Camden's Library Services as our starting point. The second will explore the models, mechanisms andmeasurement of impact of the 'Public Collaboration Lab', evaluating the model and its wider potential as a means ofdemocratizing social and service innovation and informing policy.

The project aims to: 
- Undertake a demonstrator social innovation project within a specially created 'public collaboration lab' to redesign publicservices through the application of collaborative design led approaches.
- Increase understanding of HEI institutions' roles in supporting innovation practices within local government throughdesign led action research. 
- Explore the potential for co-design to democratize public service reform and improve pubic outcomes. 
- Co-design evaluative frameworks for assessing the role of design in local government service reform.
- Propose means by which the pilot study could be upscaled within other contexts

A process of examination and distillation will create a body of material which will serve as the basis for a series ofcoordinated outputs, including journal articles, conference papers, a research blog, case study material, service and socialinnovations, as well as a public collaboration lab model, framework and tools for HE/LG collaboration. The PCL team willwork closely with Nesta, Public Service Transformation Network, the international DESIS Network of over 40 DESIS labs,Impact Hub Network, Social Innovation Exchange, King's Cross Knowledge Quarter, Age UK and others to disseminateand maximise real-world impact of the project outputs. Dissemination will be integrated within the collaborativemethodology of the project, by involving relevant users, practitioners and policy makers in research, ideation andimplementation. To disseminate the findings, the project team will target major events and publications in the localgovernment, public policy, design research, and design HE communities. The final evaluation report will be designed in aforward-looking manner so that the lessons and opportunities arising from this pilot can be applied in other contexts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>384507</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Short video (filmed and edited by Lucy Jones), describing Future Libraries project.

These include: Stitch Map' by Soizic Porhel and Marina Mellado, 'Library Bureau' by Andrea Nicholas De Montis, 'Library Expedition' by Bronka de Sage, 'Library Alchemy' by Joao Gil and 'Library Sticker Chart'by Lin Chen.

Stitch Map is a thread map that creates a heat map. It allows us to analyse different user typologies, gathering information about the services, activities and spaces that visitors use in the library. The board creates a network heat map which highlights the most popular points, hence the tool makes the user write and reflect on which services they would preserve, create or ignore in the Future Library.

Library Bureau toolkit is a board game for public engagement which intends to involve non-libraries users to create their ideal future libary - library floorplan, space specifications, facilities, activities inside and the potential users of their library.

Library Expedition is a map which guides participants through &amp;quot;an adventure&amp;quot; rather than questionnaire and hence the participants are able to express their emotional connection to the library values in an unprompted way as well as to provide individual understanding of those values.

Library Alchemy is a research tool developed around the metaphor of a cabinet of curiosity. It is shaped like a trolley due to its itinerant nature.
The metaphor worked as a form of detachment from the prejudices of what a library means, and its ambiguous nature to leave openness to create an emotional relationship, unprescribing answers, and allowing a conversation to be expressed throughout the tool.

Library Sticker Chart contains a series of stickers which visualize the library services that people use to value present and future services in different libraries.</gtr:description><gtr:id>831A761B-E160-4B5D-896C-6A57D3E31D9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Specialist academic and practitioner audience (circa 200 attending the Restless Futures conference) provided feedback on the consultation tools. The tools were recognised as making a tangible contribution to the discussion of 'democratising innovation' in that they demonstrated a novel way of bringing new publics into dialogue and decision making around the future scenarios for public services - in this case public libraries. A notable impact is commissioning of an engagement tool designed by the team for the King's Cross Knowledge Quarter (http://www.knowledgequarter.london) - to be used to help them map the community engagement activities of their members.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Future Libraries project - Interactive exhibition at Restless Futures conference</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.arts.ac.uk/csm/whats-on-at-csm/restless-futures/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Public Collaboration Lab exhibition was updated with new research outputs and exhibited at the 14th Participatory Design Conference, Aarhus University, Denmark between 15th and 19th August 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7FA23C05-E285-4DC8-8901-59B633A99998</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition reached an audience of approximately 150, mainly design academics and practitioners.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Public Collaboration Lab exhibition</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://pdc2016.org</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Following its launch at Central Saint Martins, the Public Collaboration Lab (PCL) exhibition was updated and displayed at Camden Council offices at 5 Pancras Square (24th February 2016 - 11th March 2016).

? Workshop at the Ideas Lab in a neighbouring London borough with elderly users.
? Workshop at Age UK with non-HLS users - a co-design session was held at an Age UK coffee morning where the main findings were presented. The students then separated and showed individual concepts to different groups of elderly people. 

The exploration of possible service opportunities through technology, volunteers and as a form of Adult Social Care through a workshop with council officers from different departments and HLS team members meant that one of the project outcomes was that these service opportunities were fed into a consultation document on the future of the HLS and delivered to the Cabinet Office in October 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Camden Council's HLS team provided time to support students in their ethnographic work.

The Strategy and Change team members offered their time to understand the challenges facing current services, provided support with information and initiated meetings between key council officers and the students undertaking the research. They also gave their time to feedback on ideas and developments as the project progressed. Age UK offered space for co-design workshops, access to users and key members within the community. Age UK staff also attended presentations and provided input at workshops on issues facing the elderly within the community. North London Cares provided assistance to the students to inform the study, again through access to key staff and service users.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Home Library Service (HLS) project, led by Dr Alison Prendiville, was coordinated by the Public Collaboration Lab (PCL) research team and paired seven MDes Service Design Innovation students from London College of Communication with HLS front line officers. The aim of the project was to explore the future of Camden's HLS through Service Design thinking methods and tools as part of a collaborative project.

The students co-designed how the HLS may be reconfigured in the future through new relationships and technology, exploring opportunities for the service to be utilised to address other societal problems such as loneliness and related social care issues. Extensive prototyping and co-design methods were used to drive the project forward.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London Borough of Camden</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Reimagining Planning project</gtr:description><gtr:id>FAF4F48C-55DC-4C1D-865A-F4A8C3756616</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs of this collaborative project include:
? A series of insights around diverse perspectives on engagement with the planning system.
? A set of 'planning personas' to help inform/structure future planning engagement activities.
? A set of proposals and prototypes for tools, methods and strategies for engaging a more diverse range of people within the planning process.

Outcomes for different partners are listed below.

Outcomes for UCL undergraduates:
? Made tangible the abstraction of design thinking and gave insight into and experience of design methods and tools.
? Through the project students developed their own understanding and expertise about the planning process and decision making.

Outcomes for Camden Council Planning and Development Management team:
? Articulation of insights and ideas around re-imagining the planning process.
? Realisation of some of the reasons for lack of engagement of certain publics.
? Re-emphasis of issues and challenges already known to the members of the team led to reflection and renewed intentions to 'act to resolve or address the issues raised'.

Outcomes for Camden Council Strategy and Change team:
? A cost neutral opportunity to greatly explore and extend the issue of planning engagement.
? Learning from the project can be applied to a wide array of consultations and will be shared with engagement colleges.

Outcomes for residents, users of the system, small businesses:
? Some residents reported an increased ability and preparedness to participate in planning because they have more confidence to do so.

Outcomes for expert participants (architects, consultants and activists):
? Enabled experts to contribute to the process of reflection around the strengths and weaknesses and barriers and opportunities of the planning process based on their deep local knowledge of the planning system as users and campaigners. Enabled them to engage with Camden Council's Planning team in a different way.

Outcomes for UAL/PCL:
? Demonstrated that the process of learning through design and design methods can be grasped by non-designers. It showed that design methods can be learned and applied by a group of very young non-experienced non-designers in not much time (a sprint) with expert support / facilitation. i.e. it supports the argument that experiential learning works to develop design capacity at the same time as delivering useful insights into the design context.
? Demonstrated how a design process can foster comfort amongst a diverse disciplinary group working with uncertainty.
? Learned about the capacity of our collaborative infrastructure (cross agency/cross disciplinary team and ways of working) to be responsive to opportunity and context.
? Understanding of an articulated design process as a 'boundary object' (Star, 1989) in the context of collaboration between and across disciplines and agencies. Consideration of the project itself as a boundary object, allowing both heterogeneity and cooperation in relation to critiques of the planning process.
? Demonstrated scalability for the insights gained from the Future Libraries project i.e. If creative consultation/engagement can work within the complexity of the planning process then it can be useful in most instances of local government engagement and consultation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Camden Council Strategy and Change team: Co-designing and coordinating the project, including enrolment and coordination of community researchers and workshop attendees.

The project focused on a 4 week collaborative student project involving University College London (UCL) BSc Management Science and University of the Arts London (UAL) design students. The project was delivered in partnership with Camden Council and the PCL. It was led by Dr Lucy Kimbell (UCL design module tutor and UAL academic) in close collaboration with Professor Adam Thorpe (PCL).

The project brought together students from diverse disciplines (Design and Management Science), users and non-users of Camden's planning system, and experts from different backgrounds (architects, planning consultants and planning officers) to collaborate to understand the planning system in the London Borough of Camden and the barriers to engagement with it as experienced by diverse publics. Also, to co-design and prototype ideas for better ways to engage people in processes of neighbourhood planning and development control in the borough.

The PCL research team collaborated with the Strategy and Change and Planning and Development departments at Camden Council, UCL (Dr. Lucy Kimbell) and different departments within UAL to co-design and coordinate the project and support the teaching of students and delivery of site visits, field research and collaborative workshops with Camden residents.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Veolia Environmental Services</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Let's Sort it Out! project</gtr:description><gtr:id>F67240FA-82A2-449E-B63F-5AD9B51DEB17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Tbc</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>London Borough of Camden Environmental Services and Housing teams supported the coordination and delivery of the project, Tenants and Residents Association (TRA) leads for the estates involved supported the community engagement and co-design workshop activity in the participating estates, hosted in the TRA halls.

Outcomes for UAL/PCL:
? Demonstrated that the process of learning through design and design methods can be grasped by non-designers. It showed that design methods can be learned and applied by a group of very young non-experienced non-designers in not much time (a sprint) with expert support / facilitation. i.e. it supports the argument that experiential learning works to develop design capacity at the same time as delivering useful insights into the design context.

In addition to participating in the activities described above, alongside Strategy and Change team colleagues, Camden Council Libraries and Registration Services staff worked with research staff to support the student designers in the iterative development of their creative consultation tools, participating in tutorials and testing activities. Also, in coordinating engagement with front line staff and citizens in and around Camden's libraries (via ad-hoc creative engagement activities and programmed public workshops).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In the Future Libraries project, led by Professor Adam Thorpe, Public Collaboration Lab (PCL) research staff and MA Industrial Design students at Central Saint Martins worked with Camden Council officers and front line staff to design creative interactions that engage library users and other citizens in talking about their concerns, needs and desires relating to future libraries.

Linked to Camden Council exploring opportunities for reshaping Camden's Library Services due to reduced funding from central government, the aim of the project was to deliver creative consultations to find out what Camden's citizens value about their libraries now, and what they hope for the libraries of the future.

Students and researchers contributed to Camden Council's public engagement and consultation around this issue by delivering the following:
? Project planning meetings with the Strategy and Change team and service leads to co-define and co-design the project activities.
? Scoping research in and around Camden's libraries to gain an understanding of the current situation in regards to citizen and staff activities, patterns of usage and perceptions.
? Workshops with library staff to check the research findings to date and get feedback on initial insights and establish the focus of further qualitative research into citizens' values in relation to the future of libraries. The focus of enquiry informed the briefs for the creative consultation tools and methods to be designed and implemented.
? Design development meetings with the Library Transition Manager and consultation lead. As the designers developed the designs for the creative consultation tools and methods they were iteratively tested and reviewed by Library Service staff and members of the public.
? 250 face-to-face consultations with members of the public in and around Camden's libraries. The final creative consultation tools were implemented in various locations in and around libraries throughout the London Borough of Camden.
? Future Library workshops (x 2) with members of the public (at Swiss Cottage and St Pancras libraries). The findings of the consultation informed the design of a workshop that every citizen who participated in the consultation activities was invited to. These workshops explored strategies for how the values of citizens might be combined and met within Camden's libraries in future, in the face of forthcoming reductions in public funding.
? A presentation of findings to council stakeholders. Findings were synthesised into a digital publication and short film summarising the project.
? Circulation of findings to council stakeholders. The digital publication and short film were circulated within the council.
?

Extensive prototyping and co-design methods were used to drive the project forward.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London Borough of Camden</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Future Libraries project</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C199C43-7F09-452D-8533-5FBA6F5B7A76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs of the project included:
? 5 x creative consultation tools ('Stitch Map' by Soizic Porhel and Marina Mellado, 'Library Bureau' by Andrea Nicholas De Montis, 'Library Expedition' by Bronka de Sage, 'Library Alchemy' by Joao Gil and 'Library Sticker Chart' by Lin Chen)
? A future library 'game' (workshop method and tools)
? Digital publication of the project and findings, circulated to Camden Council stakeholders
? Short film of the project and findings (10 minutes), circulated to Camden Council stakeholders.

Outcomes of the project include:
? Creative consultation findings have fed into council decision making processes via a report to the Cabinet Office.
? Creative consultation is understood to be a valuable addition to existing statutory consultation methods and tools within the London Borough of Camden.
? Creative consultation is being considered as an addition to existing statutory consultation methods and tools within other local authorities following dissemination workshops attended by other UK councils.

Furthermore, the Future Libraries project has prompted more enquiries for support with public engagement and consultation via collaboration with design education from within other departments of Camden Council (e.g. Integrated Youth Services, Planning, Building Control and Development Management).</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>In the Future Libraries project, Camden Council Strategy and Change staff worked with research staff to co-design the project and coordinate its delivery and the dissemination of findings. Strategy and Change staff also participated in evaluative interviews to help understand the impact of this way of working in collaboration with design HE.

Strategy and Change team collaborators coordinated and participated in:
? Planning meetings with research team and service leads.
? Workshop with library staff.
? Future Library workshops (x 2) with members of the public (at Swiss Cottage and St Pancras libraries).
? A presentation of findings to council stakeholders.
? Circulation of findings to council stakeholders.
? Dissemination of the creative consultation approach to council stakeholders via presentations at council stakeholder events

In addition to participating in the activities described above, alongside Strategy and Change team colleagues, Camden Council Libraries and Registration Services staff worked with research staff to support the student designers in the iterative development of their creative consultation tools, participating in tutorials and testing activities. Also, in coordinating engagement with front line staff and citizens in and around Camden's libraries (via ad-hoc creative engagement activities and programmed public workshops).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In the Future Libraries project, led by Professor Adam Thorpe, Public Collaboration Lab (PCL) research staff and MA Industrial Design students at Central Saint Martins worked with Camden Council officers and front line staff to design creative interactions that engage library users and other citizens in talking about their concerns, needs and desires relating to future libraries.

Linked to Camden Council exploring opportunities for reshaping Camden's Library Services due to reduced funding from central government, the aim of the project was to deliver creative consultations to find out what Camden's citizens value about their libraries now, and what they hope for the libraries of the future.

Students and researchers contributed to Camden Council's public engagement and consultation around this issue by delivering the following:
? Project planning meetings with the Strategy and Change team and service leads to co-define and co-design the project activities.
? Scoping research in and around Camden's libraries to gain an understanding of the current situation in regards to citizen and staff activities, patterns of usage and perceptions.
? Workshops with library staff to check the research findings to date and get feedback on initial insights and establish the focus of further qualitative research into citizens' values in relation to the future of libraries. The focus of enquiry informed the briefs for the creative consultation tools and methods to be designed and implemented.
? Design development meetings with the Library Transition Manager and consultation lead. As the designers developed the designs for the creative consultation tools and methods they were iteratively tested and reviewed by Library Service staff and members of the public.
? 250 face-to-face consultations with members of the public in and around Camden's libraries. The final creative consultation tools were implemented in various locations in and around libraries throughout the London Borough of Camden.
? Future Library workshops (x 2) with members of the public (at Swiss Cottage and St Pancras libraries). The findings of the consultation informed the design of a workshop that every citizen who participated in the consultation activities was invited to. These workshops explored strategies for how the values of citizens might be combined and met within Camden's libraries in future, in the face of forthcoming reductions in public funding.
? A presentation of findings to council stakeholders. Findings were synthesised into a digital publication and short film summarising the project.
? Circulation of findings to council stakeholders. The digital publication and short film were circulated within the council.
? Dissemination of the creative consultation approach to council stakeholders via presentations at council stakeholder events.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Future Library project  - Camden citizen engagements</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B7CE26E-C081-4D25-B042-BB6CC29F61AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public Collaboration Lab (PCL) staff and students delivered 250 creative consultation engagements with Camden citizens across 6 libraries in the London Borough of Camden between 4th - 11th June 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://publiccollaborationlab.wordpress.com/2016/02/10/future-libraries/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Overcrowded Living project - Camden Sharing event (x2)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ED82B2BA-19C6-4AC7-AF93-D4C2E3159B2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outcomes from the Overcrowded Living project were shared with stakeholders on 8th June 2016 and 11th October 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Driving Value and Business Innovation Through Collaboration Between Industry and Academia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEE450E1-B963-4BD3-8D40-BD5105016E5D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An all-Party Parliamentary event, Design and Innovation, was held on 24th November 2015 at the House of Commons.

There are two mainstream trends that are currently weakening communities-in-place: that of a hyper-individualised, delocalised society; and that of the notion of going back to the communities and places of the past.

This event presented examples of art and design contributions to processes of community building that can counter these trends and help enable conditions for the kind of encounters that evolve towards new social forms.
This seminar focused on collective reflection, and was an opportunity to discuss how in our current context, art and design is collaborating to (re)build communities-in-place.

As a networking event, the workshop sought to provide opportunities for collaboration. Follow up and facilitation was provided by the Public Collaboration Lab (PCL). It was an opportunity for local government to see the value of collaboration with higher education and vice versa.

It follows the fictional narrative of the board game's format -

&amp;quot;There has been a murder in the old library and the killer has burnt it down to hide the evidence. While the police are hunting the murderer, a detective from the Future Libraries Bureau is trying to reshape the future of the new library with input from the general public, ensuring the new library works for the users better than before.&amp;quot;

We are interested in the role of the Future Libraries creative engagement tools and their relationship to existing definitions such as 'things', 'boundary objects' and 'cultural probes'. The terminology to describe the application of different PD practices has come from many areas and is sometimes inconsistent (Sanders et al. 2010). 

We propose, through this mini-workshop, to take a moment to experience the tools and reflect on their role and the need for specificity in their definition. 

The workshop takes the form of two activities, which are starting points for a group discussion. The workshop participants are:

1. Invited to interact with the Public Collaboration Lab engagement tools displayed in the exhibition, reflecting on their functionality, characteristics, etc. 

2. Building on Sanders &amp;amp; Stappers work, map the tool on the revised Approaches to Making Framework (2014)

These activities will inform a wider roundtable discussion on the various definitions of these objects, identifying which are the most useful and/or relevant in the context of PD research. 

The results of the above activities and a summary of the roundtable discussions will be documented as part of the wider Public Collaboration Lab research project, disseminated at research events in London, UK in October and, more informally, on the Public Collaboration Lab research blog.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>PCL co-developed and co-delivered a prototype for a public and social innovation lab focused on service, social and policy innovation at the local level. The lab centred on a partnership between the Design for Social Innovation and Sustainability Lab at the University of the Arts London (UAL DESIS Lab) and Camden Council.

PCL shares characteristics that are common to other public social innovation labs:
&amp;middot; Project teams are typically multi-stakeholder and multi-disciplinary.
&amp;middot; Projects seek to understand the wider system whilst prioritising human experience.
&amp;middot; Collaboration and co-creation with end-users of services and stakeholders are central to the work of the lab.
&amp;middot; Approaches are iterative and agile following a robust design process framed as action research in 'real life' scenarios.

However, PCL is differentiated by its primary emphasis on collaboration between local government and design education. Local Government Officers (LGOs) and design students, supported by tutors and academic research staff, worked with residents and other stakeholders via participatory design activities including collaborative and creative exploration, visualising and visioning workshops delivered as part of an ongoing portfolio of projects undertaken by the lab. Project participants have included 50 design students, 338 Camden residents, 134 council officers from 9 local authorities, 18 academics from 7 HEIs, 4 elected members and 127 other people engaged as representatives of third and private sector organisations.

PCL located staff and students of design universities as societal assets capable of bringing design skills and competencies to bear on societal challenges, and the community context as an action-learning environment for all those involved. Participants shared knowledge, skills, experience and expertise working collaboratively to address local goals and challenges linked to the co-design and prototyping of public service and social innovations.

PCL projects have provided participants with an opportunity for experimentation and reflection that contributes to the open innovation of public services. The lab has introduced and integrated a design-led approach to the work of LGOs. Students, led by LGOs and experienced design research and teaching staff, deliver ethnographic design research developing and testing methods and tools for co-discovery and co-creation in the process. Projects addressed specific challenges and service areas such as; how to consult more meaningfully with citizens on public issues such as the future of libraries and the planning process; finding ways of increasing recycling rates; dealing with the effects of overcrowded housing; and reshaping youth centres to facilitate the integration of Youth Services. These activities provided greater capacity for local government to engage with residents and other stakeholders. The open and collaborative nature of the projects fostered the assembly of publics around the issues of concern/service areas addressed. The participatory design process engaged the diverse actors assembled in a process of making visible their experiences, concerns and desires in relation to the issues and services considered and identifying and prioritising challenges and opportunities for intervention. Also, in collectively visioning new ways of addressing these challenges and opportunities. The outputs of these activities include rich qualitative insights that have supported decision making and priority setting by LGOs and politicians in the London borough of Camden as well as affording insights to stakeholders further afield, national and internationally. Alternative possibilities for delivery of services and achievement of improved public outcomes have also been explored and proposed, feeding into service innovation and transformation in the service areas described. Depending on the nature of the projects they have involved residents in priority setting around service transformation, contributed to raise awareness and change behaviours to reduce costs to the public or redefined and redesigned ways of developing and delivering services to meet the requirements of reduced financial support from central government.
 
The impact and value of these activities at a local level, on local government and the citizens they serve, can be seen in these comments from officers involved in the projects at both strategic and operational levels within the organisation.
 
&amp;quot;PCL offers us the chance to explore new ways of collaborating with our partners and our communities, to design services that are based around the needs of residents. It is also allowing us to tap into the creativity and energy of Central Saint Martins staff and students, which is adding a completely fresh perspective to how we go about solving problems.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;The probes worked really well on yesterday's visit. We left quite late because it helped the mother to think of the positives for her, about home and community - she said that it made her realise that the best option for her family would be to stay and make the most of the space. Of course her ideal option would be to move to a 3 bed.
 
She also said that it felt as though you had all worked to personalise the tools which made her feel that we were there to help and understand and that even though she knew the underlying message was that she was unlikely to get a move quickly, she felt that the project was a positive move. She got quite emotional. But it was nice that the probes had helped her to think about her space differently. This will probably help with Homeswapper as it will lead to more positive adverts as she does have a lot to offer. She was very impressed with the skills swap - she was sure it would help bond the community.&amp;quot;

At a national level the project is anticipated to impact in similar ways across the country as we plan to disseminate the collaborative model and methodology to other local authorities and design HEIs. To do this we plan to work with our evaluation partners the Institute for Local Government (INLOGOV) and their contacts across the public sector including the Society of Local Government Chief Executives (SOLACE) who have expressed interest in the model. Also, our advisors, Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) who have a membership of over 200 local authorities are keen to collaborate in dissemination of the learning from the project to their membership.

Internationally, as a result of the research delivered, the PCL has partnered in an EU consortium that has applied to the 'H2020 Application of co-creation in public services' call with the intention of sharing our insights around the model of the PCL with EU partners at a city, regional and national level.

In these ways the PCL research hopes to scale up positive impact locally and scale out positive impact via dissemination nationally and internationally in the coming years.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2BB6A576-E116-4BC7-8BDE-8681E9F15F26</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Public Collaboration Lab (PCL) project has delivered a portfolio of research activity resulting in the following developments and discoveries:
1. Literature review around the intersection of research and practice that informs the work of public social innovation labs at a local government scale. These include the fields of collaborative and participatory design, experiential learning, systems thinking and existing approaches to public innovation labs. This research brings this information together for the first time to inform the theoretical underpinning of local government/design education collaboration in public service and social innovation.
2. National (UK) survey of local government/design education collaboration. This online survey mapped the UK landscape for local government/design education collaboration resulting in insights relating to the number, scale and scope of collaborations of this kind. Also, the creation and documentation of data according to typologies of thematic focus, operational mechanism, funding mechanism, motivation, methodologies and stakeholder involvement in collaborations of this nature.
3. National (UK) and international interviews with stakeholders in local government and design education involved in local government/design education collaboration. These interviews have been transcribed and coded to inform the development an 'anatomy of design education/local government collaboration', detailing for academic and local government audiences insights relating to; Who (stakeholder involvement), What (collaborative mechanism), Why (motivations, objectives and thematic focus), Where (organisational sites of activity across the participating institutions) and How (operational and methodological considerations) local government/design education take place, reflecting on existing practices and learning and delivering recommendations and insights for practitioners in these fields.
4. A prototype for collaboration between a design Higher Education Institution (University of the Arts London) and a local government authority (Camden Council) that has delivered a series of collaborative design experiments that engage local government officers, design students, educators and researchers and residents and other stakeholders (private and third sector organisations) in the co-development and co-delivery of participatory design-led projects exploring the synergy between the learning objectives of design education and the operational objectives of local government. These experiments have focused on diverse operations activities including; public engagement and consultation, service transformation, behaviour change and community resilience. These collaborative experiments have acted as demonstrators of the potential for such collaborations and their value. Reflection on these activities has delivered insights and recommendations that have informed ongoing collaboration between the participating organisations and been shared with other local authorities and HEIs. Specific results have included models and guidance for future collaboration of this kind and strengthened local, regional and international networks across local government, design education and the third sector that have supported progression around co-production of public services.
5. An independent evaluation of the practices of the PCL conducted by the Institute for Local Government, University of Birmingham, has identified the value, strengths and weaknesses of this approach and informed recommendations for future collaboration of this kind.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Locally the research outcomes are being taken forward via ongoing collaboration between Camden Council and University of the Arts London developing and extending the PCL collaborative platform both online and offline and integrating third sector involvement further via collaboration with Voluntary Action Camden. Also, via dissemination and training events to be delivered to colleagues interested to engage in collaborations of this kind.
Nationally the research outcomes will be progressed via dissemination in collaboration with advisors to the project such as the Local Government Information Unit, who are a membership organisation with over 200 local authorities registered. Also, INLOGOV, Birmingham who have an established network of local authority collaborators keen to review the results of their evaluation. Also, via dissemination activity linked to the UK DESIS network of design universities engaged in research and teaching for design for social innovation in the UK. Our plan is to apply for follow on funding to deliver a series of regional workshops up and down the UK in collaboration with these partners to work with local government officers and design educators to develop the insights and recommendations from the research into appropriate resources to enable local delivery of similar collaborative initiatives.
Internationally, there is already a move to establish a 'thematic cluster' within the DESIS network to transfer and scale learning around the topic of local government/design education collaboration which has received interest from Tongi University in China, Parsons University and Carnegie Mellon University in the USA, Polytechnico di Milano in Italy amongst others. PCL is also partner in a submission to H2020 to explore this theme linked to co-creation of public services.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>33F32A66-22B6-4577-AED9-EAF6CC0039D0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.publiccollaborationlab.</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Future Libraries creative consultation findings</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ECD53F84-1E84-4339-BDDF-E63720AAB78F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Future Libraries' creative consultation findings identified and demonstrated a synergy between local governments' operational objectives around public engagement and consultation and design educations' learning objectives linked to experiential learning in relation to design research methods and research through design. Findings form Future Libraries' creative consultations have fed into a report to the Cabinet Office informing decisions made regarding the future of Camden's libraries. The success of the project has catalysed further requests for collaboration with design education in citizen engagement and consultation in diverse local government service contexts including Planning and Development Management and Youth Services.

Camden Council Legal Services feedback was positive about the potential for this new collaborative, creative approach to public engagement and consultation and stated that: &amp;quot;Cabinet Office guidance (published in 2012) on consultation principles states in particular that 'the information that is provided as part of the consultation should be useful and accessible and the objectives of the consultation should be clear. Instead of a formal written consultation, consideration should be given to more informal ways of engaging with stakeholders, for example e-mail or web-based forums, public meetings, working groups, focus groups and surveys.' The work the students have undertaken clearly achieves this aim, and provided some very useful and insightful data we may not have otherwise obtained. Whilst I don't think it would replace more formal written consultations, I think it is a very useful supplement to this, and could be used in a variety of ways (e.g. to narrow down options that can then be consulted on in more detail, or engage with more difficult to reach groups as part of the consultation itself).&amp;quot;

Following this feedback the approach has been shared with local government officers from many UK local authorities concerned with consultation and engagement via free workshops hosted by Camden Council and University of the Arts London.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in LB Camden report to cabinet on Libraries</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>184E838E-1E21-4F8C-9A5D-39E5BE161BA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of findings to council stakeholders contributed to the decision not to close any public libraries in London Borough of Camden.

The purpose of this questionnaire was to increase understanding of HEI's role in supporting innovation practices within local government, through design collaborations. The questionnaire consisted of three sections (1) organisation background, (2) projects that best represent the way in which the organisation collaborates with local governments (3) relationship with the organisation with other local authorities.

An invitation to complete the online questionnaire has been emailed to 159 universities and colleges across the United Kingdom. There are no ethical or legal constrains, as the questionnaire is voluntary and anonymous. A questionnaire for local governments was sent out in March 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>37E6A841-151C-4F6B-BDEA-5BBCD336C0E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The questionnaire has been instrumental in identifying collaborations between design HEI and local government that is not included in available databases (such as RCUK, HEFCE, REF) and so addresses a gap in knowledge.

This research database provides novel information regarding the types of collaboration between design HEI and local governments, including but not limited to: financial support, design disciplines, thematic areas, scale of the collaboration, design contribution to public sector innovation, pathways through engagement, pathways through collaboration, etc.

This research will inform the development of mapping of design collaboration between UK universities and local governments, and typologies that seek to provide guidance and facilitate collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Online questionnaire for Higher Education Institutions and local governments</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The collaborative design experiments delivered within the portfolio of the PCL project included the development and application of a suite of Creative engagement tools. Creative engagement tools are devices or implements designed to carry out a specific function, in this case, to creatively engage users, members of the public or other stakeholders in design research to elicit information. Creative engagement, or co-design tools as Daam et al. describe them, value people as the experts of their own experiences (Daam et al., 2013). These designed socio-material interactions were seen to engage and assemble new publics in the exploration of needs and values relating to public service and public policy innovation. Examples from the projects include:
? Stitch Map
? Library Bureau
? Library Expedition
