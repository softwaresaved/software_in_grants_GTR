In September 2013 Preston Bus Station was granted listed Grade II status following a sustained period of campaigning that involved conservation societies, architectural enthusiasts, local activists, artists, filmmakers and everyday bus users supporting this example of Brutalist architecture. Such widespread public support and interest in post-war modernism (although long the focus of architectural conservation societies) is a recent phenomenon. It took fifteen years of lobbying and campaigning to get Preston Bus Station listed, yet it was only in the last two years that the fate of this municipally owned building became something that garnered national and international attention. This is a reflection of the new and diverse interpretations of modern architecture that are now emerging, and of the novel activist and creative alliances that are being formed to celebrate and campaign for particular buildings and styles. 

Coming at a moment when post-war architectural modernism is the focus of growing interest, but is still controversial and contested, an examination of the possible futures of this building style is critical and timely. Drawing on the perspectives of academics, professionals and community groups, the network will ask, for example, how is modern architecture valued (economically, socially and politically)? Who is speaking out for this architectural style? What groups and alliances have formed around particular buildings threatened with demolition? What gets knocked down, what gets saved? Who decides - market forces or public opinion? How might modern buildings be adapted and reused if their original purpose is no longer relevant? What does listed status mean for modern buildings? A safe future, or being destined to be mothballed as examples of 'historic interest'? The answers will provide new directions for conservation and regeneration policy, academic debate, and creative practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond the academic community, this research network will yield direct benefits for a range of policy-makers and public sector partners (including the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, the Department of Communities and Local Government, local councils, and English Heritage), third sector partners (The Twentieth Century Society, Docomomo), and private sector partners (architects and property developers, creative industries such as graphic designers and artists) involved with the network. It will also benefit local community groups and a wider interested public who care and campaign for modern architecture. 

Potential impact therefore lies both in the direct exchange of ideas in the network between academics and these broader communities of interest and professional practice, and in the dissemination of the network's findings to the wider public. This engagement will be facilitated both through external-facing activity, such as construction of the publically-accessible website dedicated to the network, and through the three workshops and two film showings, which, through their diverse geographical locations (London, Preston, and Glasgow) will engage diverse communities of interest. 

The research will benefit Government and Third Sector partners by contributing directly to policy making with regard to the listing and conservation of modern architecture. Insights from others invested in architectural modernism from a number of perspectives will:
 - Enable critical discussions over listing decisions to take place, providing insights for future policy changes and developing understanding between different stakeholders. 
 - Increase the effectiveness of public policy and services around architectural heritage by increasing professional and public understanding of, and engagement in, listing, planning and development decisions.
 - Highlight the collaborative opportunities for campaigning, education and redevelopment offered by partnering with other groups. 

The Research network will yield benefits for Creative industry partners by providing:
 - Opportunities to communicate their diverse and novel ways of documenting, understanding and celebrating modern architecture with policy makers, government, and third sector groups involved in architectural conservation and through this, influence current and future policy and practice. 
 - Opportunities to collaborate with academics to reflect on their own creative practice. 

Local community groups will benefit through:
 - The sharing of best practice around education and campaigning.
 - The networking opportunities (with similar groups, as well as with policy, third sector and private sector organisations) afforded by the events. 

Local government, planners, architects and developers will benefit directly and indirectly through the insights produced through the network's discussions and outputs, which will:
 - Clarify current and possible future policy directions
 - Provide evidence of current best practice around architectural conservation with regard to collaboration between private, public and community stakeholders. 
 - Produce new understandings of the economic, social and cultural value of modernist buildings and the ways that these can be preserved and harnessed 
 - Suggest ways in which creative solutions can be applied in plans for reuse and redevelopment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17052</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An exhibition of archive and contemporary photographs of Manchester's 20th century urban fabric.
