Our investigation wants to focus on two important themes which underpin a lot of financial models: distributional assumptions and efficiency. The four seminars which are planned in this series will be addressing the following specific methodological aims.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first seminar has as goal to understand what the historical and legal ?causes? are of the 2008 crisis. The second seminar will want to analyse what the consequences are of the 2008 crisis upon&amp;nbsp; the empirical modelling of the distributional assumptions/efficiency. The third and fourth seminars will be concerned with the mathematical modelling aspects in regards to distributional assumptions/efficiency, post 2008. Specifically, the before last seminar will consider stochastic approaches, while the last seminar will be preoccupied with assessing the viability in financial modelling of non-stochastic approaches.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? The following parties will benefit from the series:
+Academics in banking and finance, sociology of finance, business, financial and economic history, and in general academics that have an interest in understanding some of the essentials which relate to the 2008 crisis. 
+Senior policy makers and advisers from the government, Bank of England, Financial Stability Authority and other financial institutions 
+Financial journalists
+Early career researchers
+Doctoral students


How will they benefit? 
We will invite members of the above communities to attend different sessions, also as a presenter or discussant, to encourage interaction and knowledge transfer between the different parties. The seminar series will provide a forum for the exchange and development of theoretical, empirical and policy ideas, and function as a primary mechanism for disseminating findings, and most importantly it will facilitate communication and exchange of information between experts from academia, finance professionals, central bankers and early career researchers and doctoral students. The book and special volume in a leading finance journal will collect selected papers. We have set aside a part of the budget for the funding of 1 hotel night for 6 doctoral students. We also have set aside a budget for the funding of subsistence for 6 early career researchers and 6 doctoral students (over the four 2-day seminars we intend to organize). Finally, we are adamant about setting up a special section entitled 'The future of Post-2008 Financial Modelling: the non-academic point of view' on the website at the Institute of Finance, of the University of Leicester (http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/finance). This special section will serve a dual purpose. First, it will be used to further engage (after all the four 2-day seminars are over) on the issues discussed and debated at the four 2-day seminars. The emphasize will be on issues which are relevant to non-academics and practitioners. Second, the special section will serve as a repository of talks which will be held at the Institute of Finance under the topic of 'The future of Post-2008 Financial Modelling: the non-academic point of view'. Those talks will have the defining characteristic they will all be given by non-academics. Please note that those talks will follow after all the four 2-day seminars are over. The website will be clearly accessible to the wider non-academic public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17998</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement with students of the published Handbook</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B50C4CB5-6E98-4343-9E33-3B93E85F9251</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This year (2016) - the principal investigator, used the published handbook, in the second year Undergraduate module - Financial Management.

Theme I: Historical and legal origins of the 2008 crisis (hosted at Bangor University by Professor Phil Molyneux) addresses the question of the 'source' of the 2008 crisis. Was bank sector deregulation a major factor? How important was the bonus culture in explaining the 2008 crisis? What are the regulatory origins of the crisis and the risks faced by the European banking system? 33 academics (including the speakers; doctoral students) registered for this first seminar. Speakers were drawn from the University of Cambridge; the Bank of England; Tilburg University (Netherlands); Vanderbilt University (USA). Attendees came from the National Grid; Sunderland University; Universities of Leicester and Coventry. 

Theme II: Empirical modelling; distributional assumptions/efficiency (hosted at St. Andrews University by Professor John Wilson) addressed the difficult topic of how empirical modelling is affected by changes in the distributional assumptions and efficiency considerations after the 2008 crisis event. Efficiency and the shadow price of capital was considered. The relation between size of banks and efficiency was considered. Technical challenges were also actively discussed. As an example there were papers on dynamic market timing and the use of shortage functions in preference modelling. The seminar was attended by some doctoral students. Speakers were drawn from the University of Glasgow; Loughborough University; the University of Edinburgh; CNRS (France) and Boston University (USA).

Theme III: Empirical modelling; distributional assumptions/efficiency (stochastic models) (hosted at the University of Manchester by Professor Sergei Fedotov) addressed probably the most difficult topic of the seminar series: can mathematical finance really deliver upon the very complex demands the financial system is asking from that community? We discussed the situation that if the 2008 crisis were to repeat itself, would bank bail outs or nationalizations be an option? What was the role of real estate in the crisis (when it was considered as an underlying asset in option positions)? Can mathematical finance deliver a 'number' which indicates the risk a bank or hedge fund is facing? Technical issues were also addressed in this seminar, such as how perturbation problems arise in finance. 38 academics (including the speakers; doctoral students) registered for this seminar. Speakers were drawn from the University of Manchester; Imperial College; University of Nottingham and Loughborough University.

Finally, theme IV: Empirical modelling; distributional asumptions/efficiency (non-stochastic models) (hosted at the University of Leicester by Professor Emmanuel Haven and Dr. Meryem Duygun) addressed the potential for new models (for instance non-stochastic models) in finance. Some talks attempted to model the role of information in finance with novel tools (at least for finance). As an example how can Fisher information and potential functions be used in finance? What is wrong with the exponentially discounted utility model? Can a crisis be predicted? Several academics (including some doctoral students) from the University of Leicester (including from departments outside of social science, such as Physics) attended the talks. Speakers were drawn from the Fields Institute (University of Toronto, Canada); University of Arizona (USA); University of Leicester; Universit&amp;agrave; di Palermo (Italy) and Deutsche Bank (Germany).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We need to wait to see what the impact of the book will be.

At the time of writing this report (March 3 - 2016), the book is now available in published form (published by Palgrave MacMillan).
