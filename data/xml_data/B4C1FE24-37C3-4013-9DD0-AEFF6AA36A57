1. To support science education by looking at light from the revolutionary discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton to real life applications of the electromagnetic spectrum and how it shapes our modern day lives. Young people take microwaves, mobile phones, remote controls and satellite navigation systems for granted but they often do not understand how and why they work. Linking science teaching to everyday hands-on activities is an effective tool for encouraging young people to take a more positive attitude towards Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). 
2. To raise awareness of current research. Establishing links with research facilities will assist in the communication of new knowledge, allowing the wider audience to gain an insight into areas of science they may otherwise be unaware of. These links will help to show how discoveries made by detecting energy across the whole of the electromagnetic spectrum has revolutionised how we see the Universe and how we can use some of these discoveries in everyday life. 
3. To immerse the wider audience in audible signals from space. Most people who are not in the field of Astronomy and Space will be unaware that electromagnetic energies can be detected and translated into audible signals as well as visible images, or that radio signals for example are indeed part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The aim is to link images with sound signals and explain the relationship between light and sound. 
4. To celebrate International Year of Light and Light based Technologies (IYL2015) by engaging a wide audience from all walks of life, all ages and all abilities with the exciting 'science of light' through physics, chemistry, biology and astronomy. Introducing subjects in a fun interactive way and through different media often helps those with little or no knowledge of the subject to better understand difficult concepts. 

The overall impact of this ambitious project will be to inspire, engage and help as many people as possible to understand the fascinating world of light and light based technologies, from everyday items and modern day life to astronomy and space. The Observatory Science Centre has received funding from STFC in the past either directly or through the Association of Science and Discovery Centres (ASDC) which has a relevance to this project ('The Solar Physics Experience' 2007 and 'Explore Your Universe: from atoms to astrophysics' [EYU] through ASDC and delivered during 2013). The resources from these projects can be combined and redeveloped into relevant workshops etc. thus ensuring the legacy of past projects through continuing updates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The science centre website will form the hub for information sharing and a media campaign will also help to advertise events and activities throughout the year. Local press, radio and television will be targeted with press releases and social media and networking will provide a valuable outlet for continuous updates and publicity. The centre already has an extensive database of free listing outlets. A regular newsletter will be written and emailed to our visitor database and in-house advertising will emphasise all the extra events and activities being organised for IYL2015. 

STEM Sussex will be approached for disseminating information to schools and the centre's events and activities will be posted on the dedicated IYL2015 website to encourage and engage in networking around the world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9993</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The award is still on going as the funding for the project started later than anticipated.
