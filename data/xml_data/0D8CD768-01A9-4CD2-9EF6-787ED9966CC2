They will identify the practical, political and research challenges posed by the current policy enthusiasm for particular branches of positive psychology, wellbeing, happiness, flourishing and 'mindfulness'.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Behaviour Change is a significant, topical and controversial issue in the UK (and internationally) with specific implications for changing policy making and the skills and knowledge of civil servants and service providers, as these positions increasingly require awareness of new debates in the psychological and behavioural sciences. The seminars have the potential to increase the effectiveness of public services and policy, change cultures of service delivery amongst private and third sector organisations and increase public engagement with research and societal issues. 

There are 3 impact objectives (engage, communicate and disseminate) which involve 8 impact activities: direct engagement with Behaviour Change practitioners and policy makers in the seminars, including one hosted by Collaborative Change social enterprise at a public venue; communication with target audiences through a research blog, website, 2 non-academic professional articles, a research briefing sent to 20 Behaviour Change Organisations, dissemination to a wider interested public through 3 press releases, and 1 research briefing sent to the Campaign for Social Science. 

Who will benefit (target audiences)? 
(1)Public sector organizations and government departments responsible for the promotion and/or delivery of Behaviour Change initiatives, particularly: the Department of Health, DEFRA, DECC, the Behavioural Insights Team at the Cabinet Office, and divisions of both the Welsh Government and the Scottish Executive who are working on public health or climate change communications; 
(2)Third Sector and Social Enterprise organizations delivering Behaviour Change relating to health and the environment, such as: Global Action Plan, Common Cause, National Social Marketing Centre, School Food Trust, Action on Smoking and Health, Collaborative Change, Action for Happiness, MindApples; 
(3)Commercial organizations who promote neuromarketing, neuroarchitecture, positive psychology, wellbeing and mindfulness: Positive Psychology UK; The Centre for Confidence and Well-being (Glasgow); Centre of Applied Positive Psychology (Coventry); Positive Psychology Training - the Wellbeing Consultancy (Bristol).
(4)The general public who have an initial interest in Behaviour Change, 'nudge' inspired policies, and changing practices of governance.

How will they benefit?
Non-academic beneficiaries will find the seminar series relevant because speakers and participants will:
(a) identify and communicate the underlying assumptions, methods and politics of Behaviour Change; 
(b) draw out commonalities and differences in how Behaviour Change is being rolled out in different domains;
(c) identify and communicate the planned outcomes and, conversely, the unintended consequences of Behaviour Change; 
(d) share and encourage understanding of the challenges faced by promoters and practitioners of Behaviour Change initiatives; 
(e) supplement the existing theoretical and practical resources available to policymakers and third sector organizations by drawing on insights from theoretical developments in the behavioural and social sciences on the relationship between brains and society, and demonstrating its implications for wider democratic practice.

The seminars will maximize impact by negotiating two extremes characterizing Behaviour Change research. One paradigm remains technocratic and uncritical in its approach to solving the problem of how to change people's behaviours, taking psychological and behavioural science research at face value. The other exaggerates the desire and capacity that generic 'public policy makers' have for manipulating the minds and decisions of citizens. By bringing together non-academic practitioners of Behaviour Change initiatives with critical social scientists, we develop a more nuanced account of the ethics of Behaviour Change and the legitimate forms, techniques and extent of governmental intervention in minds, brains and behaviour.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23870</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings of this seminar series are research seminars.

Overview
Dr Jessica Pykett is the PI of a two year ESRC funded seminar series from 2013-2015. The seminars investigate the development of Behaviour Change in public policy, and the effects of such forms of governance on national populations and specific social groups across different fields of policy and practice. 

Progress to Date (Jan 2016) 
The research seminar series was aimed at developing an international network of scholarship on behaviour change and psychological governance. It has achieved the following objectives:
1. To provide an international forum to investigate the political and ethical dimensions of the 'Behaviour Change' agenda in public policy, examining the intersections between the psychological sciences, spaces of governance and state power.
2. To engage with social science researchers, policy makers and practitioners of Behaviour Change initiatives in order to better understand: 
a. how particular psychological insights are used and taken up by governments;
b. what infrastructures of governing are required in order to mobilise these psychological insights, and to what ends;
c. the theoretical and methodological assumptions made in accounts of the brain, mind and behaviour in public policy;
d. the potential for developing new theoretical grounds from which to supplement, challenge and where necessary rework the contemporary resurgence of forms of behavioural governance.
3. To build on an emerging international body of research from critical neuroscientists, psychologists and geographers which has demonstrated the sociological, political and philosophical implications of behavioural approaches to governance.
4. To exchange knowledge on Behaviour Change with policy makers and practitioners, with the broader intention of involving users in the setting of research priorities for future research.
5. To provide opportunities for research collaboration and networking, including internationally, bringing together researchers from different disciplines and at different careers stages.
6. To produce a number of research outputs and publications for audiences which include academics, public, third and commercial sector organisations, and more general interested publics.
Outcomes
Six research seminars were held at the universities of Birmingham, Bristol, Durham, Aberystwyth and at the Royal Society for the Arts, London. The research has engaged an international and interdisciplinary audience on the topics of behavioural change and psychological governance, covering topics including:

1. Changing spaces, urban planning and neuroarchitecture (Bristol)
2. Psychological resilience. Governing the brain, mind and behaviour (Birmingham)
3. Re-Theorising 'Behaviour Change' (Durham)
4. Silver Bullets Need A Careful Aim. Dilemmas in applying behavioural insights (RSA, London)
5. Critical Dialogues on Psychology, Behaviour and Brain Science: Graduate and Early Career Summer School (Aberystwyth)
6. The Politics and Economics of Attention (Bristol)


Highlights
1. The involvement of 7 high profile international speakers from a range of disciplinary backgrounds, including neuroarchitecture, psychology, sociology, philosophy, geography and cultural studies.
2. The involvement of best-selling author, Matthew Crawford (University of Virginia, USA) at the final seminar in Bristol. The event was highlighted by the Bristol Festival of Ideas.
3. The involvement of several non-academic speakers and participants, including from organisations such as Which, Citizens Advice, Global Action Plan, Action for Happiness, Mindfulness and Social Change Network, Ministry of Justice, Health and Safety Executive, Collaborative Change, the RSA, Scottish Government an advisor to the UK Behavioural Insights Team.
4. The collaboration with Collaborative Change/Considered behaviour change consultancy, which led to a seminar held at the RSA and a co-authored report 'Silver Bullets need a careful aim. Dilemmas in Applying Behavioural Insights' which has been shared with Manchester City Council, Behavioural Insights Team, Price Waterhouse Coopers, amongst others. This publication was aimed at public, third and commercial sector audiences.
5. One of the seminars was committed to providing a supportive forum for postgraduate and early career researchers (seminar 5). This gave an opportunity for PG/ECRs to present their own research on the seminar themes. A career advice workshop session was delivered by experienced professors. Several speakers had been to many of the other seminars. Financial support was provided for PGs to attend seminars.
6. Publication of think pieces/seminar commentaries for a public audience, published through the seminar series website http://psychologicalgovernance.wordpress.com (6000 views) and Psychology Today blog (audience of over 1million).
