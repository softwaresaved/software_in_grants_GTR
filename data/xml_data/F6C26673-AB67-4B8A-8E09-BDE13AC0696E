It asks how the experiences and practices of irregular migrants are impacted by changing policies in border security and asylum, and also how these patterns of migration are themselves driving policy change. The project has a particular focus on how security efforts that attempt to respond to human trafficking and people smuggling (and that often conflate the two) are impacting the vulnerabilities of migrants, particularly asylum seekers, as they cross maritime borders. In pursuing these questions, this research prioritises the experiences and perspectives of migrants themselves by using innovative qualitative methods that enable migrants to tell their own stories, in their own ways. The objectives of this project are to place the migrant experience at the centre of our understanding of irregular maritime migration, to bring local case studies together to reveal global patterns of policy change, and to understand how the maritime space offers opportunities to rethink how we understand the international realm.

The project is built around two case studies: the Pacific Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. In both cases, two migration routes will be studied. For the Pacific, the journey that transits through Indonesia to Australia, and that which transits through Thailand to Canada are the focus; in the Mediterranean, the journeys examined are from Morocco to Spain, and from Libya to Italy. To understand these routes, in-depth field research will be undertaken in the four destination states (Australia, Canada, Spain, and Italy) in order to trace the experience of migrants backwards from their destination through their migration journeys. These experiences will be analyzed against patterns of policy change in each state, and of interstate cooperation and governance at regional and global levels to reveal how states have responded to the arrival of boats carrying undocumented migrants, and how these responses have then impacted the mobility of these individuals.

The guiding research method is ethnography, which includes participant observation, unstructured interviews, and visual ethnographies. The visual ethnographies represent a new method, and will allow migrants themselves to tell their own stories through video and photography. These pieces will then be made available on the Project Website, and will be screened at a final Public Engagement Event. Ethnographies will also be supported by semi-structured interviews and by policy analysis. 

Throughout the project, this research will be supported by comprehensive skills development for the researcher, which includes methodology training, the development of academic and practitioner networks, and the development of leadership skills and opportunities in the field.

The research in this project will enhance our understanding of irregular migration and processes of political change that impact border security and asylum politics. This will be reflected in several journal articles, and a final book manuscript that will be submitted for review at the end of the project. 
 
This research will also have important non-academic impacts. Through activities that include the Website and Public Event noted above, targeted Workshops in each research site, and the regular publication of Briefing Notes and Project Reports, this project will build and enhance cross-community networks. The key audiences for this research include the general public, policy makers, advocacy and support workers, and migrants themselves. Through this research, policy debates will be informed by deeper understandings of irregular migration. Further, the activities and publications of the project will build new opportunities for communication, and for consultation and collaboration in developing more effective and humane responses to the challenges posed by irregular migration across water.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are four distinct audiences impacted by this study: 
1) General Public:
The general public is regularly exposed to media stories about irregular migration, particularly in relation to security concerns. However, awareness and informed understanding of key issues is often limited. The public for this project comprises both the public in each destination state, where research will take place, and also the UK public.

2) Policy Makers:
The policy makers impacted by this study work at both national and international levels. Nationally, they are civil servants and politicians tasked with writing immigration and asylum legislation and related regulations. Internationally, they are members of the diplomatic core and global governance bodies concerned with facilitating inter-state cooperation and response in migration management.

3) Advocacy and Support Workers:
These individuals work 'on the ground' with irregular arrivals. They operate emergency responses, including rescues, run support and health services for both the newly arrived, also those awaiting asylum decisions. They also actively lobby government actors for increased resources and for policy change with regard to irregular migration, border security, and asylum policy.

4)Migrants:
Migrants comprise those individuals who have engaged in the irregular crossing of borders. They may have been granted status in the destination country, such as asylum or a humanitarian protection visa. Their irregularity is defined herein by their means of arrival. Although this study focuses on migrants who have crossed maritime space, irregular migrants who cross over land are also beneficiaries of this research as it contributes to wider understanding of irregular migration and of the impacts of border security and asylum policies. 

These audiences will benefit from this research in three ways:
1) An enhanced public understanding of irregular migration.
This research will enhance understanding of the processes and practices of maritime irregular migration for the General Public, which will facilitate a deeper engagement with both Advocacy and Support Workers in their activities, and Policy Makers as they undertake policy development and change. This impact will also enhance the public awareness of who irregular migrants are, why they undertake their journeys, and what challenges and vulnerabilities they face. This will contribute to countering xenophobia within society for Migrants, enhancing possibilities for social inclusion and integration. This impact will be realised particularly through the Project Website and the Public Engagement Event.

2) An enhanced and informed national and international policy debate about migration issues 
The debate about irregular migration, border security and asylum policy directly engages all four of these audiences. An enhanced understanding of these issues will facilitate greater engagement in policy debates for all audiences. The consequences and implications of current domestic policies, and of patterns of regional and global cooperation and governance, will be better understood. This will facilitate informed debates about policy development and change at both the national and international levels. This impact will be realised through the dissemination of Briefing Notes and Project Reports, and through the Project Website.

3) Enhanced opportunities for communication, consultation and collaboration
An effective and humane response to irregular migration demands open communication and collaboration amongst stakeholders, which requires greater degrees of understanding and trust across communities. This research will facilitate these dynamics, developing networks across all audiences, enhancing mutual understanding, and building new opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration. This impact will be realised via Site-Specific Workshops, Briefing Notes, Project Reports, and the Project Website.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139918</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Brexit for Migrants: What does it mean?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>203D5A12-AA91-4E0A-AFF6-CB1F8F96F42C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited speaker at an information and planning workshop hosted by the Northern Irish Council for Ethnic Minorities on the impact of Brexit on the migrant community</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>To Make Live: Refugee subjectivities in representation, and protest</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D0F2BF01-8AA6-4F84-B23D-394FC4F7C7B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited Speaker at public symposium: 8th International Symposium for Locality and Humanities: Local Narratives and the Politics of Representation, Korean Studies Institute, Pusan National University, South Korea</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Taking Pictures:  Imagining the Refugee Crisis</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0D490FEF-0410-42BE-849A-F2B2D58E7F0B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A public lecture delivered October 4 2016 at George Washington University.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6256FF38-05EE-48A8-866B-A2EF0DAC152B"><gtr:id>6256FF38-05EE-48A8-866B-A2EF0DAC152B</gtr:id><gtr:title>To Make Live: Representing and Protesting Refugee Agency</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Localities</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1e9c79f88bef4c818bdff4471a71deb1"><gtr:id>1e9c79f88bef4c818bdff4471a71deb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Johnson H L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N001990/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
