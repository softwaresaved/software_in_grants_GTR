Network</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K003216/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The science of climate modelling and prediction has developed in the past twenty years to become a science where advances can directly and quickly influence international, national government and enterprise policy. While much of the progress in these aspects of climate science have been via a combination of improved earth observation, more powerful computers and better understanding of feedbacks in the earth system, mathematics and statistics have played an underpinning role in generating, solving and validating numerical models. It is an area of science where the UK has demonstrated leadership that goes from the development of numerical weather prediction to strong representation of UK science and scientists on the current Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), distinguished by a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

Mathematics and statistics have played a major role in many advances in climate modelling and prediction, and these contributions have been in both directions, for example, the seminal Lorenz (1963) model is continuing to have a great impact on the field of dynamical systems and their statistical properties and is still the model of choice for a simple nonlinear dynamical system. However, the Mathematical Sciences have often been seen as a toolbox rather than an equal partner with Climate Science. This division is institutionalized in the UK in a number of ways - core funding for Climate Science in the UK is from NERC, DECC and DEFRA while Mathematics and Statistics is seen as an EPSRC responsibility; even the more theoretical research is often based within Earth Science, Physics and/or Meteorology departments rather than Mathematics or Statistics; although one could identify &amp;quot;Mathematics for Earth Sciences&amp;quot; as an internationally successful cognate activity.

We believe that wider engagement with the Mathematical Sciences have the potential to contribute much more to answering the key questions (in particular understanding and reducing uncertainties in observation and prediction). By engaging a wide range of Mathematics and Statistics researchers on a number of scientific themes, CliMathNet aims to stimulate discussion and progress on these themes by entraining the expertise of mathematicians and statisticians.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic impact: This network should have a lasting impact in integrating the climate modelling and prediction community much more closely with the mathematical sciences community. As an example, the recent (2nd) Review of the Tyndall Centre's Climate Research Unit chaired by Lord Oxburgh highlighted need for climate modellers to work more closely with professional statisticians: &amp;quot;We cannot help remarking that it is very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians. Indeed there would be mutual benefit if there were closer collaboration [with] a much wider scientific group outside the relatively small international circle of temperature specialists.&amp;quot; 

Societal impact: This network should have a lasting impact in a number of societal areas. This includes (a) the development of improved data and tools for policymaker by recognizing and reducing uncertainty. (b) Inspiring young researchers to engage with issues at the interface of mathematical sciences/climate science and by doing this to maintain UK leadership in these fields. (c) Public engagement, for example, by highlighting the international &amp;quot;Mathematics for Planet Earth&amp;quot; initiative during 2013.

Economic impact: The network should have a lasting impact in terms of developing new mathematical and statistical techniques that help to improve predictions and in turn make the UK's economy more resilient in the light of a changing environment. Engagement with the Tyndall Centre and with the Industrial Mathematics KTN will ensure that this impact is achieved.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>189808</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting ECMWF</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ECMWF</gtr:description><gtr:id>16585B55-4AAB-45A9-92A1-D51A63E86BA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multi-disciplinary, mathematics and meteorology.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Members of ECMWF have attended and contributed to workshops and conferences, and the network.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We assisted in ECMWF running a workshop on novel numerical methods for weather forecasting, in collaboration with CliMathNet.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of East Anglia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Tyndall Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>Tyndall Centre</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE3B1646-991A-49D3-AC62-2A497DCD7CCB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Participation in ClIMathNet eevntsand as part of advisory board.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>ClMathNet has highlighted areas felt by Tyndall centre to be where scientific developments are needed for climate science.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Met Office</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Met Office</gtr:description><gtr:id>F109DB5B-2FB9-41DA-9058-31D9609D8DA0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multi-disciplinary collaboration between mathematics, statistics, numerical weather prediction and climate science.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Participation in conferences and workshops, membership of network, time to contribute to advisory board and policy meetings.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have run a number of workshops and conferences that have enabled members of this partnership to gain access to ongoing research of relevance to the Met Office.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>mathMETics</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>282585F1-4694-4CD0-BDD5-DC02B73D54B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The mathMETics project is designed to demonstrate the role of mathematics in meteorology, by using mathematics lessons and activites to investigate weather observation and forecasting.

Understanding the earth's climate system poses many of the challenges that exist more widely in systems far from equilibrium. There are non-linear processes acting across a broad range of spatio-temporal scales, the system is driven and is far from equilibrium. In addition, we have only one realization of our (changing) climate and observational data is very limited. This workshop sought to bring some of the ideas and methodology of non-equilibrium dynamics to bear on understanding the dynamics and variability of climate events, extremes and the emergence of spatio-temporal correlations.

The workshop brought scientists from a broad spectrum of the climate community together with decision makers, policy advisors, and members of the statistical and decision analysis communities to faciliate research and knowledge transfer. There was a series of talks from each of the different communities focused on relevant existing tools for decision support, including description of different climate models, products and data as well as general methodology from decision analysis and talks from the user community. Breakout sessions were employed to encourage ideas for novel multi-disciplinary approaches to the provision of decision support and the development of policy support tools, both within the current constraints of the available models and processes generated for the IPCC cycle (for example, CMIP); and with an eye on more idealized or blue-sky frameworks specifically tailored to the requirements of policy makers.
