Around 1 in 20 children will show such great difficulty in everyday movement tasks that it interferes with their school-work, impairs their ability and desire to participate in sports, and lowers their overall life-satisfaction. Such children are said to have developmental coordination disorder (DCD), a condition that might once have been known as 'clumsiness'. As yet, despite a growing interest in studying developmental disorders, we do not yet know which part (or parts) of the brain is affected in this disorder, and how the growth and development of such brain areas may relate to the child's ability to tie their shoelaces, catch balls, or write legibly.

This research project will test the hypothesis that the brain areas responsible for the rapid analysis of sensory information and movement signals, and for eye-hand coordination, are damaged in children with DCD. The most important brain region involved in the coordination of our body from moment to moment is the cerebellum, or 'little brain'. Sitting at the top of the spinal cord, and at the back of the head, the cerebellum receives hundreds of millions of inputs, and processes them before sending signals to the spinal cord to control the body, and back up to the brain to feed back what the body is now doing. One good example of what the cerebellum may do best is what happens when you slip on a patch of ice - one foot suddenly lunges forward unexpectedly, but the rest of your body stiffens and tenses, your arms jerk out, your body twists, but somehow you stay standing up! All of this super-rapid processing of information by the brain happens before you are even aware of the ice underfoot. The cerebellum is the gate-keeper between the body and the brain, filtering and smoothing, blocking and permitting the brain's commands to reach the body. For the very fine, or the very fast control of movement, the cerebellum is indispensable.

By taking a number of images of the cerebellum and the rest of the brain in a medical brain scanner, we will be able to link the size, health, and connectivity of the cerebellum with people's ability to make the kinds of rapid hand-eye-coordination movements that are impaired in DCD. As well as taking brain recordings, we will also ask adults and children to reach forwards and grasp an illuminated ping-pong ball. Sometimes, just after they start to reach for the ball, we will turn off the light inside the ball, and light up another ball just a few centimetres away. The question is: after the light has switched between the first and second balls, how quickly can adults, and children with and without DCD, move their hand to grab the second ball? In previous studies, people have been shown to switch their hand movements between the two balls in just 0.1 seconds - the same amount of time that would cause a 'false start' in an Olympic running or swimming event. This suggests that, while we are making a reaching movement our brain is, so to speak, one step ahead of us - that it is predicting where our hand should be, and very rapidly adjusting our hand movements before we are even aware that the object has moved.

The long-term goal in DCD research is to discover behavioural, pharmacological, or other treatments to improve the motor coordination of hundreds of thousands of children. By helping to identify the underlying circuits involved, and pinpointing the sites of dysfunctional development in DCD, this project will play an important role in achieving that goal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The parietal and motor cortices work with the cerebellum in planning, executing, and controlling reaching and grasping movements towards objects. In developmental coordination disorder (DCD), a neurodevelopmental disorder in the coordination of posture, gross, and fine arm and hand movements, the temporal and spatial control of reaching and grasping movements are some of the most impaired aspects of motor coordination. The leading hypothesis for the aetiology of DCD is an impairment of cerebellar function, but direct evidence is lacking. The proposed research will test the parietal-cerebellar hypothesis of DCD, and will also study in parallel the parietal-cerebellar control of reaching and grasping movements in healthy adults. The project will use motion tracking, electromyography, structural, metabolic, and functional neuroimaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation to provide a multi-method test of the hypothesis.

During grasping movements, error, inaccuracy, and target positions changes arise. The reaching movement must then be adapted on-line, to reduce the error, bringing the hand and target closer together. This on-line error correction process occurs for every movement, but takes some time. The most rapid movement corrections in humans begin at 90-120ms after an unexpected change in target object position, and consist first of a deceleration towards the initial target, then an acceleration towards the new target. Despite the robustness of this effect, the neural basis in humans is still debated, with only a handful of studies directly testing online control. In cats, lesions to the rubrospinal, tectospinal, propriospinal, and corticospinal tracts can delay online reaching corrections by 10-40ms, with the most rapid corrections mediated by cerebello-spinal pathways. 

Since some of the clearest deficits in DCD are incoordination of reaching and grasping, and delays in on-line control, this is an ideal model for testing the neural aetiology of DCD.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries outside the academic community have been identified as the children and parents participating in the research, special educational needs coordinators (SENCOs) and teachers, occupational therapists (OTs), paediatric neurologists, and the general public. The likely beneficiaries of the research, the likely time-scales of their benefit, and the means by which they may benefit are described below. 

By participating in the research, parents and their children are likely to learn about the child's motor behaviour and their brain, both individually, and in relation to the typically-developing child. This greater understanding may highlight areas in which the child shows particularly good or poor performance, and guide future schooling, care, or parenting. Parents may understand their children's brain and behaviour better as an immediate to short-term benefit of participating in the research. In the longer term, all parents of and childen with DCD may benefit.

Those children who, as a part of the study, are suspected as having or being at risk of developmental coordination disorder (DCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autistic spectrum conditions, dyslexia, or low IQ, are likely to benefit from this deficit being identified, and their being referred to an occupational therapist. These children may go on to receive additional educational attention, to improve at school, and to get the additional help that they need. Any such benefit is likely to begin several months or years after their involvement in the research, and could potentially improve lifelong health and well-being.

Every school has a SENCO. The SENCO coordinates and works with other teachers and with parents to ensure that the needs of children are met. SENCOs and other teachers involved with or learning about the project will benefit from increased awareness of developmental coordination disorder (during the project), and an increased understanding of the current state of the art of research in this area (during and towards the end of the project, as the results become available).

Much of OTs' work involves children with developmental coordination problems. They commonly use the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2 (M-ABC2) to assess children's motor skills. The project will also use this instrument to assess children. Since the M-ABC2 should not be repeated within three months for the same child, children tested as a part of our project may not need to be tested again by an OT, and vice versa. Local OTs are therefore likely to benefit, during the project, by the savings and sharing of time and resources from cooperation with the project's Researchers. Further benefit to local OTs is likely to arise during the project from our screening local children for developmental disorders, and the referrals into their care that the project's researchers will make. The wider population of OTs, as well as paediatric neurologists and other childcare and medical specialists, will also likely benefit, in the years after the results of the study are known and published, from a better understanding of the neurological bases of DCD, as well as a better evidence base from which to develop behavioural or possibly pharmacological interventions.

Those members of the general public involved or interested in the research may benefit, during and in the months and years after the project, from an increased awareness of and knowledge about DCD, and how the brain controls movement. A much longer-term (i.e., decades) benefit to the general public may also arise from decreases in the economic burden of DCD. Assuming that a neurological basis for the disorder can be identified, treatment interventions, whether behavioural or pharmacological (think of how ADHD is now commonly treated), could then better be targeted at the underlying deficit. Better identification and treatment interventions will decrease the cost of DCD to society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>461517</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DCD Support Group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0458E77-DE68-446C-92BB-FA7869918988</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of our ongoing research and plans to members of Nottingham's DCD (Dyspraxia) Support Group.
