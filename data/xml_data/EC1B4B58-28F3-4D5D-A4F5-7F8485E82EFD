At least 60 bacterial species are naturally transformable, a number that is thought to be considerably underestimated. Natural transformation is an extremely valuable tool for research and was instrumental to one of the most important discoveries in biology (i.e. that the genetic material is DNA). Moreover, it is now clear that horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation is a powerful mechanism for generating genetic diversity and a dominant force in bacterial evolution. This can have devastating consequences, e.g. by promoting spread of virulence or antibiotic resistance genes.

Type IV pili (Tfp), or related organelles, play a key role in DNA transformation. In addition, they are one of the most widespread colonization factors in bacteria. Therefore, Tfp have been and continue to be intensively studied as they might be primary targets for the development of new therapies against bacterial pathogens that place a heavy burden on human health and economy by infecting mankind, livestock and crops.

In current models, naked DNA needs to be bound by Tfp before it is taken up by the bacteria upon pilus retraction, but this remains to be formally demonstrated. The existence of a DNA receptor in Tfp is strengthened by the fact that in some species only self DNA is taken up because it contains a signature sequence motif known as the Uptake Sequence. In Neisseria, this DNA Uptake Sequence (DUS) motif is 10 bp long and is found in approx. 2,000 copies per genome. How competent bacteria bind DNA and are able to discriminate self from non-self DNA during uptake remains a mystery. The identification and analysis of a DUS receptor would represent a major breakthrough and would improve both our understanding of DNA transformation and Tfp biology in general.

This proposal originally derives from our recent characterization of N. meningitidis proteins involved in Tfp biology. Three of these proteins (ComP, PilV and PilX) are minor (low abundance) components of the Tfp. ComP plays a key role in competence. This prompted us to purify the ComP protein and test its DNA-binding activity, which led to a major finding: ComP has DNA-binding activity and shows a preference for the DUS (unpublished data). During this project, we plan to thoroughly characterize ComP's DNA-binding activity using biochemical and cellular assays, together with high resolution structural techniques.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Natural transformation is a widespread process by which bacteria, defined as genetically competent, take up naked DNA from the extracellular environment and incorporate it into their genomes.

Type IV pili (Tfp) usually play a key role in DNA transformation. It is tought that DNA is bound by Tfp before it is taken up by the bacteria upon pilus retraction, but this remains to be formally demonstrated. In Neisseria species, the existence of a specific DNA receptor is strengthened by the fact that only self DNA is taken up because it contains a signature sequence motif known as the DNA Uptake Sequence (DUS), which is 10 bp long and found in ~ 2,000 copies/genome. However, how competent Neisseria bind DNA and are able to discriminate self from non-self DNA remains a mystery. The identification and analysis of a DUS receptor would represent a major breakthrough and would improve both our understanding of DNA transformation and Tfp biology in general.

Our recently published systematic characterization of N. meningitidis genes involved in Tfp biology identified three minor (low abundance) pilins, one of which (ComP) plays a key role in competence. This prompted us to purify the ComP protein and test its DNA-binding activity, which led to a major finding: ComP has DNA-binding activity and shows a preference for the DUS (unpublished data). In this research project, we will (i) characterize thoroughly ComP's DUS-binding activity, (ii) determine a high resolution structure of ComP and the ComP-DUS complex and (iii) perform a detailed structure/function analysis of ComP's DUS-binding activity.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although proposing basic &amp;quot;blue-sky&amp;quot; research, this project will have a more general impact because it will lead to a better understanding of arguably one the most widespread virulence factors in bacteria. i.e. Tfp. Tfp might be present in 150 different species spanning most bacterial phyla and are the only pili present in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including many pathogens. As such, Tfp are primary targets for the development of new therapies against bacterial pathogens that place a heavy burden on human health and economy by infecting mankind, livestock and crops. Our work might thus benefit large Pharma (Pil proteins might be targets for the design of drugs interfering with the important functions mediated by Tfp), smaller Biotech companies (some of the NMR methodology/expertise developed during this project is likely to spill over into the BBSRC-funded CASE collaboration SM has with Arrow therapeutics) or not-for-profit organizations that are involved in developing new vaccines against pathogenic bacteria (minor pilins such as ComP might have vaccine potential against N. meningitidis as shown recently by VP's group).

Identification of the first type IV pilin with intrinsic ability to bind DNA. This shed light on the first step in DNA transformation, a key process which allows bacteria to capture free DNA and evolve rapidly.

2. Demonstration that this protein, ComP, allows Neisseria species to recognize their own DNA by virtue of its better binding to a specific motif abundant in their genomes called DUS.

3. Demonstration that this elegant mechanism to prevent indiscriminate transformation by foreign DNA is widespread. ComP and DUS variants were found in many species belonging to the Neisseriaceae family, which share the same ecological niche.

4. High-resolution 3D structure and functional analysis of two ComP orthologs defined unique structural features and a new mode of DNA binding adapted for exported DNA receptors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Tfp biology that has resulted from this research could have significant impact on the large academic community studying Tfp (and pili in general), and other related fundamental biological processes such as type II secretion.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8CD900D4-EBFC-4834-A5E2-C22AB435DAF6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/956369EB-AAD0-4904-AAFB-DB6A1E931BAA"><gtr:id>956369EB-AAD0-4904-AAFB-DB6A1E931BAA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exceptionally widespread nanomachines composed of type IV pilins: the prokaryotic Swiss Army knives.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>FEMS microbiology reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/dd9bdf3f312a11eadf15b34153592820"><gtr:id>dd9bdf3f312a11eadf15b34153592820</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Berry JL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0168-6445</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/301B3261-D7C2-4223-8995-43F1FDACFB71"><gtr:id>301B3261-D7C2-4223-8995-43F1FDACFB71</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Comparative Structure/Function Analysis of Two Type IV Pilin DNA Receptors Defines a Novel Mode of DNA Binding.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Structure (London, England : 1993)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/dd9bdf3f312a11eadf15b34153592820"><gtr:id>dd9bdf3f312a11eadf15b34153592820</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Berry JL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0969-2126</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B116D3F1-22E6-4516-A393-F671CB21C60A"><gtr:id>B116D3F1-22E6-4516-A393-F671CB21C60A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Specific DNA recognition mediated by a type IV pilin.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fa8fc00a9338caeddb1e4f3406b37eb2"><gtr:id>fa8fc00a9338caeddb1e4f3406b37eb2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cehovin A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9B866939-2B42-43B6-BB5A-3376D61B4804"><gtr:id>9B866939-2B42-43B6-BB5A-3376D61B4804</gtr:id><gtr:title>Functional analysis of the interdependence between DNA uptake sequence and its cognate ComP receptor during natural transformation in Neisseria species.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLoS genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/dd9bdf3f312a11eadf15b34153592820"><gtr:id>dd9bdf3f312a11eadf15b34153592820</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Berry JL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1553-7390</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/J016764/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BA89E2C-27FE-4553-819B-3CE27FC71EC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
