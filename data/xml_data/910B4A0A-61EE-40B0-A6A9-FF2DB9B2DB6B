&lt;p>The specific objectives of the follow-on study (involving collaboration with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Barclays Bank) are to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Conduct a panel survey tracking changes in SME finances in 2008-2009. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Conduct analysis on the data to inform policy makers about changes in the availability and cost of finance in 2008-2009. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Conduct econometric analysis to inform policy makers about the effect of financial constraints on firm survival and growth.&amp;nbsp; This involves a novel test of financial constraints based on the relationship between finance gaps (the difference between the demand and supply of finance) and firm performance. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Develop an innovative model of small business default risk, based on the default risk distribution, with the view to developing it commercially.&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;/li>

The presentation gave early evidence on the state of the market for SME finance in 2009 using data from UKSMEF 2009. The findings highlighted a continuing downward trend in the demand for finance and an increase in overdraft rejections in 2009. The analysis also pointed to low confidence among both credit officers and business owners.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UK survey of SME finances (UKSMEF) : key issues and policy implications</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D44867FE-789E-462F-B75C-04881925A93F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at De-Montfort University to disseminate key findings of UKSMEF.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Breedon Taskforce 2012</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71E53731-E390-4D3A-9955-182E58224863</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UKSMEF research influenced the Breedon Taskforce's 2012 examination and proposals to BIS on boosting finance options for businesses.

The CIB report (2011) highlighted that some creative content sectors e.g., Software and Publishing are more likely to have their finance applications rejected than non-CIBs with similar risk profiles leading to lower growth. The research formed the basis of for further focused investigation and discussion by the Creative Industries Council (CIC), a joint forum between the Creative Industries and Government; which led to the publication of the Creative Industries Council Access to Finance Working Group report (2011). The research was pivotal to the discussion contained within the report and its recommended initiatives were designed to address the finance situation of CIBs as highlighted in the research.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://applications.creativeengland.co.uk/assets/public/resource/38.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in BIS Finance Green Paper, 'Financing a Private Sector' (July 2010)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>842CD954-8DD5-4A03-819E-9BB48CCDB5A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research findings formed part of the evidence in relation to SME finances presented in the BIS Finance Green Paper, 'Financing a Private Sector' (July 2010).</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/31975/10-1081-financing-private-sector-recovery.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation by David Cameron</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AC4D2137-A04F-48E8-9F7D-375B41A24097</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The findings and analysis of EMB finance research was a major influence on the activities and recommendations proposed by Ethnic Minority Business Taskforce which was set up in 2007, for two years, under the Labour Government as a strategic influencing body to inform UK government policy and progress the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) business agenda. The research reported in Fraser (2009) drew attention to the Taskforce that: Black owned businesses are significantly more likely to be denied loans and pay higher loan margins than White owned businesses; but that these differences can be explained by non-ethnic risk factors such as higher rates of missed loan repayments and unauthorised overdraft borrowing ('financial delinquency'). The research helped to inform the Taskforce's recommendations proposed to the BIS on dealing with the underlying causes of financial delinquency such as poor financial skills, to which the Government published a response in its 2009 report 'The Government's Response to the Ethnic Minority Business Taskforce'. Developments in strategy and practice were implemented in light of the research to improve information flows from banks to businesses about the criteria used to make credit assessments.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.theguardian.com/politics/wintour-and-watt/2010/mar/17/davidcameron-conservatives</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in The Government's Response to the Ethnic Minority Business Taskforce (2009)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C8093AC1-44A3-40D7-96C1-1773267C731E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The UK Government's responses to the issues raised by the Ethnic Minority Business Taskforce, including the issues raised originally in Dr Fraser's research, are reported in 'The Government's Response to the Ethnic Minority Business Taskforce' (3 November 2009).
