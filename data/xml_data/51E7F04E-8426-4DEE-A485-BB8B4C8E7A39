The workshop will focus on outstanding issues in Harmonic analysis,High contrast problems, Dynamical systems and non-linear problems and on questions at the interface of these topics.It will provide a forum for new interdisciplinary work and also provide a supportive environment for young scientists and research students to become involved in the activities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed workshop will bring together analysts numerical analysts and other scientists who have a general interest in spectral problems. As well as these scientists the results, in the long term will be of benefit to the electronics industry (via nanotechnology) and the materials industry (when constructing high contrast materials). The workshop will have scientists who have active contacts with industry and they will inform their colleagues of the directions that the workshop goes in. As well as this the workshop will also address questions concerning the mathematics of new methods that in a few years time could become important in the manufacturing procedure. There will be a considerable element of 'technology transfer' between the participants. This will occur at the level of experienced scientists, who whilst being expert in their own field may have little up to date knowledge of developments in other fields. In addition we propose to invite a considerable number of postdocs and research students to the meeting. Not only will it be a chance for them to find new and interesting areas of work but there will be sufficient experienced people at the meeting who can act as mentors to them for the duration (and maybe after) the workshop has ended. We hope that this will be an additional benefit to young scientists, over the usual scientific ones. Like most research in Pure mathematics the benefits are likely to be seen in several years rather than the immediate future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37311</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H032274/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
