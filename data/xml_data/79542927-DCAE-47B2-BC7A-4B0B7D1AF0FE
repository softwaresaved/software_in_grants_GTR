Quantum correlated and entangled states lie at the heart of several major areas of physics, especially quantum optics, atomic physics and quantum condensed matter. The ability to control precisely a broad range of systems from ultracold atoms in optical lattices to internal states of molecules to semiconductor nanostructures has led to important breakthroughs in the understanding and potential applications of entanglement. Because the same principles underlie the rich but sometimes impenetrable physics of quantum matter, these advances open a window on challenging problems in materials. The fortunate fertility already evident in condensed matter materials suggests strongly that major benefits will accrue from exerting full quantum control of complex systems. Within this project we shall tackle this demanding new challenge. The underlying concepts and technologies of coherent control and manipulation in atomic, molecular and optical physics are now sufficiently established that it is possible to consider the synthesis of designer quantum states of atoms and molecules that can address a number of outstanding problems in condensed matter and optical physics. Furthermore, the ability to build large-scale quantum coherent systems represents such a new capability that we can anticipate new physics, as yet unimagined, as well as new technologies, to emerge.The method of approach will be to increase UK research capacity by the appointment of new faculty and the establishment of state of the art research laboratories and facilities, and the nurturing of collaborative research programs across several institutions. This will be complemented by implementing new training programs at the graduate and postdoctoral researcher level that will be broadly available to the UK community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1680651</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>557790</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Standard Research</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/I010580/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>578B5EE6-DF4A-4599-9BDE-2499393FF158</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>766427</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Standard Research</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/K003615/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>AA60974B-D44B-431D-B690-7D998BB5FBD0</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>490858</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>First Grant Scheme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/G026823/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>91794BBC-1921-45C9-B1F8-BC24E00A0C5D</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The work performed under this grant is primarily blue sky, and most impacts are expected to arise in the long-term. However, some specific economic and societal impacts have already arisen in the short-term.

The fact that we have significantly enhanced the UK competitiveness in a very vibrant, and ultimately very applicable field, has already had an immediate economic impact. Specifically, based on the scientific outcomes of this grant, we have attracted international funding into the UK, from both the EU and the US, that has already exceeded the original UK investment.
 
The scientific success of this grant, coupled with our active work on outreach and dissemination, has led to significant popularisation of the UK science, through coverage in popular-science outlets that are read by a very broad non-specialist community, such as Science, Nature, Physics World and Physics Today.

The fundamental nature and importance of our work has also already had an impact on education, with several of our findings (e.g. on Bose-Einstein condensation of atoms in a uniform potential) already being incorporated in undergraduate teaching at several universities worldwide.

Finally, this grant has already led to the development of the next generation of scientific and industrial leaders, with several postdoctoral researchers taking up academic and research positions at universities and national labs in the UK, Canada, France, Germany and China.</gtr:description><gtr:id>70FA1456-0DC4-46E9-BA26-2D921BDC80CC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The study of quantum coherence is an emerging field that has a potential for countless long-term practical applications in areas such as quantum information processing, precision sensing and navigation, and controllable design of modern functional materials with tailor-made properties.
Prior to this grant this area was underdeveloped in the UK, and our goal was to enhance the UK capability and international competitiveness by bringing in leading international experts and helping them develop state of the art research labs.
At Cambridge, under this grant we have hired two international leaders working on complementary fields - Mete Atature from ETH in Zurich (Switzerland), working on solid state systems, and Zoran Hadzibabic from the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris (France), working on ultracold atomic gases.
The objectives of this grant have been met and greatly exceeded. While the initial goal was to create two world-leading labs, one in each field, we now have five laboratories producing high-impact scientific results at a rate unprecedented in their fields in the UK.
Some highlights of our scientific findings include:
(a) First achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation of atoms in a homogenous, spatially uniform potential, which has realised in a textbook setting the goal theoretically set out by Einstein 80 years ago, and significantly enhanced the potential of ultracold atoms for quantum simulation of other quantum systems, studied in fields ranging from cosmology to material science.
(b) Studies of superfluidity in ring-shaped atomic gases, including the observation of long-lived quantised persistent currents, which form the basis for practical applications in atomtronics and rotation sensing. 
(c) Demonstration of high fidelity resonance fluorescence from a solid-state quantum system and generation of highly coherent single photons
(d) First demonstration of single-shot non-destructive readout of spin qubits in solids using tunnel coupled quantum-dot devices and resonant excitaiton</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>(a) In achieving Bose-Einstein condensation of atoms in a uniform potential, we have developed very general and transferrable experimental methods that will facilitate quantum simulation of a wide range of phenomena in labs around the world. Our methods have already been adopted by leading groups in the US and France.
(b) Our fundamental work on supercurrents in atomic gases has already led to more practical proposals for the development of sensing and navigation instruments in the UK and the US.
(c) Our technique on resonance fluorescence has been adapted by a majority of the community and boosted research activities in this field.
(d) Our results on single quantum dots are now being employed to other lesser known quantum systems in solids including single-atom impurities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>162B307B-B071-4CAD-8534-69FF6CE1237D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Electronics,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.amop.phy.cam.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/E036236/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B0D65A04-1D90-417F-9589-EA58474E36E3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cold Atomic Species</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
