This project is innovative on two counts: first, it argues that translation plays a key transformative role when religions travel from one culture to another; second, it analyses parallels between translation processes and religious conversion. These two issues will be investigated in the context of how western translation concepts and practices introduced in South Asia from the eighteenth century onwards fundamentally changed the way South Asians understood religious faith and identity.

The collaborators will apply a new set of translation questions on the transfer of religious concepts and identities in South Asia: how did translations of sacred texts into and out of Indian languages undertaken by European scholars from the early eighteenth century introduce new ways of constructing, defining and framing religious concepts in South Asia? The project team bring a fresh approach to the study of South Asian religions by arguing that this conceptual aspect of translation is intrinsic to the way religions began to be viewed, compared and categorized in the Indian context: whether core concepts could or could not be translated into other languages often determined whether a religion was considered a religion at all by European scholars.
 
The team will explore conceptual links between the translation of values and concepts across languages and the nature of conversion, in particular religious conversion. 'Translation' and 'conversion' are closely linked conceptually since both refer to processes of change and transformation. Although change is a fundamental aspect of both, it is not always clear how we understand why and how transformation occurs and what purpose it serves. Since the cognitive processes involved in both cases of transformation are available to us only through language, an analysis of shifts in linguistic terms reveal fundamental conceptual shifts. This project is innovative in the application of both conceptual and linguistic frameworks of translation in order to understand how the process of religious conversion can best be understood by an examination of changes in language choice. The investigators will examine parallel concerns regarding authenticity that vexes both translation and religious conversion where doubts regarding the sincerity of conversion are for the first time conceptually linked to translation anxieties regarding successfully &amp;quot;carrying across&amp;quot;. 

The collaborators will examine twenty conversion autobiographies written by South Asian converts to Protestant Christianity from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century in Tamil and Marathi and their translation into German and English. Social, political and intellectual reorientations in South Asia from the eighteenth century onwards meant that individuals experienced changes in many areas including the spiritual, which often required developing new vocabularies with which to describe these changes. The team will study shifts in how eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentieth-century South Asians represented their changed religious identities in their autobiographies, 'translating' or 'converting' lived experience into text and expressing their change in faith with a newly acquired religious terminology. They will investigate the selection of particular religious terminology when these conversion accounts were translated into German and/or English. They will also examine how the writing and translation of conversion accounts advanced Christian concepts to an Indian audience and to what extent conversion to Christianity was articulated differently across the three centuries. Through their analyses, the team aim to highlight the distinctive nature of translation in its ability to constitute and transform religious cultures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the UK, the government has indicated through policy documents that interfaith dialogue and other faith-based interventions have a significant role to play in the development of social cohesion. Such initiatives have been identified by the Government as a key feature of its policy objective of 'bringing people together in strong, united communities'. The act of conversion is a contentious area that can frequently create tensions between religious communities; relations between Hindu and Christian communities both in the UK and India have been strained partly as a result of general perceptions of the history of conversion and missionary practices. The project proposes to address this issue directly in the context of interfaith dialogue, providing resources for discussion of the conversion experience in a way which is both personalized (i.e. based on personal narratives) and sufficiently distanced in historical time to allow for measured reflection. The project will seek to encourage dialogue and reflection on these issues in a number of ways, and by engaging with a number of constituencies. Three main interest groups have been identified: a) interfaith practitioners, working with members of the South Asian communities in the UK from Christian, Hindu, Islamic and Sikh backgrounds; b) churches with large South Asian membership; and c) specialist organizations that support churches and missionaries working with South Asian communities in the UK. 

The investigators will collaborate with the following organizations, who have all indicated that they are prepared to host or take part in project-centred events:
-South Asia Concern, a London-based organization focused on issues in the South Asian diaspora, from a Christian perspective
-The Henry Martyn Centre, a Cambridge-based organization focused on world Christianity 
-The Hindu-Christian Forum, a national organization committed to developing Hindu-Christian relations
-The Faith to Faith Forum, a Christian organisation offering consultancy and networking services to practitioners who wish to engage with people of other faiths.

Some additional links and trajectories of engagement are planned as part of the project: 
-Churches with large South Asian communities in the UK are interested in 'reaching out' to South Asians in the UK as well as being involved in providing support and ongoing teaching to South Asian converts. 
-The Nehru Centre in London (the Indian equivalent of the British Council worldwide) organises a wide range of cultural events on its premises, showcasing Indian culture, including lectures, workshops, seminars and round tables, aimed at strengthening the intellectual dialogue between India and the UK. A presentation bringing out the literary and translation aspects of the project for a general audience along with discussion of what this means for community understanding today would be in keeping with the Centre's aims.
-The project website will be a resource for academics, missionary practitioners and the general public interested in the issues raised by the project. On-going information will be provided by collaborators in three main ways: by providing resources specifically designed to encourage interfaith dialogue; by providing a catalogue of conversion autobiographies; by maintaining a blog where the different collaborative partners offer regular posts on findings, with comments from project advisors and partners.
-Educational resources: the project seeks to have an impact on social cohesion agendas through the provision of materials for use in the English A Level Religious Studies curriculum and the Scottish Highers. Teaching materials will be developed and made available on the project website to support learning about issues of religious conversion and interfaith relations
-Interfaith Week 2016: the project aims to develop an event that initiates practical faith linked dialogues told through personal stories of individual conversion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159408</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A Battle for the Soul</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5823CE75-B187-46E5-9AAD-E35F4CAD16E4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Israel collaborated with Annie George an Edinburgh-based theatre artist to present conversion narratives that the research team had identified during archival research. Annie George prepared a rehearsed reading comprising extracts from several different narratives and woven together to form a single narrative. This involved several conversations where Dr Israel discussed the historical and cultural contexts of individual narratives with Annie George, emphasizing issues and themes central to the narratives. Once the script was written by Annie George, she discussed this further with Dr Israel to ensure that the narratives were presented in a nuanced way, maintaining the complexity of the texts and their contexts. While Dr Israel put together a ppt. slide of images to accompany the rehearsed reading, Annie George contacted a music composer who was able to offer a selection of music to accompany the readings.

The rehearsed reading was followed by a Q&amp;amp;A and discussion which were led by the project's Co-I, Dr. John Zavos, University of Manchester. There were several questions on issues of religious conversion and the history of British mission in India and the discussion in total lasted for approximately an hour after the reading.

The event was open to the public and approximately 40 people attended. Their interest in this aspect of South Asian history was stimulated and they were keen to be informed of further events that the research team planned to put together.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ctla.llc.ed.ac.uk/category/events/storytelling/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Transformation in Faith: Exploring Hopes and Fears</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B9301D08-B0F4-46DB-99E4-58185DB6CBE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two Theatre Workshops, Being Human Festival 2016, November 24, 2016, Edinburgh: The PI collaborated with Active Inquiry, a theatre company based in Edinburgh and Leith Open Space to offer two free theatre workshops open to members of the public. Entitled, 'Transformations in faith: Exploring Hopes and Fears' the two participatory workshops was to give participants an opportunity to explore how families and communities can respond to conversion sensitively. Participants could reflect on religious conversion and language through innovative theatre techniques where using image theatre techniques from Forum Theatre participants explored the meanings of terms associated with 'religion' and 'conversion'. The workshop was led by Gavin Creichton, artistic director of Active Inquiry. Both PI and German consultant on the project Dr Matthias Frenz participated in the workshops, with Dr. Frenz preparing and running a short after-dinner food quiz and discussion.
? The purpose of the first workshop was to invite participants to explore what each term meant for them by representing them not linguistically but by creating images with their bodies. Working individually and as groups, participants 'interpreted' several religious terms and reflected on these. The group at the end gave their impressions on how the nature of each distinct group's poses - e.g. suppliant, defiant, exalted - could be interpreted in terms of the topic of religious conversion. The second workshop invited participants to enact an unresolved encounter with religious conversion that one of the participants was willing to share with the group. Using the 'Rainbow of Desire' technique, the group enacted different conscious and subconscious desires on the part of the several 'characters' in that story. The workshop was followed by a discussion on how each participant felt as they explored 'helpful' and 'unhelpful' desires.
? The workshops were followed by a themed meal cooked by the World Kitchen Team in Leith, an offshoot of Leith Open Space. The PI met with the cooks in the team to discuss the themes and issues on religious conversion that the project raises. They discussed the impact of religious conversion has on the food choices and habits of individuals and their families. They decided to incorporate a range of food items that might be considered taboo by one religious group or the other thus offering points for discussion over dinner. Fay Young the director of LSO wrote two blogs in preparation for the event, raising awareness of how food taboos impact communities in a variety of ways.
? The workshops were advertised through the project website, Being Human Festival's brochures and website, University of Edinburgh's chaplaincy mailing lists, through Leith Open Space and World Kitchen Team members and through Edinburgh Interfaith Association's mailing lists.

Impact of theatre workshops: Feedback from the workshops were gathered in two ways, through a being Human Festival feedback form, informal sticky notes on a poster and through two video recordings.
? The workshops and meal were filmed along with short interviews of some of the participants and two short videos were uploaded on the project website. The interviews were an excellent source of feedback and reflection on the project themes. http://www.ctla.llc.ed.ac.uk/languages-religion-translating-hopes-fears/ 
? In order to gather impact evidence from the workshop participants, the following questions were sent out by email two months after it had taken place: 'How do you look back on the workshop?', 'Would you say the it changed or challenged your views on a particular issue?' Additionally, the email served to make the participants aware of the workshop video that had been uploaded to the project website in the meantime and they were asked whether the video triggers any specific memories or emotions.
? Participant response testifies to the long-term effects the theatre workshop has generated amongst the participants in terms of their knowledge about and attitudes towards members of different religious groups through sharing experiences of religious conversion. They stressed their positive impression of the workshop and the ways in which it allowed them to learn how to exchange views and ideas on religion and faith. For instance, one of the participants stated that she enjoyed engaging in &amp;quot;a lot of interesting exercises and [discovering] new sides in ourselves and the others.&amp;quot; In the questionnaire that was handed out to the participants before the workshop, this participant stated that her interest in religious conversion is, linked to her doctoral research and questions about why people convert and how this influences their 'Weltanschauung.' Her responses not only testify to the heterogeneity of the group of participants in terms of their religious and ethnic backgrounds, but also to the very specific expectations and questions they had in mind when they decided to attend the workshop. While one participant praised getting to know the &amp;quot;diversity and complexity&amp;quot; of the other participants, another's report testifies to how the workshop has enabled him to perceive a shared quest for belonging across religious and cultural differences: &amp;quot;I would say that it did make me reflect on why people try to convert others and why they themselves may be converted in their turn. We are all looking for a sense of Belonging [sic!].&amp;quot; One of the participants stated in the pre-workshop questionnaire that he was particularly interested in how to practice religion if one considers oneself as &amp;quot;secular&amp;quot; while referring to the specific context of Islamic faith. His response to the feedback afterwards demonstrates how the encounter and the exchange with the other participants of different faiths or none has enabled him to broaden this perspective. In a similar vein, the participants mentioned how the exercises and activities at the theatre workshop helped them to express and to share their personal experiences of religious conversion. For instance, one participant describes how he &amp;quot;learned [] that the most important thing in the sacred context is respect&amp;quot; and sums up the success of the workshop's objective of creating a space that enables interfaith encounter and communication: &amp;quot;I really enjoyed that night that though everyone has different beliefs, we respected and learned from each other. No matter what we believe, that belief must be the best in our perspectives, and we may want to share that belief with other people, but with the premise of respect. If everyone knows this, there would be no religious hatred, animosity or intolerance.&amp;quot;
? The workshops inspired one of the participants, who is an imam at the Edinburgh Mosque to write a blog post on their website (please see screenshots attached). He expresses his appreciation of the workshop, calls it &amp;quot;eye-opening&amp;quot; and testifying to the successful knowledge exchange: &amp;quot;We learnt many things, like: the importance of listening to what others have to say and 'disagreeing with respect' - someone may well have full conviction in one path, but they need to recognise that others may well have theirs.&amp;quot;
? Other participants, who did not respond to the feedback questions mentioned above, gave individual feedback via email. For instance, one participant described in the pre-workshop questionnaire their motivations to participate, which testified to the multitude of different perceptions of what religious conversion means and entails, and to the complexity of such experiences: &amp;quot;I was brought up as a Shia Ismaili Muslim. [] I wouldn't give myself the label of Buddhist but I like a lot of what it says. I guess I'm starting to realise that I believe that there are great and useful messages to take from every religion. [] I think that it is natural for us to change our thoughts about the nature of the universe multiple times over the course of our lifetimes so religious conversion is natural. However, I feel uncomfortable when people try to convert me [].&amp;quot; While this respondent's post-workshop feedback via email demonstrates the lasting learning effect the workshop has had on them, it also re-iterates interesting new observations they had formed in its wake. For example, recognising that some religious groups are taken more seriously in their evangelical practices than others and how addressing faiths that did not have any followers in the group might have been crucial to address this: &amp;quot;Whereas more mainstream faiths' attempts at converting people would have been harder to act out without feeling like we were being offensive and crossing some kind of socially acceptable boundary. (E.g. if we'd explored Protestants and Muslims). Especially if those faiths had been present in the group.&amp;quot;
? The video that had been uploaded on the project's website has also been received very positively by the participants and allowed them to recall in particular the communal dimension of the workshop by triggering happy memories, as the following statement by one of the participants demonstrates: &amp;quot;Most of the moments, where I am present at the video, depict me smiling; by watching the video I was reminded how much fun that workshop was: I met truly interesting people - all open-minded, eager to learn and challenge themselves.&amp;quot; Likewise, another participant states that &amp;quot;[watching] it reminded me what fun I had taking part in the activities and my learning from each other's experiences.&amp;quot; 
? Moreover, uploading the video on the project's website seems to have increased the website traffic as the Google analytics for the most recent period show (see PDF file attached.) While one participant in the video (Ben) testifies to the usefulness of exploring abstract concepts by engaging physically with them, Gavin Crichton, the artistic director of Active Inquiry, who let the workshop, points to how theatre practices have enabled an effective dialogue between the participants by overcoming &amp;quot;certainties&amp;quot; and pre-fabricated convictions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ctla.llc.ed.ac.uk/category/events/theatre/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Self-Transformation: Faith Journeys through Verse</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1FACF25C-041C-4803-842E-97414BF3B9D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Four Poetry Workshops (November 3-18, 2016) Edinburgh: The PI collaborated with Scottish Poetry Library (SPL) to run a series of four poetry writing workshops for members of the public. Entitled &amp;quot;Self-Transformations: Faith Journeys in Verse&amp;quot; the workshops were run by four different poets through SPL in November 2016 culminating in a Poetry Reading Evening as part of Interfaith Week Scotland, open to members of the public. The workshops were advertised through the project website, university chaplaincy mailing lists and through Edinburgh Interfaith Association's mailing lists.

? The research project focuses on the construction and function of autobiographical narratives of religious conversion. Since religious conversion is usually thought of as internal 'spiritual' processes, individuals can often struggle to describe emotional and spiritual change in words that can adequately describe such spiritual experiences that may seem beyond words. Such spiritual conversion experiences also have wider social consequences. Religious conversion can often challenge an individual's relationship with their families and communities and erects barriers hard to cross. 
? The poetry workshops were an opportunity for individuals to explore poetry as a powerful tool for expressing experiences of spiritual conviction and change. It also offered them an opportunity to communicate their perspective and their story to their communities and to a wider public, at the final poetry reading event.
? Each workshop was led by poets whose poetic repertoire reflects their engagement with faith and belief. The following four poets led one workshop each: Sam Tongue (http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poets/samuel-tongue), Tariq Latif (http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/profile-author/118465), Georgi Gill (Poet and Learning Manager at SPL) and Alan Spence (http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poets/alan-spence). Each aligns him/herself to different religious faiths (broadly Buddhist, Christian and Islamic traditions) and this ensured that a range of religious perspectives were offered at the workshops. The four poets and PI met twice as a group and discussed the themes and issues of the project and how these would feed into the workshops. Each poet wrote a blog for the project website, introducing themselves, their own experiences of spiritual awakening of conversion and invited participants to reflect on one of their poems or translate a poem before arriving at the workshop.
? Each two-hour workshop at the Scottish Poetry Library offered participants an opportunity to develop their poetic voice and increase poetic skills to communicate their spiritual and emotional journeys. Participants learned about traditions of poetry from other faiths as well as drew on the poetic traditions of their own faiths to compose poetry. By the end of each workshop, participants composed at least one poem in any style of their choice.
? Participants were encouraged to participate in the poetry reading event (November 18) an event organised as part of Scottish Interfaith Week 2016 at Storytelling Centre, Edinburgh. All four poets were invited to read from their work which was followed by participants reading poems they had written at the workshops. 
? Subsequently a few participants were willing to post their poems on the project website with an explanation of why and how they wrote each.

Impact in three ways:

? Impact on participants-there were approximately 15 participants at each workshop. All participants have given positive feedback on the workshops on their experience of reflecting on spiritual awakening and conversion and identifying appropriate tools with which to write about these issues.
? Impact on SPL-Georgi Gill, Learning Manager at SPL, has reported on the several positive outcomes of working with the project team on the workshops and poetry reading. For instance, many of the participants were new visitors to the Library; several have since gone on to become borrowers and engage with our website and social media channels. As she states in her letter of support: &amp;quot;Partnership on this project has had a number of positive outcomes for the Scottish Poetry Library. It afforded us the opportunity to work with several poets to devise a series of workshops that examined the issue of individual beliefs and faith journeys. Working with poets from different faith backgrounds (Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and Agnosticism) proved an effective way for the SPL to enhance the diversity of its programme and provision, both in terms of artist recruitment and audience participation. Through working with Dr. Hephzibah Israel to arrange the sharing event, the SPL participated in Interfaith Week for the first time, thus making new collaborative connections.&amp;quot; 
? Stimulated public interest in project theme: the poetry reading event attracted members of the public who were interested in the themes of the project.

a) Storytelling Event (Edinburgh, May 26 2016); 

b) Poetry Workshops (November 3-18, 2016) Edinburgh;

c) Theatre Workshops, Being Human Festival 2016, November 24, 2016, Edinburgh;

d) Teaching pack on religious conversion, targeted at the Highers/Advanced Highers curriculum. 

Impact arising from the above activities can be summarized in terms of cultural and societal impact on the general public, especially those who have faced religious conversion themselves or work with those who have faced religious conversion. The following are evidence of impact that has been gathered in the current reporting period in relation to the above activities.

a) Impact of project findings on Annie George, theatre artist: Ms George plans to use primary sources from the project to write a play on the theme of religious conversion in South Asia as well as linking this with South Asian diaspora in the UK. A rehearsed reading of a play script is planned for 2017-18, subject to funding application succeeding.

Additionally, the email served to make the participants aware of the workshop video that had been uploaded to the project website in the meantime and they were asked whether the video triggers any specific memories or emotions.
? Participant response testifies to the long-term effects the theatre workshop has generated amongst the participants in terms of their knowledge about and attitudes towards members of different religious groups through sharing experiences of religious conversion. They stressed their positive impression of the workshop and the ways in which it allowed them to learn how to exchange views and ideas on religion and faith. For instance, one of the participants stated that she enjoyed engaging in &amp;quot;a lot of interesting exercises and [discovering] new sides in ourselves and the others.&amp;quot; In the questionnaire that was handed out to the participants before the workshop, this participant stated that her interest in religious conversion is, linked to her doctoral research and questions about why people convert and how this influences their 'Weltanschauung.' Her responses not only testify to the heterogeneity of the group of participants in terms of their religious and ethnic backgrounds, but also to the very specific expectations and questions they had in mind when they decided to attend the workshop. While one participant praised getting to know the &amp;quot;diversity and complexity&amp;quot; of the other participants, another's report testifies to how the workshop has enabled him to perceive a shared quest for belonging across religious and cultural differences: &amp;quot;I would say that it did make me reflect on why people try to convert others and why they themselves may be converted in their turn. We are all looking for a sense of Belonging [sic!].&amp;quot; One of the participants stated in the pre-workshop questionnaire that he was particularly interested in how to practice religion if one considers oneself as &amp;quot;secular&amp;quot; while referring to the specific context of Islamic faith. His response to the feedback afterwards demonstrates how the encounter and the exchange with the other participants of different faiths or none has enabled him to broaden this perspective. In a similar vein, the participants mentioned how the exercises and activities at the theatre workshop helped them to express and to share their personal experiences of religious conversion. For instance, one participant describes how he &amp;quot;learned [] that the most important thing in the sacred context is respect&amp;quot; and sums up the success of the workshop's objective of creating a space that enables interfaith encounter and communication: &amp;quot;I really enjoyed that night that though everyone has different beliefs, we respected and learned from each other. No matter what we believe, that belief must be the best in our perspectives, and we may want to share that belief with other people, but with the premise of respect. If everyone knows this, there would be no religious hatred, animosity or intolerance.&amp;quot;
? The workshops inspired one of the participants, who is an imam at the Edinburgh Mosque to write a blog post on their website (please see screenshots attached). He expresses his appreciation of the workshop, calls it &amp;quot;eye-opening&amp;quot; and testifying to the successful knowledge exchange: &amp;quot;We learnt many things, like: the importance of listening to what others have to say and 'disagreeing with respect' - someone may well have full conviction in one path, but they need to recognise that others may well have theirs.&amp;quot;
? Other participants, who did not respond to the feedback questions mentioned above, gave individual feedback via email. For instance, one participant described in the pre-workshop questionnaire their motivations to participate, which testified to the multitude of different perceptions of what religious conversion means and entails, and to the complexity of such experiences: &amp;quot;I was brought up as a Shia Ismaili Muslim. [] I wouldn't give myself the label of Buddhist but I like a lot of what it says. I guess I'm starting to realise that I believe that there are great and useful messages to take from every religion. [] I think that it is natural for us to change our thoughts about the nature of the universe multiple times over the course of our lifetimes so religious conversion is natural. However, I feel uncomfortable when people try to convert me [].&amp;quot; While this respondent's post-workshop feedback via email demonstrates the lasting learning effect the workshop has had on them, it also re-iterates interesting new observations they had formed in its wake. For example, recognising that some religious groups are taken more seriously in their evangelical practices than others and how addressing faiths that did not have any followers in the group might have been crucial to address this: &amp;quot;Whereas more mainstream faiths' attempts at converting people would have been harder to act out without feeling like we were being offensive and crossing some kind of socially acceptable boundary. (E.g. if we'd explored Protestants and Muslims). Especially if those faiths had been present in the group.&amp;quot;
? The video that had been uploaded on the project's website has also been received very positively by the participants and allowed them to recall in particular the communal dimension of the workshop by triggering happy memories, as the following statement by one of the participants demonstrates: &amp;quot;Most of the moments, where I am present at the video, depict me smiling; by watching the video I was reminded how much fun that workshop was: I met truly interesting people - all open-minded, eager to learn and challenge themselves.&amp;quot; Likewise, another participant states that &amp;quot;[watching] it reminded me what fun I had taking part in the activities and my learning from each other's experiences.&amp;quot; 
? Moreover, uploading the video on the project's website seems to have increased the website traffic as the Google analytics for the most recent period show (see PDF file attached.) While one participant in the video (Ben) testifies to the usefulness of exploring abstract concepts by engaging physically with them, Gavin Crichton, the artistic director of Active Inquiry, who let the workshop, points to how theatre practices have enabled an effective dialogue between the participants by overcoming &amp;quot;certainties&amp;quot; and pre-fabricated convictions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>33B8EF6E-3E29-4C91-9419-86F6E8812877</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project team have discovered over 250 accounts of religious conversion from within the two areas of colonial South Asia that it focused on (Madras Presidency and Bombay Presidency). This number and variety of archival material was unexpected. This is evidence that many South Asians were engaging in narrating about their experience of transformation contrary to the view that it was British and German missionaries who were reporting on South Asian conversions. We have found that these accounts were translated, edited and published through a variety of means. Another key finding was that South Asian converts from the Tamil linguistic community (Madras Presidency) mainly wrote their accounts in English rather than in Tamil. In cases, where the account was written or narrated in Tamil, only the English survives. This is in contrast with the Marathi language where converts continued to write in Marathi and were translated into English. A third key finding was that converts to Catholicism also wrote conversion accounts--preliminary research had indicated that conversion accounts were written only by Protestant Christians but the materials in the archives suggest that this is not the case. This indicates that it was not just Protestant missions that expected a testimony of conversion because of the focus of Protestant Christianity on individual salvation and development but that Catholic missions too placed an importance on the writing and gathering of conversion accounts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The current findings suggest that there are many more accounts available in other language areas of South Asia and it would be possible to expand this project to study the kinds of accounts that were written in other languages and regions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>75C9BDFF-0CEE-469B-8693-12C268291949</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M003957/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8E63C4A9-31AC-4950-BF4C-643F945B707F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asian &amp; Middle Eastern Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E66DC80-F20F-4AC2-915A-AF46F5C6ED14</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interpreting &amp; Translation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B429D0DD-8AFA-4BA0-86CB-0857E81FC4B6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
