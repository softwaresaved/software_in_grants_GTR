&lt;p>The full sample of 400 women, 200 young offenders and 600 men will be tracked on the Police National Computer collecting data on offending history and re-offending over 12 months.

&lt;p>A longitudinal cohort of 9 problem gamblers, 9 non-problem gamblers and 9 abstainers from each prison (N=162) will be interviewed pre and post release to collect in-depth data on personal histories, crime, gambling and points of potential intervention through career narratives.

After my talk Marc Etches (Chief Executive of the Responsible Gambling Trust) emailed to say he had noted from the presentation that the relationship between gambling behaviour and gambling-related harm is complex and the observation that not all those that score as problem gamblers on the PGSI screen appear to experience harm may prove to be significant in the further development of methods that reliably identify and measure gambling-related harm.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Gambling, Crime and Health</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>362C50A2-048B-4B3A-BD66-04B5FF5CAB39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participants in the workshops (probation officers) were surprised to find the extent of gambling problems amongst prisoners and prompted questions on what could be done to address these difficulties.

Adrian Childs interviewed Prof. Corinne May-Chahal who was asked 'What led the team to do the research' (led out previous scoping study for DCMS), 'Isn't it the case that drugs and alcohol are bigger problems than gambling?' (Yes, but these are recognised and gambling harm receives less attention, if any. Gambling harm presents a serious problem for over 12% of prisoners and only a few prisons offer treatment) 'Doesn't gambling just pass the time' (Yes, and gambling is also used for educational purposes to help with numeracy levels. Boredom is an important issue and follows into the community - gambling can be a way of stopping boredom following release - case study given from qualitative interviews), 'Theoretically can stop alcohol and drug misuse but isn't it impossible to stop gambling?' (Yes, and gambling can be fun - stopping may not be the solution. Study design followed up 'abstainers', gamblers with no problems, and problem gamblers - abstainers drew on negative personal experiences to account for not gambling. Those who gambled without problems did so by setting themselves clear limits (case study given from qualitative interviews). 'If gambling in prison was treated effectively would we see a reduction in offending, in theory?' (In theory we would given the study found 6% of prisoners linked their current offence to gambling - case study examples given). Following the broadcast Prof. May-Chahal was approached for further information by Marianne Clough from Christians Against Poverty who are working in offender rehabilitation, Ian Bartlett from GamServe who wrote 'It was good to hear some of the vital research and gathering of evidence that you have been doing and I wanted to offer you encouragement and say well done' and Paul Buck (CEO EPIC) who works with businesses to alert them to gambling harm (and gambling related offences) in the workplace.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>GamCare Parliamentary Reception</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ED950214-E484-4695-AA32-E3757501FE30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research finding were discussed with industry executives and parliamentarians from both sides of the house.

Four different narratives were presented: 14% of male prisoners scored as problem gamblers on the PGSI of which the narratives of Joe and Chris were examples. They provided an example of both being vulnerable to gambling harm and committing offences as a result of problem gambling. Joe's story was characterised by 'loss, pain, heartache and ruination', whilst Chris 'my girlfriend left me because I was gambling and I felt depressed and everything else'. Jemma was one of the 10% of women in prison who scored as a gambler at low risk of gambling harm. She was sentenced for living off the proceeds of fraud. It is difficult to know from Jemma's story how much of her debt (and the reason for her coming into prison) was due to gambling. However, she did not associate the two. Mel - sentenced for Child Neglect and Possession of Drugs with Intent to Supply, scored as a Problem Gambler, as did 8% of the women prisoners. She also provides a further example of how drugs and gambling can be linked.

Three key contacts followed up with Prof. May-Chahal after the broadcast: Paul Buck (CEO EPIC - a consultancy that works with financial sector to prevent fraud related to problem gambling); Ian Bartlett (Co-Director of GamServe, a third sector organisation that aims to help problem gamblers) and Marianne Clough, National PR Manager, Christians Against Poverty. All requested further information on the project and took various actions to follow up, including and invitation to the launch of CAP Release Groups, a pilot scheme for prisoners on release, at Westminster on February 22.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A New Approach to Targeted Interventions for Problem Gambling in Prisons was presented to approximately 100 people from academic, treatment and industry backgrounds.

Data analysis to inform intervention and treatment needs within prisons suggests that, in order to reduce both offending and gambling harm, the majority of prisoners who gamble would be helped by gambling awareness programmes/media that respond to their lived experience of gambling harm and that approximately 6,000 men and women (6.8% of all UK prisoners) could require more intensive therapeutic interventions directed specifically at their gambling behaviour. These findings were presented in the conference paper A New Approach to Targetted Interventions for Problem Gambling in Prisons to a practitioner audience. Findings have also been positively received by probation officers attending workshops in the North West of England who agreed they consider gambling harm when working with offenders in the future.
