The project will undertake and develop a sustainable conservation policy for archaeological sites using the Asyut region in Middle Egypt, and the village of Shutb in particular, as a case-study. Rather than merely looking upon archaeological sites as salvage missions or narrow-eyed academic pursuits, the project supports local interests to better the lives of local communities so that they can function as working partners in preserving the site.

The envisioned methodology promotes (1) better integration of preservation and heritage management methodologies and specialists into archaeological fieldwork projects, (2) coordination and collaboration amongst different institutions and agencies concerned with heritage preservation, (3) engaging with local communities, local heritage professionals and other stakeholders through training and capacity building by hands-on experience and implementation of policies.

To achieve these goals, the British Museum will collaborate with an interdisciplinary team of Egypt-based consultants and local stakeholders to develop a set of protection measures in order to uphold Shutb's archaeological value, to prevent further decay of the historic fabric and to enhance the socio-economic (living) conditions of the inhabitants. 

To this means, two seasons of fieldwork in Shutb will include a series of surveys and meetings to assess the impact and perception of the village's presence on the archaeological remains, identifying and prioritizing meaningful ways of intervention and a documentation training mission. Many of the defined threats to heritage also negatively affect people's health, such as proximity to garbage disposal and ground and water pollution. The gathered survey data will be used to define programmes to reduce and redirect garbage dumping and improve waste and water management systems of residential units to reduce ground pollution and increase personal health. Depending on the outcome of the community meetings and interviews; the project will develop solutions to the community's most pressing needs. 

Such an all-inclusive approach has never been tested in Egypt, where fieldwork has traditionally been physically and intellectually separated from the surrounding environment and communities. It is, however, an opportune moment to develop more sustainable methodologies as ancient tells are at risk from the forces of nature and the impact of social, political, and economic change.Through collaboration with the Ministry of Antiquities, the impact of the established methodology can be accelerated if implemented at other sites or -even more fundamentally- incorporated into governmental strategies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Threats to Egypt's unique archaeological resources - not just pharaonic, but of all period - are not new, but intensified under recent political instability. Well-defined means and methods of mitigating the impact of those threats, policies and legislation have not been implemented in meaningful and sustainable ways that alter the conditions that brought about the increased illegal exploitation of archaeological resources nor did they impose preventative measures to restrict their looting, trafficking and destructive encroachment and vandalism. Sustainable heritage management can only be achieved by implementing preservation methodologies into archaeological fieldwork. 

Through a case-study in the village of Shutb in Middle Egypt, the project aspires to develop an innovative and sustainable fieldwork strategy by integrating preservation and heritage management methodologies and specialists into archaeological fieldwork projects, promoting collaboration amongst different institutions concerned with heritage preservation, empowering participation of local communities and heritage professionals as stakeholders through training and capacity building, and providing a model that could be sustainably deployed elsewhere. By not only developing, but also testing and implementing new methods of mitigating the impact of those threats in meaningful ways, the current project pledges to alter the conditions that bring about destruction of sites and illegal exploitation of archaeological resources. In addition, it seeks to define ways to integrate adjacent communities and other stakeholders as significant contributors to sustainable preservation. 

The need for such an undertaking has never been more pressing as intensification of land use by the rising population for agriculture and expanding settlements is rapidly destroying archaeological sites. In addition, the number of fieldwork projects in the region is increasing providing an opportune moment to address sustainable and meaningful efforts to preserve Egypt's heritage as part of archaeological excavations. The established methodology promotes collaboration amongst different institutions and agencies concerned with heritage preservation. It can easily be deployed and developed at other sites and could steer governmental attitudes towards fieldwork in Egypt.

Many of the defined threats to heritage also negatively affect people's health, such as proximity to garbage disposal and ground and water pollution. Any intervention will thereby also have an impact on people's lives. Depending on the outcome of the community meetings and interviews; the project will develop solutions to some of the community's most pressing needs. Certain urgent interventions, however, such as reducing and redirecting garbage disposal, will be implemented during the second fieldwork season. Through collaboration with the Ministry of Antiquities, the established methodological framework will potentially affect larger communities when implemented at other sites or even incorporated into governmental strategies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30350</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>239232</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NEWTON FUND INSTITUTIONAL LINKS</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>274662441</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>943CAECB-57B2-4A1B-A6B0-3DF03B1A564C</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>77366</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Translating Cultures and Care for the Future</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/P007724/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B2F55A61-CB02-46D0-A944-0CD77B3BFC9B</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Efforts to engage local stakeholders focussed on capacity building through documentation and training linked to the above mentioned activities. The impact was most substantial for local heritage specialist the Ministry of Antiquities. We considered this of prime importance as their cooperation is vital for the continuation and success of the project. The project was introduced during an information session in the Wikala Shalaby in the old city of Asyut. In October 2016, two additional training courses were organised in cooperation with the Asyut inspectorate; an introduction to pottery drawing and an emergency context documentation exercise. 
During the October season, the BM team in coordination with Takween acted as liaison between the different stakes holders in the World bank's improved sanitation or waste water project (ISSIP II). Concrete outcomes of the latter were a report on the impact of the project followed by a set of recommendations that can be adopted during its implementation, and a meeting attended by local representatives of the World bank project, engineers of the water company, the sheikh el-Balad (representing the village population) and local representatives of the Ministry of Antiquities. 
The impact of this project will be immense for the local community and the BM representatives on the ground found it important to convince the Ministry of Antiquities of this. Their initial reaction was to stop this project as it may affect archaeological layers below the modern village.
Given the special importance of the improved sanitation project in Shutb Village (Asyut Governorate); and in light of the current efforts of the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and the British Museum to preserve the existing archaeological site and the historic integrity of the village houses and urban fabric, a set of recommendations that can be adopted during the implementation of the sanitation project were formed by Takween Integrated Development:
First; the Improved Sanitation Project - if properly implemented -has a direct positive impact on improving the environmental and hygiene conditions of the village; as well as on the protection of the archeological site and the existing architecturally significant buildings.
Second; to achieve this positive impact, it is recommended to:
1. Adhere to Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) guidelines and regulations especially during the excavation works, under the supervision of a specialized consultant (i.e. excavation side supporting, shoring of adjacent buildings if necessary; and adhering to the HSE / Risk Management reports issued by the contractor and approved by the consultant);
2. As much as possible, implement excavation activities using manual methods and avoid mechanical methods especially in EL-Kom area (within the perimeter of Dayer El-Nahia);
3. Adhere to all the recommendations in the project's Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Report, and the World Bank standards in this regard (attached);
4. The new sanitation network - once operational - would lead to drying out the village's existing septic tanks currently used for sanitation on the medium-term. Hence, this is expected to reduce the soil's existing water content. This process would lead to shrinkage of the soil's top layers in El-Kom area, which would in turn affect the structural safety of the existing buildings on the medium-term.
Therefore, it is recommended to carry out a &amp;quot;Soil Shrinkage Study&amp;quot; before implementing the sanitation project. The study can be carried out based on the results of 5-6 Dry Boreholes by a specialized consulting entity such as the &amp;quot;Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering Unit&amp;quot; in Ain Shams or Asyut University. The study will included the Dry Boreholes findings, expected impacts of the project, and means to mitigate them - if any.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F854EBF0-D751-4A69-83FC-F6EA359E30F7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through different proposals, we will aspires to create a model for innovative and sustainable fieldwork initiatives, promoting increased empowerment of, and participation by, the local communities using the Asyut region in Middle Egypt, and the village of Shutb in particular, as a case-study. The village of Shutb, 5 km south of Asyut city, offers an excellent window into the micro-history of a rural community living on an ancient site. The village perches atop the remains of ancient Shashotep, a regional centre and capital of the 11th Upper Egyptian province from 2000BC onwards. The situation on the ground thus provides an ideal archaeological and anthropological context rarely preserved in the Egyptian Nile valley: a middle-sized provincial town combined with its hinterland in a continuous historical setting accessible for research.

The aim of the fieldwork in particular is to build the importance of and increase appreciation for recent tangible (in our case vernacular architecture) and intangible history (we will focus on story telling) and use that to create a model for establishing an understanding of the past (ancient buildings and stories). This is a long-term process, which will be addressed in several subsequent phases. For each of these phases, different funding will be sought.

The first two field seasons (Mar and Oct 2016) focussed on the visible remains of the ancient city of Shahhotep (modern Shutb in Middle Egypt) and the surrounding landscape. A stepped vertical trench of 10-10m on the western edge of the tell yielded several historical building phases. The study of the pottery identified three main chronological phases: (1) the 21st - 26st Dynasty (1070-525 BC), (2) the Byzantine period (5th - early 7th century AD), and (3) the end of the Ottoman period (1517-1867) to the beginning of the 20th century. Whether local or imported; most of the pottery could be identified as domestic pottery; tableware for cooking and food preparation, storage and transportation containers, and lamps. 

The geo-archaeological survey (by augur hand drill) on the edges of the town aimed at complementing this information. Through augering, the project hopes to identify the borders of the ancient city and understand the surrounding landscape, in particular in relation to the city of Asyut. For example, the biographical inscription in the tomb of Khety in the Asyut necropolis describes the fleet during the First Intermediate Period as being so long as to reach from Asyut to Shashotep, around 5km as the crow flies. From this we infer that both Asyut and Shashotep were on the river at that time. The results of this work are still being processed but preliminary observations suggest that the town historically migrated north-east to the location of the present village. Shards from the lower (augur) core levels suggest that the area was inhabited from the First Intermediate Period onwards. 
Documentation of the post-pharaonic history of the Asyut region started with a survey of the urban fabric and vernacular architecture in the village of Shutb in order to identify the most significant architecture worth documenting/preserving, their state of preservation and levels of integrity. Subsequent site visits focussed on the layout of inner and outer spaces and defining meaningful ways of intervention. This survey resulted in a 34-paged assessment report and a series of annotated maps created by Takween Integrated Development.

Efforts to engage local stakeholders focussed on capacity building through documentation and training linked to the above mentioned activities. Local representatives of the Ministry of Antiquities were included in different phases of the work. The March season closed with an information session in the Wikala Shalaby in the old city of Asyut. In October 2016, two additional training courses were organised in cooperation with the Asyut inspectorate; an introduction to pottery drawing and an emergency context documentation exercise.

During the October season, the Takween team acted as liaison between the different stakes holders in the World bank's improved sanitation or waste water project (ISSIP II). Concrete outcomes of the latter were a report on the impact of the project followed by a set of recommendations that can be adopted during its implementation, and a meeting attended by local representatives of the World bank project, engineers of the water company, the sheikh el-Balad (representing the village population) and local representatives of the Ministry of Antiquities. Both the latter as well as the assessment report will soon be made available on the British Museum website.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Because of the above outlined (STDF) funding problems, the second phase will overlap slightly with the first in that it is includes the finalising the documentation of the vernacular architecture. The following objectives will be addressed by the BM team under the coordination of the PI:

1. Finalise and refine the content of survey report
2. Finalising the documentation of vernacular architecture in Shutb (hand drawings, AutoCAD digital condition mapping, total station + photography) leading to defined plans for future conservation and restoration. This documentation will increase training for inspectors and members of the local community. I would like to note here that we had to carefully think about the different phases of this documentation project. The latter includes entering private spaces of people's houses. The local community has been incredibly welcoming but we did not want to bring in heavy equipment such as total station in the first phase to give them an opportunity to get used to our presence. 
3. Document local attitudes towards heritage and stories related to the history of the village using creative industries (drawing and film). We try not to call this a social study publically. The work will be done by integrating the (Egyptian) social officer into the architects team and engage with the owners of the house while documenting. We did a test of one day last season and this approach works well. This will mainly target children and young adults.
4. Follow-up on the wwp, continue context documentation training for local inspectors. 
5. Documentation of all activities by photography and film.
6. Production of Arabic booklets and preliminary report and engage with schools and representatives of the local community for distribution and information sessions.
7. Lectures and information sessions in the Ministry of Antiquities and foreign institutes in Cairo.
8. Finishing reports; dissemination through publication and the British Museum's website
9. UK-based training in documentation and adaptive re-use of historic buildings.

Future funding will be sought for the following activities (next phases):
- Use the enhanced appreciation for modern heritage to connect the modern with the ancient. Work with the local community to better understand the history of the village and have them perform ancient stories and use film to present that ancient heritage themselves. 
- Implement meaningful ways of intervention (still not clearly defined as depend on the social surveys)
- Integrate footage of the previous into British Museum display and other means of dissemination (website, Google cultural institute) to engage the UK audience with the context of the objects presented in showcases.
- Comparative research of the vernacular architecture in the Asyut region. Compare the rural Shutb context with the urban (Asyut city).
- Restore a few units of the vernacular architecture as preparation for adaptive re-use.
- Implementation of a multi-functional rehabilitation programme of the restored buildings in ways beneficial and sustainable for the local community (for example, community centre or women's health clinic).
- Prepare policy that allows the Ministry of Antiquities to implement methodology at other sites.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FD2DBF9E-0A94-4335-95E0-E4736DC7D68A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N009193/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
