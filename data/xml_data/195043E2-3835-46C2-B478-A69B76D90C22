The DNA consists of two strands that wrap around each other to form the iconic DNA helix. During DNA replication, the helix must be unwound to allow copying and chromosome segregation. This process generates DNA supercoils and DNA tangles that can block replication. Topoisomerases solve the 'unwinding problem' by introducing transient single- or double-stranded breaks into DNA that dissipate supercoils and allow DNA synthesis to proceed. It is not surprising that topoisomerases are essential enzymes but they also turn out to be vital targets of antibacterial and anticancer drugs that inhibit cell growth. We aim to use biochemical and X-ray crystallographic approaches to study two bacterial topoisomerases called topo IV and gyrase. We wish to understand how these proteins act at the molecular level and how clinically important drugs such as fluoroquinolones target their functions. The work will focus on the well-characterised topo IV and gyrase from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a dangerous human pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia and meningitis. However the research has wider applications to other bacterial and microbial systems. Progress in this key area should aid development of new drugs that work against antibiotic-resistant organisms, a growing threat to our healthcare system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Topo IV and gyrase mediate chromosome unlinking and DNA supercoiling and are targeted by clinically important antibacterial quinolones and other agents. Each enzyme transports a DNA duplex (the T segment) through a DNA gate made in a second DNA helix (the G-gate) in a process that involves the reversible formation of a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate called the cleavage complex. In recent advances, we have determined the X-ray crystal structures of cleavage complexes of Streptococcus pneumoniae topo IV formed with quinolone and quinazolinediones. Building on these and other structures and new biochemical tools, we aim to examine how DNA is gated through the DNA enzyme complex and how novel drugs interfere with this process. The work will involve a mutidisciplinary approach employing biochemical, X-ray structure, EM and SAXS approaches. Completion of the study will provide new insights on DNA gating during catalysis by topo IV and gyrase and its arrest by anti-topoisomerase therapeutics.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The pursuit of excellent basic research and its translation to drugs is an important feature of the proposal. The major beneficiaries who will be interested in or will benefit from the research are: 

The pharmaceutical industry developing new antibacterial topo IV/gyrase inhibitors as anti-infectives

Microbiologists and drug developers interested in combatting the mechanisms of drug resistance

1. The minimal requirements for DNA gating and transport by type II topoisomerases: importance for quinolone and structural studies.
We have invested considerable time and effort to develop an in vitro assay that measures the optimal arrangement of transported and gate DNA segments to ensure strand passage by topo IV. The main time consuming aspect has been the work needed to generate and validate the unique substrate required. This substrate can now be made in quantity and we are awaiting the outcome of assays with topo IV. Objective partially achieved. Ongoing. 

2. Role of protein intercalation and DNA bending at the gate
We have now overexpressed and purified a large number of ParC mutants carrying specific alterations at Ile170, the residue that intercalates into the DNA helix to promote substantial bending at the DNA gate. By complementing with ParE, we have reconstituted the corresponding mutant topo IV activities and used them to probe cleavage and catalysis at the wild-type and mutant DNA gates. Although further characterisation will be necessary, these mutants show a range of activities that illuminate enzyme action at the gate. Objective partially completed. 

3. Use of newly-developed protein/DNA reagents and new techniques in X-ray crystallography of topoisomerase complexes
We have developed several new tools and approaches to facilitate crystallography. First, we used fusion proteins of GyrB-GyrA and of ParE-ParC to stabilise complexes. Second, we used a second strong DNA site- the V-site, discovered by us during studies of the functional requirements for cleavage at the DNA. Third, we have been able to screen for crystals under higher than room temperature conditions. These modifications have allowed us to access high resolution structures of gyrase cleavage complexes and 3-gate structures of topo IV (see sections 5 and 6 below), two areas that had proven difficult heretofore. Original objective met.

4. Irreversible antibiotic trapping of the gate: selective reaction with clerocidin
A number of different approaches varying the DNA substrate have been tried in efforts to increase the resolution of topo IV complexes with clerocidin, an antibiotic with an unusual mode of action. Despite concerted efforts, thus far, we have yet to obtain co-crystals with a resolution greater than 4.5&amp;Aring;. Work ongoing. 

5. Focus on DNA gyrase: basis of selective quinolone targeting
By using fusion proteins comprised of GyrB and GyrA subunits, we have succeeded in a major goal of producing high resolution (3.2 to 3.6&amp;Aring;) structures of pneumococcal gyrase with DNA and three different quinolones. These structures finally allow comparison topo IV versus gyrase complexes for the same bacterial species providing insight on selective targeting. This work is currently being written up for publication. Original objective met. 

6. Higher order structures from X-ray crystallography, EM and SAXS 
We have solved the first crystal structures of an 'open clamp' 3-gate topoisomerase II-DNA complex, the seminal complex engaged in DNA recognition and capture. One complex involving E-site DNA stabilised with levofloxacin on topo IV was solved at 6.5&amp;Aring; (PDB ID: 4JUO): a second structure containing V-site DNA and no drug was solved at 3.7&amp;Aring; (PDB ID: 4I3H), revealing a bent DNA gate and a second linear DNA helix at a previously unreported site. This second DNA represents the first structure of a gate-DNA before association and bending at the gate. The ATPase domains comprising the enzyme N-gate are folded back and linked to TOPRIM domains on the same side of the enzyme, two features that ensure access for DNA and cleavage enhancing drugs. The structure is a significant advance in understanding the catalytic cycle of type II topoisomerases and has key impications for rational drug design. Original objective met.

(We have not pursued EM or SAXS approaches as work on gyrase has recently appeared (Papillon et al (2013) Nucleic Acids Res 41, 7815-7827) and is at far lower resolution (23 &amp;Aring;) than given by our X-ray structures). 

Additional work (not in the original proposal):
 
We have overexpressed and purified the ATPase domain of topo IV enabling structural and mechanistic work. 

The studies described above relate to the S. pneumoniae enzymes. Using recombinant means, we have also expressed a number of gyrase and topo IV proteins from Gram-negative pathogens that will allow comparison with the Gram-positive S. pneumoniae system. To aid such analysis, we have solved a crystal structure of a quinolone-DNA cleavage complex of Klebsiella pneumoniae topo IV (PDB entry 4PXP). Work has been accepted for publication-
