It will address four research questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>To what extent can data collection using a smartphone app improve our understanding of social worlds, simultaneously measuring:&amp;nbsp;social networks and their operation,&amp;nbsp;individual behaviour, and how these relate to the environment?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What are the ethical considerations to performing such studies, and to what extent do these differ between disciplines?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What are the practical, individual, cultural and social barriers to using this methodology?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Does the inclusion of social media feedback functions improve retention rates?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will compare the results of questionnaire-based survey methods with those collected via an App designed to capture self-reported changes in friendship networks and behaviour, GPS data on where, when and with whom adolescents spend their time, frequency and duration of texting and phone use. The App will also enable us to gather contextual data on young people's 'lived experience' via photo-journal/visual ethnographic data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Participants will be school pupils aged 16-18 who consent to participate.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact of this pilot study will be for academic beneficiaries. However, because smartphone apps could transform data collection in the social sciences, providing researchers with richer, more reliable data on which to build theory and knowledge, it has the potential to impact on a range of users in the longer term. 

For example, if the pilot study is successful, it could pave the way for a more substantive study on adolescent development, which could in turn provide policy makers from a wide range of government departments, and service providers from the statutory, voluntary and private sectors, with a better understanding of how spatio-temporal factors and peer networks influence the development of patterns of alcohol and substance use, delinquency, or healthy patterns of behaviour e.g. physical activity. This information could, longer-term, benefit adolescents via the development of policies or interventions designed to support optimal development, and minimise health problems or risky behaviour such as the misuse of alcohol, licit and illicit substances. This would also benefit society more widely, in terms of NHS costs, criminal justice and welfare costs etc.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196725</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>European Public Health Conference - Ethics Section Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2934D152-568D-4E53-B8E7-A61B6A95E02D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The analysis of ethics committee opinions of the Smartphones study was presented at a workshop organised by the Ethics section of the European Public Health Association at the annual meeting in Austria.

The principle impact of this research is the design of a new application for the Android operating system called &amp;quot;MobiQ&amp;quot;. 
MobiQ can:
schedule and issue survey questions;
take Global Positioning readings from participants' device;
record destinations of calls and SMS from the device;
record information identifying the device (e.g. phone number, make, model);
prompt and accept photographic responses from participants;
cache data in a secure cloud.
We are currently preparing to release the source code via open software repository.

We have delivered seminars and poster presentations describing the app, as well as the methodological challenges to using it in research at:
The University of Michigan Network on Inequality, Complexity and Health;
Glasgow University Urban Big Data Centre;
Nothern Ireland Child Care Research Forum Conference;
Queen's University Belfast Connected Health Special Interest Group

Data from baseline paper and pen surveys for both pilot schools have been summarised for the schools in plain English, in order to inform pastoral policies around substance use and well-being, and to increase teacher awareness of how pupils interact via new digital platforms.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A3623B07-4C6F-4700-83F5-F18A03AF4F7B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project team created a smartphone application (app) for android phones, to find out if members of the public could take part in research studies using their phones instead of using a pen and paper survey or online questionnaire.

The app was designed to send short questionnaires to the users' phones at weekly intervals, collect information on location (using GPS), collect information on how often they texted or called their friends, and it allowed participants to send photos of their social lives to the research team.

We conducted a study to find out whether or not people would use the app, what they thought of the app and the study, and whether or not the app worked and collected the information needed for research. This study focused on illicit drug use and social activities among school pupils between 16 and 18. We asked around 200 school pupils to complete a paper survey, online survey, and to download the app. 

We also spoke to research ethics committees from different academic subjects, to see if their concerns about this study were the same or different to those anticipated and addressed in the ethics application.

We found that most pupils completed the paper survey in school, but very few completed the online version or downloaded the app. We found a number of reasons for this:

1. Not all pupils had android phones. Apps for other types of phones could not collect the same information; and there were difficulties in installing apps on different phone types.

2. Young people have a sense of privacy about phones and social media and want to be in charge of what data they share. They felt uncomfortable about an app sending information when they couldn't see this happening. 

3. Among the pupils who did use the app, the survey data and calls and text information was of good quality and there was little missing information. The geographical (GPS) information was good quality, but some users did not have GPS enabled on their phone all the time. The app was not able to switch this on automatically.

4. Five school ethics committees provided feedback on the ethical application for the project. Cross-disciplinary concerns revolved around participants' anonymity and ensuring fully informed consent. Attitudes to the use of technology varied by discipline, in particular on the gathering of GPS data, which is a familiar approach in disciplines such as Geography, but less familiar to other social and health science disciplines.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings are of relevance to social researchers and research methodologists in other fields who may wish to consider using phone apps for data collection. In particular it can inform the level of resources needed to obtain a higher rate of app users. 

They can also provide guidance and advice to research ethics committees regarding issues of ensuring consent and privacy, and issues of collecting sufficient data.

While the app software itself could not be made available as a generic tool for all phones, the initial programming and learning from the issues raised can inform for further research app development.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>226CF738-D782-4AD9-A662-CA42C698E80D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/34633EF2-F0E0-4610-BF6A-D3F09DAE11FC"><gtr:id>34633EF2-F0E0-4610-BF6A-D3F09DAE11FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Conference paper</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e0950fd12b3985a7890948f6e95d8e98"><gtr:id>e0950fd12b3985a7890948f6e95d8e98</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McCann M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L003198/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BFE597D-D128-481A-A949-5847F619966F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
