Most of our communication is ostensive. Ostension is the difference between a pointed finger that is a by-product of looking at your watch, and a pointed finger that is designed to direct someone's attention.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our capacity for ostension means that any behaviour has the potential to be used in a communicative way. Indeed, much human communication is ostensive. It provides the foundation for many human institutions, including both language and culture. It appears to be species-unique, and it has clear evolutionary advantages. Despite this, many basic empirical questions about it are unaddressed. The Future Leaders scheme&amp;nbsp; will be used to experimentally investigate a range of fundamental questions about how ostensive communication systems operate. Specifically:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>what general qualities distinguish ostensive behaviour from otherwise similar behaviour (eg the pointing example - what distinguishes the two different points?)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how ostensive communication systems evolve, and hence develop conventional forms&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>what keeps human ostensive communication evolutionarily stable. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The findings of this empirical work will be applied to current debates about the origins and evolution of human language.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Because the research is highly interdisciplinary, the academic beneficiaries come from several disciplines (details are in the section 'Academic beneficiaries'). I will use the usual academic channels (journal publications, conference presentations) to disseminate my research to this audience. Because of the interdisciplinary audience I will, where possible, target interdisciplinary and/or open access journals. Further details can be found in the section 'Academic beneficiaries'.

As outlined in the Case for Support, ostensive communication is a fundamental component of what makes us human. It provides the foundation for language and culture, and depends upon a range of cognitive abilities that appear to be uniquely human. Consequently, the major non-academic beneficiaries will be members of general public interested in the origins and evolution of human behaviour and cognition, and more generally in what makes us human.

There is a large audience for such activities. Individual findings in this area are often reported in the popular press and in other popular science outlets. TV documentaries on related topics draw sizable audiences (e.g. the 2011 BBC series Fry's Planet Word had more than 1.5m viewers per episode), and the Royal Society and the British Academy have presented a number of joint events similar themes: in 2010 they presented a joint exhibition, Culture Evolves, at the Festival of Arts and Science, in which language evolution featured prominently; and in 2012 they ran a public engagement seminar What Makes Us Human?. Websites and blogs that cover these topics typically receive thousands of unique users each week, and often many more when a significant new finding is announced (data obtained from owner of Replicated Typo, a blog dedicated to study of cultural evolution).

I have developed a plan to maximise the engagement of this audience. It includes creating a website, articles in popular yet serious science magazines (e.g. New Scientist), and presentations at suitable science festivals. Full details are given in the 'Pathways to Impact' attachment. This plan will lead to a better public understanding of the following:
- The differences between human communication (and language), and the communication of other species
- The cognitive and psychological differences between humans and other species (many traits previously assumed to be uniquely human have since been found not to be, but ostensive communication does appear to be exclusive to humans)
- The ways in which human cognition and language evolved
More generally, I anticipate that my public engagement activities will lead to a better public understanding of humanity's place in the natural world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172850</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MacMillan Digital Science presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>780E1A48-2F33-49DC-A5CE-55DCA91D4FF4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of my book, Speaking Our Minds.

In what ways in human communication similar and different to that of other species, and how does it contribute to the spread of beliefs and ideas through human populations? Over the course of the grant I have addressed these questions theoretically and empirically. In addition to their immediate academic impact, summarised below, these findings advance our understanding of the evolutionary origins of the human mind and language, and as such will be of use to academics throughout the evolutionary social sciences.

Theoretically, I have (a) developed mathematical and computational models and (b) synthesised research from the several disciplines relevant to these questions: linguistics, evolutionary biology, primatology, cognitive science, anthropology, and philosophy of language. This research has collectively and conclusively shown that human communication is different to the communication of other species not just in degree, but also in kind. That is to say, human communication is not just an elaborate version of other types of communication; it is something evolutionarily novel. This in turns has helped to explain why only humans communicate linguistically, and also why human cultures and human societies are so different to those of other species, and particularly our primate relatives. This research has been reported in several journal publications, and collectively in a book, Speaking Our Minds, which has been widely acclaimed. It has had an immediate impact on the relevant branches of each of the fields of study listed above.

Empirically, I have conducted a number of experiments relevant to key aspects of this topic. Our current results will make important contributions to explaining what prevents widespread dishonesty in human communication, and what factors most influence the emergence of language structure. More specifically:
(i) It is presently believed that two factors - communicative efficacy, and learnability - make equal and opposite contributions to the emergence of language structure. Our results suggest that, contrary to this, communicative efficacy is the dominant factor.
(ii) It is not known exactly which factors prevent widespread dishonesty in human communication. Our results suggest that reputation is more critical than is widely believed.
These results have been reported at academic conferences. However, publishing these results has, unfortunately, been much delayed. This is for two main reasons. (a) The methodological challenges involved were more serious than anticipated, and the experiments hence took longer than originally planned. (b) The other commitments of my collaborators created some unanticipated but also unavoidable time delays. Still, both these problems have been overcome, albeit adding significant delay to the project. The results will be published in the academic literature as soon as is feasible.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My research provides a detailed description of the cognitive processes involved in human communication. It emphasises the role that the wider communicative context has on what utterances are produced and how they are interpreted. As such, it is feasible that my findings could be put to use in communication technology, and other related areas.

Academically, my research is highly relevant to the study of the evolutionary origins of the human mind. It helps to explain why no other species has language, and also why cultural practices and beliefs spread and stabilise so much more frequently and easily in humans than in other species. I have focused my dissemination of results on this area, and my work has had a correspondingly significant impact in the relevant fields
