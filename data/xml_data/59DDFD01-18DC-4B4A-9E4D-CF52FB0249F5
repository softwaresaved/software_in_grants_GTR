By 1730, a distinguished circle of Scottish poets, novelists, and philosophers had joined him there--and within a decade, Millar was the most important and trusted agent for Scottish and English literary interests in the newly-established British capital. This project will document and display the degree to which the Enlightenment was made financially possible, and indeed quite lucrative, through Millar's negotiations with readers in London, throughout England, and across the expanding Empire. Millar was an energetic promoter and fierce defender of his copyrights. For legal scholars, Millar's name is synonymous with arguments for private ownership of intellectual property that endure to this day. His social negotiations and the positions these spawned remain relevant three centuries later.

Readers normally associate the Enlightenment with purely intellectual developments. But its cultural flourishing was made possible through social and business interests negotiated by Millar. This project will draw on archival, technical, e-learning expertise to collect, edit, interpret, and showcase these negotiations for scholars, students, and non-specialists. The results will enable fresh thinking about the creation of historical documents, the interpretation of the past through new media, and learning about history through reflection on its social, financial, and legal conditions.

This project has three objectives: First, the completion of a book, titled &amp;quot;Creating Enlightenment: The Negotiations of Andrew Millar&amp;quot; (under contract with Oxford UP). Second, using an award-winning online platform run by Edina, the JISC-designated information service, we will create an interactive exhibition that will enable non-specialists to explore and understand the importance of social networks for promoting intellectual and artistic developments. These modules will also instruct users on how to identify and contextualize the archival sources that can now be found find online. Third, the project will host an international colloquium on the social and financial history of the Enlightenment in Britain, here at the University of Edinburgh.

A considerable proportion of preliminary research has been completed. In the first year, the PI will consult contextual materials and prepare editorial notes and the volume's Introduction. From Months 13-18, the research assistant will transcribe textual material and compile the bibliography. Also during Months 13-18, the e-learning team at Edina will develop the online modules. The School's Research Office will organise an international colloquium, &amp;quot;Negotiating Enlightenment: Sources and Legacies.&amp;quot; This major event will be hosted in the School of History, Classics, and Archaeology at Edinburgh, with contributions from our graduate students and colleagues, and funding support from external agencies. This colloquium will be held during the project's final month, which will mark the occasion for launching the project's interactive website, and submission of the book-manuscripts to Oxford UP. 

The University of Edinburgh is a world-leading centre for research in the intellectual, commercial, and material history of Enlightenment culture. It is home to the AHRC-funded SCRIPT centre for research in law, technology, and intellectual property, and the AHRC- and RSE-funded Centre for the History of the Book; with the National Library of Scotland nearby, this project team will benefit from outstanding local resources. Beneficiaries of the project will include a cross-disciplinary range of scholars and students, as well as teachers and non-specialists worldwide.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Impact Summary explains three key objectives of this project:
* The provision of a publicly-accessible and interactive web platform that features this research and trains users, particularly secondary-school students, to make further use of its archival materials;
* Organisation of a 2-day conference that will draw on resources beyond the University of Edinburgh and our project partner at Harvard University;
* Development of shared resources between this project and The John Murray Archive (National Library of Scotland), and the National Records of Scotland, for enhanced opportunities to jointly-host public events associated with this project.

WEB PLATFORM
Andrew Millar is a major figure in British cultural history precisely because his social networks and business concerns enabled the Enlightenment to flourish through investment in collaborative intellectual, philanthropic, and scientific projects. In the same way, adoption of an acclaimed web interface will invite teachers, students, and members of the public, to examine a showcase of archival materials including Millar's unpublished correspondence, in their manuscript and edited versions, with links to authorial notes, contracts, finished volumes, and contemporary accounts. This will provide virtual tours through Millar's negotiations and outcomes, complementing the book's richness and extending its reach. The PI will work with our local e-learning team during the final four months of the project, completing the explanatory modules and data-input from the emerging scholarly edition. We will seek the modest required funding from existing Knowledge-Exchange resources to maintain this platform over the years ahead.

Like a virtual museum or digital library, this part of the project will foster &amp;quot;public history&amp;quot; by enabling readers to browse and compare primary sources, at their own pace, with the choice of reading, listening, or viewing editorial explanation-with the scholarly editor acting in 'guiding' rather than 'controlling' roles. As sociologists of digital learning have shown, enabling public engagement with interactive platforms will encourage visitors to retain and return to the materials time and again. We are mindful of the technical and conceptual complexity of e-learning platforms for preserving and featuring historical documents. Accordingly, this project will draw on the expertise of local leaders in the field of digital pedagogy to ensure that our interface balances high-quality exhibition with accessibility, including the Digital Cultures and Education Research Group (DiCE), based in the School of Education. The platform and e-learning modules aim to respond to the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence (2011), particularly its section on Skills for Learning, Life, and Work, which emphasises electronic research skills and critical thinking about local and national history through independent research.

TWO-DAY CONFERENCE
The PI will apply for funds from the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Historical Society to host a 2-day conference, &amp;quot;Negotiating Enlightenment: Sources and Legacies&amp;quot;, inviting papers and exhibitions from local museums and publishing houses, to reflect on the history and interpretation of literary careers and publication in Britain during the Enlightenment. This event would be hosted by the School of History, Classics, and Archaeology, at the end of the grant period. This event will see the public launch of the interactive web platform. 

LOCAL COLLABORATIONS
Apart from its contribution to learning and teaching beyond academia, within and beyond the UK, further impact will result from opportunities for collaboration between the PI and local centres with remits for Knowledge-Exchange: the John Murray Archive (NLS); and the National Records of Scotland. 

The project team envisions exhibitions, open-access publications, hands-on workshops for teachers, and contributions to University's Visitor Centre.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160805</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture: Conversations Around Edinburgh on Brexit</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A316DDC8-FB5F-4D6A-BAB5-BC0CA865C551</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The University has sponsored Brexit and You, a series of public events about the UK's decision to leave the European Union.

FAMILY EVENT: Poetry in Edinburgh Before Burns
Talk and workshop with Dr Adam Budd, University of Edinburgh
With songs performed by Prof Kirsteen McCue, University of Glasgow

An afternoon listening to the sounds and stories of Scottish poetry, as it was written, performed, and sold in the Edinburgh High Street three centuries ago. During the years before Robert Burns came to Edinburgh, the High Street echoed with the sounds of local people and local stories, and many of these found their way into the poetry of time. Indeed, when the world learned about poetry in Scotland, they learned about the poems that were published here. This workshop was dedicated to an exploration of what these poems looked like and sounded like, and the stories they told.

Participants learned about two important poets: Allan Ramsay, who did all he could to keep the sounds of local Scots in the poems that were printed and sent all over Britain. A younger poet, James Thomson, tried to make Scottish poetry more &amp;quot;polite,&amp;quot; and he wrote gorgeous poems about the Scottish Borders that were among the most popular books ever written in English. Before Burns became famous, people from all over the world learned about Scotland, and Edinburgh, by reading Ramsay and Thomson.

The workshop considered what their books looked like, what the High Street looked like. Participants learned some Scots words from the time and then had the opportunity to write and perform their own poems of the eighteenth century. Kirsteen McCue, an international authority on the history and music of eighteenth-century poetry, sang for the event.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture: Colloquium on Literary Commerce</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C5142270-80FF-4688-A62A-E8E685BE1F03</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Funded by AHRC, Royal Society of Edinburgh, Centre for the History of the Book, and The Bibliographical Society.

The project involves:

 Professional learning: Fun, informative and high quality sessions for teachers

Online resources: Ideal for use in the classroom, as well as off-site visits to worldclass places in Edinburgh

A Great Young Minds Society: A club your class can join so that you can take part in visits, debates and activities with other classes and schools involved in the project, just like the great thinkers did during the Enlightenment.

A flexible package: Which allows teachers to pick and choose which bits work best for them and their pupils.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ewht.org.uk/learning/enlightenment-made-easy</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Talk: &quot;Publishing, Patronage, and the Library of Liberty: Andrew Millar and Thomas Hollis in 1765&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07006A10-23CC-433F-A1A9-1D52BD5A8643</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public talk at the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies, to 35 students, colleagues, members of the public, through the University of York.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This submission provides details of the dissemination of research findings among academic audiences, through publications, conference papers, colloquia, and talks in person, on television, and radio, that I have given in the UK, Canada, and France. Many of these presentations have been given to specialists and non-specialist but nevertheless largely &amp;quot;historical&amp;quot; audiences. Although the content of these presentations, and their discussion with audiences, took my research in exciting and at times unexpected directions, these outputs were anticipated and conventional aims of this research project.

Neither my research team nor I, let alone my academic colleagues, had anticipated the degree to which this project would produce findings that would be adopted by secondary-level teachers at various levels between S3 and S5 (Higher and Advanced Higher History), at Scottish schools representing various levels of educational attainment. Initial consultation with colleagues in the Moray School of Education (University of Edinburgh) and the Quality Improvement Officer of Edinburgh City Council (Secondary Education) in 2014, on the prospect of using materials from our Circulating Enlightenment website in classrooms, has led to the award of Professional Recognition for training in Historical Pedagogy by the General Teaching Council of Scotland--and this has enabled me to develop a Career-Long Professional Learning course for teachers on eighteenth-century culture in Edinburgh. Its materials draw directly from this research project.

Enthusiastic participation by more than 25 junior and senior teachers, with two local schools integrating elements of my research materials into their core History curricula at National 5 level, has been unexpected and enormously rewarding. This is generating evidence of impact at the level of informing public understanding of local history; shifting teachers and pupils' knowledge and attitude toward the past; and informing their critical enquiries into the meaning of current discourse on the nature and reach of Scottish literary and intellectual culture.

In addition to these quantifiable shifts in knowledge, opinion, and understanding, this activity is helping to raise educational attainment among lower-performing cohorts. Materials from this research project have been adopted by the History for Schools project at the University of Edinburgh, which places four teams of senior Honours students in classrooms across Edinburgh. Their aim is to help raise attainment through mentorship and support for collaborative learning--and these teams are using teaching tools and learning resources that have emerged directly from this research. 

We are collecting evidence of impact from these engagement activities, and may decide to submit these as an Impact Case Study at the next REF2021.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AFA04EE0-89D5-4DC7-806A-4AE847BEFD14</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Over the course of the funding period, this research project has exceeded its key findings--both its anticipated research outputs and its goals for Impact within and beyond the academic community.

The &amp;quot;key findings&amp;quot; that we had laid out were described as: (1) the publication of a major book on Andrew Millar's role in the flourishing of Enlightenment print culture on both sides of the English/Scottish border; (2) the creation of a new web-based learning tool that will enable general users to explore this material; (3) hosting of an international colloquium on Enlightenment print culture, featuring a range of junior and senior scholars, engaging with an academic and non-academic audience.

These have been achieved; the book will be published by Oxford UP in 2018, our website, Circulating Enlightenment, receives hundreds of unique visitors each month at http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk. Our colloquium was held at Old College, Edinburgh, in July 2016. It brought colleagues from five countries and, with support from the Royal Society of Edinburgh and The Bibliographical Society, funded travel costs for students from other universities.

The papers that I have given, here and abroad, are shaping teaching and research projects locally and further afield. They have attracted my involvement in PhD and MSc vivas, and have shaped the design of undergraduate courses in History and in English Literature. 

We now have a better understanding of the ways in which local controversies in Scotland, during the years between the Union of 1707 and the wave of investment and industrialisation of midcentury, shaped the business savvy and entrepreneurial spirit of Scottish literary agents in London. Andrew Millar did not just foster the lucrative careers of major Enlightenment authors through clever marketing and tenacious defence of his copyrights in Scottish and English courts; in fact, he supported the careers of anti-Enlightenment authors too--the very authors who attached those &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot; authors that we associate with his name (such as David Hume, John Home, Adam Smith, and William Robertson). Not only was controversy good for business, but the free exchange of controversial ideas furthered his own intellectual values--without controversy, readers were less likely to appreciate the social and moral meaning of the ideas they consumed. In these ways, Andrew Millar fostered debate and discussion just as much as his publishing business fostered the flourishing of literary careers among men and women who, it seems, were engaged in intellectual warfare with each other.

The project has led to a further research publication (a 13,000-word book chapter) and more than 20 instances of research impact through various kinds of community engagement--from close work with pupils and teachers in secondary schools representing different level of attainment, to interviews on BBC 1 (television) and BBC Scotland (radio); to lessons learned and shared about the prospects for Widening Access to university education through the circulation of teaching materials that draw directly on historical sources unearthed by this research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project's peer-reviewed scholarly outputs will be useful for historians, literary scholars, and bibliographers, and are available through publications that all web users can access through this university's open access policy. 

The General Teaching Council for Scotland has awarded Professional Recognition for the teaching materials that have grown directly from this research project, in the field of Pedagogy of Historical Research. This means that secondary-level teachers in all areas of Modern Studies (English, History, and Geography) can expect to use these materials &amp;quot;to meet the needs of the National agenda for digital literacy . . to be a rich source of interdisciplinary learning.&amp;quot; These materials are freely available to all teachers, through the project's Circulating Enlightenment website and through the School of History, Classics, and Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6F2DB283-B08E-41DD-A9E0-9A10892F3F5C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/adam-budd(dc7875e9-d1ef-4ab1-ac88-7f5f3821924b).html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The GTCS has awarded Professional Recognition to &amp;quot;Edinburgh Past and Present,&amp;quot; a CPD/CLPL course that I have developed, based on my research, and continue to deliver to secondary teachers in Modern Studies, Geography, and History, for junior and senior teachers in local secondary schools.

They will teach pupils, at S3 to Advanced Higher level, using historical materials (such as eighteenth-century maps) and electronic tools (such as digital mapping software) that have been developed through this AHRC-funded project. Further, by taking this course at the University, teachers can be confident that they will communicate to learners knowledge, skills, and reflective habits of mind that represent the state of the art. They will communicate to pupils the digital skills, intellectual value, and personal meaning of engaging with the past using reliable yet accessible resources.

This course was designed as an element of an Impact Case Study, and also as a means to extend our Widening Access strategy among lower-attainment groups in our local schools. 

Teachers have been keen to take this course, which has been recognised for Professional Standard for CLPL by the General Teaching Council for Scotland. Please see these two links for further details:
