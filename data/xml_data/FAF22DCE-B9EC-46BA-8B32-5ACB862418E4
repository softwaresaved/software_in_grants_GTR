This includes phylogenetic and more general genealogical trees, collision/partition histories in aggregation and fragmentation models as well as shapes in cluster/interface/crystal growth models. This has led to a variety of mathematical models in both discrete and continuum frameworks. Recent research has moved to trees incorporating additional structures such as spatial motions, measures, point processes or distinguished vertices, to trees undergoing a dynamical evolution of growth, reduction or restructuring, and to trees as tools to study richer combinatorial and continuum structures such as planar maps and sparse graphs. The aim of the research proposed for this project is to contribute to the literature on such models, with a particular emphasis on tree-valued random processes. While most goals are to answer natural questions of interest to probabilists, the methods will require some developments related to the geometry and topology of spaces of continuum trees.

David Aldous published his seminal work on the (Brownian) Continuum Random Tree (CRT) in 1991-93. Over the following 20 years, there has been a huge amount of work studying, generalising, relating and applying these initial concepts. Like Brownian motion is the universal scaling limit of discrete random processes with enough independence and finite variance (controlling large jumps), the Brownian CRT appears as the universal scaling limit of discrete trees with enough independence and finite variance (controlling vertex degrees).

To make mathematical sense of a convergence of discrete trees to a scaling limit, Aldous used embeddings of metric trees into the space of summable sequences. Evans and co-authors considered the set of isometry classes of compact tree-like metric spaces, for which geometers and others have developed a notion of convergence induced by a Gromov-Hausdorff topology. These ideas have been extended to deal with rooted trees, weighted trees and locally compact trees. When trees are also equipped with a planar order and the support of the weight measure is dense on the tree, the tree structure can be canonically encoded by a height function, giving access to stronger forms of convergence.

Three dynamics for uniform trees with n vertices/leaves have given rise to dynamics on continuum trees: the Aldous-Broder algorithm of root-growth with re-grafting, subtree-prune and re-graft and a leaf-removal and re-attachment algorithm now known as Aldous's diffusion in the continuum analogue. They are three tree-valued Markov processes that have as their stationary distribution the distribution of the Brownian CRT.

The study of models where non-uniform features persist for large n have naturally led to more general classes of CRTs. The two most prominent classes of such CRTs are Levy trees and self-similar/fragmentation CRTs, whose intersection consists of a one-parameter class of stable CRTs. These CRTs typically have, almost surely, a dense set of leaves and a dense set of branch points of infinite degree. For all these CRTs, there is a variety of Markovian growth and reduction procedures.

The principal aim of the research programme for this grant is to construct and study Markov processes with values in a space of continuum trees that have the distributions of self-similar CRTs or Levy trees as their stationary distribution. The study of Levy trees and self-similar CRTs is now reaching a stage where many properties and operations emerge that make this research very timely. Even though the examples for the binary Brownian CRT are analogues of simple discrete algorithms, there has been considerable technical effort, and the more delicate branching structure of self-similar CRTs and Levy trees make our proposed systematic study in the more general framework a challenging but feasible project with ample scope for exciting further developments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research under this proposal is in probability theory. This branch of mathematics, like many others, has pure and applied aspects. In this project, applications are at the origin, and possibly again at the end of pathways to impact that are likely to take several further steps. The intermediate stage, where the mathematical progress of this proposal is situated, is closer to the pure end of probability theory. 

The following two examples demonstrate possible time scales of pathways to impact for advances at the pure end of probability theory: 1940s stochastic integration has had impact on financial markets since the 1970s, and 1999 Lambda-coalescents have impact on 2010s genetics, which in turn has the potential for wider impact on society and economy. These examples also demonstrate that predicting even potential impact is not an exact science.

In the case of this proposal, there are very definite motivations in the applied sciences, with models under investigation that have been developed with applications in mind. Random tree models are used in many areas including population genetics, phylogenetics, the study of search trees in computer science, the study of classification trees in machine learning and statistics, rock breakage in mining and mineral processing, the study of coagulation histories of particles in physical chemistry and the study of the formation of galaxies in astronomy. The clearest pathways to impact are via these applications, some of which can have direct impact on society or economy, others can have indirect impact by playing their part in triggering medical advances. There may well also be new applications as the more recent computationally-intensive applications of those above demonstrate.

This project is about so-called continuum tree models, which arise as limiting objects when considering large finite tree structures. In most if not all of the above applications, the increase in computing power and improvements of technical equipment can give rise to larger and larger trees. One of the benefits of continuum models is universality: lots of discrete models converge to the same continuum model making modelling easier despite an apparent step up in technical sophistication. The challenge is to create an interface that makes continuum models available for modelling purposes. Part of this challenge is a thorough understanding and demonstration of tractability of the models, which we address in this research programme by proposing to develop the mathematical theory of such continuum models. The further parts of the challenge are the first steps on the pathway from this project via the applications to impact on society and/or economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>253682</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) TREE GROWTH

Although most of the research reported has only been available to others for a few months, there has already been interaction with the research by others in the area of the grant, specifically a paper by Broutin and Sulzbach on related fixpoint constructions of continuum random trees. Eventually, in a less direct way, some of the findings may be of some relevance in advancing the academic applications that motivated the models studied here, which then in turn may be taken forward outside academic research communities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>43D0A41F-0DD0-4FC1-870C-33E24E3624EF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~winkel/indexe.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/366EA2C6-283C-419B-9236-E133155D681F"><gtr:id>366EA2C6-283C-419B-9236-E133155D681F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Diffusions on a space of interval partitions with Poisson-Dirichlet stationary distributions</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3cc2f6dfb1e3e26f71d2ef90d6e04e00"><gtr:id>3cc2f6dfb1e3e26f71d2ef90d6e04e00</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Forman N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/71C04E98-2438-4E9F-9ED3-4A2777322262"><gtr:id>71C04E98-2438-4E9F-9ED3-4A2777322262</gtr:id><gtr:title>Uniform control of local times of spectrally positive stable processes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3cc2f6dfb1e3e26f71d2ef90d6e04e00"><gtr:id>3cc2f6dfb1e3e26f71d2ef90d6e04e00</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Forman N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0E8A0E53-F47C-47B1-A93B-0C5C9DF1AA05"><gtr:id>0E8A0E53-F47C-47B1-A93B-0C5C9DF1AA05</gtr:id><gtr:title>A binary embedding of the stable line-breaking construction</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/13daff96d3133294d0042b5b6b00287f"><gtr:id>13daff96d3133294d0042b5b6b00287f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rembart F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7EB54BE6-C475-4F7A-9D38-4DAF403EF8EA"><gtr:id>7EB54BE6-C475-4F7A-9D38-4DAF403EF8EA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Invariance principles for pruning processes of Galton-Watson trees</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7df34fe32c587ded57dd257cebc81430"><gtr:id>7df34fe32c587ded57dd257cebc81430</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>He H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/53C21E4B-60EF-49F6-A83A-3819A4AFEED8"><gtr:id>53C21E4B-60EF-49F6-A83A-3819A4AFEED8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Recursive construction of continuum random trees</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/13daff96d3133294d0042b5b6b00287f"><gtr:id>13daff96d3133294d0042b5b6b00287f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rembart F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K029797/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
