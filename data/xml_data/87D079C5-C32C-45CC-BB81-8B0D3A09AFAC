Privatisation has emerged as a cornerstone of the modernisation project in this sphere of public service provision. Yet we know relatively little about the relative quality and effectiveness of public and private prisons, their respective strengths and weaknesses, the cross-fertilisation of public and private sector practices, the objectives and aspirations of managers and staff in each sector, the ways that organisational values are expressed in practice at all levels of the prison organisation, and the impact of privatisation (and its threat) on the everyday culture and terms of imprisonment. There have also been few successful or systematic attempts to link differences in prison organisation and culture to important outcomes (such as reconviction). Debates about such issues have remained largely rhetorical, and there is a dearth of reliable evidence on which to base claims about the process and impact of privatisation and market testing. This study will draw on our substantial experience and expertise in the sociological study of prison life to offer the first systematic, empirical investigation of the values, practices, organisation and consequences of public and private sector corrections.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>395926</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Values, practices and outcomes in public and private corrections</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>050B9E45-D88C-4323-B808-709F91437F48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to representatives of Independent Monitoring Boards from contracted-out prisons</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Staff culture, use of authority and prisoner quality of life in public and private sector prisons</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BB442DDE-46B1-491F-BC17-7A53EFC7E0A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Podcast outlining the findings from the study</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://anj.sagepub.com/content/44/1/94/suppl/DC1</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prisons offer risks and rewards</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BE71C66A-D132-4EE2-9C92-790A57F090A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Study and authors quoted in article written by J.

The main aim of the project was to provide an in-depth account of management, practices, values and outcomes in contemporary corrections. More specifically, the objectives were to provide rigorous empirical evidence about the relative quality and effectiveness of public versus private prisons, and to describe differences in culture, relationships and experiences in the two sectors; and to provide an analysis of motivations, orientations and attitudes among senior practitioners in both sectors. 



In the senior manager study, we identified some clear professional styles, representing distinct approaches to the Governing task, with certain strengths and weaknesses, including different depths of moral vision. These were linked to personal and biographical characteristics and formative experiences during careers. We have defined these styles as: highly skilled operational; the performance-plus manager (including some technicists); entrepreneurs; moral dualists; thinker/speakers; and those who are alienated or complacent. We found few systematic differences between managers in the two sectors. It is a false assumption that public sector professionals are 'knights' - heroic altruists with professional ethics - or that private sector professionals are 'knaves' - pursuing only profit under any circumstances. 



Our typology of managers has two key axes: values and style. The balance within the Service has shifted towards the security, 'robust management' end of the style axis, while there is widespread unease with some liberal-humanitarian values and orientations in relation to prisons and prisoners. Many younger governors are uncritically focussed on performance targets, while, at more senior levels, a form of 'economic rationalism' dominates. Despite being almost like 'knights' in their public sector habits and orientations, the senior leadership have created a 'knave-like' culture in the organisation. Although largely unintended, this is having major effects on prison life.



In our evaluation of the two pairs of matched prisons, the two public sector prisons generally outperformed their private sector comparators. The public sector training prison scored significantly higher than its private sector comparator on seventeen of our twenty-one prisoner quality of life measures, and below it on none, while the public sector local prison scored significantly higher than its private sector comparator on eight of the measures and below it on none. Data from the three supplementary private prisons complicate this picture, however. One of the private sector training prisons scored significantly above the public sector training prison on nine of the twenty-one dimensions (and below it on none), while the additional private sector local prison scored significantly higher than the public sector local prison on fifteen of the twenty-one dimensions (and significantly below it on none). 



Both of the private prisons in the main ethnographic study exhibited weaknesses in the areas of policing and control, organisation and consistency, and personal development. Senior managers in both of these prisons acknowledged that their staff were less good at following procedures than those in the public sector, that the quality of uniformed staff and middle managers was highly variable, and that the high turnover of staff was a major problem. The emphasis in staff training on interpersonal skills - and the effort made to inculcate staff cultures that were positive and respectful - did not lead to our two main private sector prisons outperforming their public sector comparators in the expected areas. In these private prisons, relationships between prisoners and staff were courteous, and prisoners generally recognised that staff were benign and committed, but the lack of experience and expertise among uniformed staff (and their low numbers) meant that prisoners' legitimate expectations were often unmet. Alongside - and linked to - these problems with staff professionalism, there were problems in both prisons with both the over-use and the under-use of authority. 



In the public sector prisons, officers were confident and knowledgeable, delivering regimes that were safer and more reliable than in the matched private sector prisons. Relationships with prisoners were fairly informal, and power was generally exercised fairly and confidently. However, prisoners sometimes described an experience of imprisonment that felt 'heavier' and more 'edgy' than in the private sector comparators, and uniformed staff could sometimes be indifferent towards prisoners. Although their interactions with prisoners were often highly professional, their dispositions towards them were more negative than those of most private sector staff. 



The two high-performing private sector prisons that were added into the study combined the strengths of both sectors. Unencumbered by the cultural baggage of the public sector - in particular, a powerful trade union culture that tends to promote an ethos of cynicism - the relationships that staff formed with prisoners appeared to be largely respectful, supportive and caring. Uniformed staff seemed confident and knowledgeable, having built up more experience than staff in the poorer-performing private prisons. There were indications, nonetheless, that in the domain of security and policing even the high-performing private prisons were less strong than in other areas of quality.



The results from both studies constitute original and significant contributions to ongoing debates about prison privatisation and the nature of modern penality. They have been disseminated widely to practitioners (including Board members of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and senior executives in the private sector, as well as to individual establishments) and have been written up in the first two of a number of publications that will arise from the study. A revised version of the Measuring the Quality of Prison Life survey has been developed through conceptual and statistical analysis, has clarified our understanding of prison life, and has been adopted by NOMS as a 'moral' measurement tool to be used within all prisons. Prison Services in several other jurisdictions have asked to use or develop the survey, and it has already been used in our ongoing research activities (for example, a study of staff-prisoner relationships in HMP Whitemoor).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The study has generated considerable interest among practitioners in both sectors, and we have held feedback events and seminars with all of the prisons involved in the study and a broad range of represenatives from the public sector prison service and the private companies involved in prison management. Our main contribution has been to highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two sectors, and to add empirical evidence to debates about the merits and risks of prison privatisation. We have also been able to follow up our study by conducting research in HMP Birmingham, the first public sector prison in the UK to have been privatised.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>76FF5754-6EC1-4F80-9CCA-CBF53004EDA1</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.prc.crim.cam.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EE8D7F38-A85B-477E-85CB-A6466F3317A6"><gtr:id>EE8D7F38-A85B-477E-85CB-A6466F3317A6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Re-thinking respect in prison : results from a study of public and private sector prisons</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Criminology and criminal justice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e009932a609e41865aa934ab21fab5c0"><gtr:id>e009932a609e41865aa934ab21fab5c0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Susie Hulley (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FB73385A-FDAD-4265-B82D-3B9E439D1E7C"><gtr:id>FB73385A-FDAD-4265-B82D-3B9E439D1E7C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Staff culture, the use of authority, and prisoner outcomes in public and private prisons</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Australian &amp; New Zealand journal of criminology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/aa7bf1d393ef429e0929909d595dfa51"><gtr:id>aa7bf1d393ef429e0929909d595dfa51</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ben Crewe (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2ED501E4-451D-443C-8069-9B96E4897C5C"><gtr:id>2ED501E4-451D-443C-8069-9B96E4897C5C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Sage Handbook of Criminological Research Methods</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/87c59ccc0fe626e96d189876c3622fe1"><gtr:id>87c59ccc0fe626e96d189876c3622fe1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gadd, David; Karstedt, Professor Susanne (University of Keele, UK); Messner, Steven F.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781849201759</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-0212</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/E005381/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
