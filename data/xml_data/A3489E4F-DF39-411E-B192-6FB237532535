In order to do so, the consortium is built from very complementary expertise with knowledge on 3D printing, antenna, THz circuit and system.
 A first key element of WISDOM, is the use of 3D inkjet printing for fast fabrication of THz passive and active antennas. This approach will be combined with THz circuit designs in CMOS. Using multi-material 3D inkjet printing of functional materials to simultaneously deposit conductive and dielectric materials; including thermal and UV rapid solidification of deposited structures, efficient coupling between on-chip signals to free-space radiation will be achieved. This will lead to an important breakthrough that combines two cheap and high-volume technologies, paving a path to consumer-oriented THz products.
 A second key element is the combination of the 3D-on-CMOS printing technology with spatial-power combining array antennas, in order to develop highly-efficient THz beams that overcome the increased free-space path loss that prevents THz consumer products today.
 In WISDOM, we also plan to demonstrate the concepts with a smart spatial power-combining active array architecture for wideband THz wireless communications. The core WISDOM ICs will be used as active pixels providing spatial power combining with full individual amplitude and phase settings of each pixel in transmit and receive mode. Due to the use of 3D printing (for antennas) and CMOS process (for circuits), it dramatically reduces the cost of THz devices and systems while providing significant advances in THz frontend adaptability. A number of wideband antenna elements, arrays, on-chip active antennas as well as THz front ends circuits (&amp;gt;300 GHz) will be designed, fabricated and measured.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic impact:
The research proposed here will bring different communities, including RF and Microwave devices, THz devices, wireless communications, manufacturing, 3D printing technologies, circuits theory and designs, and wireless systems, together to carry out this pioneering work and the outcomes of this research are likely to have profound impacts across a range of areas in antenna, THz/millimeter-wave front end, wireless systems and 3D Printing technology, and bringing innovations and breakthroughs to current communication and radar technologies. 
The results of the proposed project will be conveyed to the beneficiaries and the general public via talks at department seminars (at Warwick, Kent, TU Graz, KULeuven), EPSRC funded CommNet meet-ings and workshops, invited talks at institutes and industries (e.g., IEEE DL talks), and discussions with our industry partners as well as publications in international journals (IEEE T-AP, IEEE Trans on THz Science and Technology, etc) and at major conferences (IRMMW-THz, EuMC, EuCAP, LAPC, IMS) for knowledge dissemination.

People Impacts:
This research will enhance UK's academic standing in the field of THz devices, RF &amp;amp; Microwave Communications, RF &amp;amp; Microwave Devices, 3D Printing and wireless communications, and will contribute to delivering and training highly skilled researchers, ensuring that they develop the skills matched to the demands of their future career paths. The project offers considerable potential for cross training of a new generation of research leaders in the normally separate silos of THz devices, antennas and propagation, 3D printing technologies, and wireless communications and circuits.
A selection of research findings will form part of teaching syllabus for MSc and final year under-graduates as well as for new generation of researchers. 

Economic and societal impacts:
Successful exploration of the proposed techniques is likely to provide solutions to future generation of wireless communications which demand significantly higher data rate and capacity. This proposal is timely and expected to contribute to future generation wireless systems, as the use of THz spectrum can solve the problem of spectrum shortage in current wireless communications, broadband satellite communications and radars.
The general public and communication service subscribers will benefit from super-fast broadband multimedia services using THz frequency bands.
The research will facilitate the generation of innovative applications in communication systems, benefits the communications industry with super-fast wireless link and enhances the UK's economic competiveness. The research finds will also be useful for UK national security and defence as the THz smart antennas will be potentially useful for improving the performance of radar imaging significantly.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157212</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P015840/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
